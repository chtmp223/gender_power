75	424	73	73	her	50	‘ We gave our best singer to the contest . Calliope , who rose , with her loose hair bound with ivy , tried out the plaintive strings with her fingers , then accompanied the wandering notes with this song . “ Ceres first turned the soil with curving plough , first ripened the crops and produce of the earth , first gave us laws : all things are Ceres ’s gift . My song is of her . If only I could create a song in any way worthy of the goddess ! This goddess is truly a worthy subject for my song . Trinacris , the vast isle of Sicily , had been heaped over the giant ’s limbs , and with its great mass oppressed buried Typhoeus , he who had dared to aspire to a place in heaven . He struggles it ’s true and often tries to rise , but his right hand is held by the promontory of Ausonian Pelorus , and his left hand by you , Pachynus . Lilybaeum presses on his legs , Etna weighs down his head , supine beneath it , Typhoeus throws ash from his mouth , and spits out flame . Often , a wrestler , he throws back the weight of earth , and tries to roll the high mountains and the cities from his body , and then the ground trembles , and even the lord of the silent kingdom is afraid lest he be exposed , and the soil split open in wide fissures , and the light admitted to scare the anxious dead . Fearing this disaster , the king of the dark had left his shadowy realm , and , drawn in his chariot by black horses , carefully circled the foundations of the Sicilian land . When he had checked and was satisfied that nothing was collapsing , he relinquished his fears . Then Venus , at Eryx , saw him moving , as she sat on the hillside , and embraced her winged son , Cupid , and said ‘
606	1009	588	588	you	51	’ So Venus spoke : he undid his quiver , and at his mother ’s bidding took an arrow , one from a thousand , and none was sharper , more certain , or better obeyed the bow . Then he bent the pliant tips against his knee , and with his barbed arrow struck Dis in the heart . ” “ Not far from the walls of Enna , there is a deep pool . Pergus is its name . Caÿster does not hear more songs than rise from the swans on its gliding waves . A wood encircles the waters , surrounds them on every side , and its leaves act as a veil , dispelling Phoebus ’s shafts . The branches give it coolness , and the moist soil , Tyrian purple flowers : there , it is everlasting Spring . While Proserpine was playing in this glade , and gathering violets or radiant lilies , while with girlish fondness she filled the folds of her gown , and her basket , trying to outdo her companions in her picking , Dis , almost in a moment , saw her , prized her , took her : so swift as this , is love . The frightened goddess cries out to her mother , to her friends , most of all to her mother , with piteous mouth . Since she had torn her dress at the opening , the flowers she had collected fell from her loosened tunic , and even their scattering caused her virgin tears . The ravisher whipped up his chariot , and urged on the horses , calling them by name , shaking out the shadowy , dark - dyed , reins , over their necks and manes , through deep pools , they say , and the sulphurous reeking swamps of the Palici , vented from a crevice of the earth , to Syracuse where the Bacchiadae , a people born of Corinth between two seas , laid out their city between unequal harbours . Between Cyane and Pisaean Arethusa , there is a bay enclosed by narrow arms . Here lived Cyane , best known of the Sicilian nymphs , from whom the name of the spring was also taken . She showed herself from the pool as far as her waist , and recognising the goddess , cried out to Dis , ‘
1011	1014	588	588	you	51	’ , and ‘
1019	1020	1021	1021	You	70	’ ‘
1075	1944	1065	1065	I	0	’ Speaking , she stretched her arms out at her sides , obstructing him . The son of Saturn could scarcely contain his wrath , and urging on the dread horses , he turned his royal sceptre with powerful arm , and plunged it through the bottom of the pool . The earth , pierced , made a road to Tartarus , and swallowed the headlong chariot , into the midst of the abyss . ” “ Cyane , mourning the rape of the goddess , and the contempt for the sanctities of her fountain , nursed an inconsolable grief in her silent heart , and pined away wholly with sorrow . She melted into those waters whose great goddess she had previously been . You might see her limbs becoming softened , her bones seeming pliant , her nails losing their hardness . First of all the slenderest parts dissolve : her dusky hair , her fingers and toes , her feet and ankles ( since it is no great transformation from fragile limbs to cool waters ) . Next her breast and back , shoulders and flanks slip away , vanishing into tenuous streams . At last the water runs in her ruined veins , and nothing remains that you could touch . Meanwhile the mother , fearing , searches in vain for the maid , through all the earth and sea . Neither the coming of dewy - haired Aurora , nor Hesperus , finds her resting . Lighting pine torches with both hands at Etna ’s fires , she wanders , unquiet , through the bitter darkness , and when the kindly light has dimmed the stars , she still seeks her child , from the rising of the sun till the setting of the sun . She found herself thirsty and weary from her efforts , and had not moistened her lips at any of the springs , when by chance she saw a hut with a roof of straw , and she knocked on its humble door . At that sound , an old woman emerged , and saw the goddess , and , when she asked for water , gave her something sweet made with malted barley . While she drank what she had been given a rash , foul - mouthed boy stood watching , and taunted her , and called her greedy . The goddess was offended , and threw the liquid she had not yet drunk , mixed with the grains of barley , in his face . His skin , absorbing it , became spotted , and where he had once had arms , he now had legs . A tail was added to his altered limbs , and he shrank to a little shape , so that he has no great power to harm . He is like a lesser lizard , a newt , of tiny size . The old woman wondered and wept , and , trying to touch the creature , it ran from her and searched out a place to hide . It has a name fitting for its offence , stellio , its body starred with various spots . It would take too long to tell through what lands and seas the goddess wandered . Searching the whole earth , she failed to find her daughter : she returned to Sicily , and while crossing it from end to end , she came to Cyane , who if she had not been changed would have told all . But though she wished to , she had neither mouth nor tongue , nor anything with which to speak . Still she revealed clear evidence , known to the mother , and showed Persephone ’s ribbon , fallen , by chance , into the sacred pool . As soon as she recognised it , the goddess tore her dishevelled hair , and beat her breast again and again with her hands , as if she at last comprehended the rape . She did not know yet where Persephone was , but condemned all the lands , and called them thankless and unworthy of her gift of corn , Sicily , that Trinacria , above all , where she had discovered the traces of her loss . So , in that place , with cruel hands , she broke the ploughs that turned up the soil , and , in her anger , dealt destruction to farmers , and the cattle in their fields , alike , and ordered the ever - faithful land to fail , and spoiled the sowing . The fertility of that country , acclaimed throughout the world , was spoken of as a fiction : the crops died as young shoots , destroyed by too much sun , and then by too much rain . Wind and weather harmed them , and hungry birds gathered the scattered seed . Thistles and darnel and stubborn grasses ruined the wheat harvest . ” “ Then Arethusa , once of Elis , whom Alpheus loved , lifted her head from her pool , and brushed the wet hair from her forehead , saying ‘
2194	2260	2261	2261	Jupiter	25	’ The mother was stunned to hear these words , as if petrified , and was , for a long time , like someone thunderstruck , until the blow of deep amazement became deep indignation . She rose , in her chariot , to the realms of heaven . There , her whole face clouded with hate , she appeared before Jove with dishevelled hair . ‘
