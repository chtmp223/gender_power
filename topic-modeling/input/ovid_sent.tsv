0	metamorphoses	I want to speak about bodies changed into new forms
1	metamorphoses	 You, gods, since you are the ones who alter these, and all other things, inspire my attempt, and spin out a continuous thread of words, from the world's first origins to my own time
2	metamorphoses	Before there was earth or sea or the sky that covers everything, Nature appeared the same throughout the whole world: what we call chaos: a raw confused mass, nothing but inert matter, badly combined discordant atoms of things, confused in the one place
3	metamorphoses	 There was no Titan yet, shining his light on the world, or waxing Phoebe renewing her white horns, or the earth hovering in surrounding air balanced by her own weight, or watery Amphitrite stretching out her arms along the vast shores of the world
4	metamorphoses	 Though there was land and sea and air, it was unstable land, unswimmable water, air needing light
5	metamorphoses	 Nothing retained its shape, one thing obstructed another, because in the one body, cold fought with heat, moist with dry, soft with hard, and weight with weightless things
6	metamorphoses	This conflict was ended by a god and a greater order of nature, since he split off the earth from the sky, and the sea from the land, and divided the transparent heavens from the dense air
7	metamorphoses	 When he had disentangled the elements, and freed them from the obscure mass, he fixed them in separate spaces in harmonious peace
8	metamorphoses	 The weightless fire, that forms the heavens, darted upwards to make its home in the furthest heights
9	metamorphoses	 Next came air in lightness and place
10	metamorphoses	 Earth, heavier than either of these, drew down the largest elements, and was compressed by its own weight
11	metamorphoses	 The surrounding water took up the last space and enclosed the solid world
12	metamorphoses	When whichever god it was had ordered and divided the mass, and collected it into separate parts, he first gathered the earth into a great ball so that it was uniform on all sides
13	metamorphoses	 Then he ordered the seas to spread and rise in waves in the flowing winds and pour around the coasts of the encircled land
14	metamorphoses	 He added springs and standing pools and lakes, and contained in shelving banks the widely separated rivers, some of which are swallowed by the earth itself, others of which reach the sea and entering the expanse of open waters beat against coastlines instead of riverbanks
15	metamorphoses	 He ordered the plains to extend, the valleys to subside, leaves to hide the trees, stony mountains to rise: and just as the heavens are divided into two zones to the north and two to the south, with a fifth and hotter between them, so the god carefully marked out the enclosed matter with the same number, and described as many regions on the earth
16	metamorphoses	 The equatorial zone is too hot to be habitable; the two poles are covered by deep snow; and he placed two regions between and gave them a temperate climate mixing heat and cold
17	metamorphoses	" 
"
18	metamorphoses	Air overhangs them, heavier than fire by as much as water’s weight is lighter than earth
19	metamorphoses	 There he ordered the clouds and vapours to exist, and thunder to shake the minds of human beings, and winds that create lightning-bolts and flashes
20	metamorphoses	The world’s maker did not allow these, either, to possess the air indiscriminately; as it is they are scarcely prevented from tearing the world apart, each with its blasts steering a separate course: like the discord between brothers
21	metamorphoses	 Eurus, the east wind, drew back to the realms of Aurora, to Nabatea, Persia, and the heights under the morning light: Evening, and the coasts that cool in the setting sun, are close to Zephyrus, the west wind
22	metamorphoses	 Chill Boreas, the north wind, seized Scythia and the seven stars of the Plough: while the south wind, Auster, drenches the lands opposite with incessant clouds and rain
23	metamorphoses	 Above these he placed the transparent, weightless heavens free of the dross of earth
24	metamorphoses	He had barely separated out everything within fixed limits when the constellations that had been hidden for a long time in dark fog began to blaze out throughout the whole sky
25	metamorphoses	 And so that no region might lack its own animate beings, the stars and the forms of gods occupied the floor of heaven, the sea gave a home to the shining fish, earth took the wild animals, and the light air flying things
26	metamorphoses	As yet there was no animal capable of higher thought that could be ruler of all the rest
27	metamorphoses	 Then Humankind was born
28	metamorphoses	 Either the creator god, source of a better world, seeded it from the divine, or the newborn earth just drawn from the highest heavens still contained fragments related to the skies, so that Prometheus, blending them with streams of rain, moulded them into an image of the all-controlling gods
29	metamorphoses	 While other animals look downwards at the ground, he gave human beings an upturned aspect, commanding them to look towards the skies, and, upright, raise their face to the stars
30	metamorphoses	 So the earth, that had been, a moment ago, uncarved and imageless, changed and assumed the unknown shapes of human beings
31	metamorphoses	This was the Golden Age that, without coercion, without laws, spontaneously nurtured the good and the true
32	metamorphoses	 There was no fear or punishment: there were no threatening words to be read, fixed in bronze, no crowd of suppliants fearing the judge’s face: they lived safely without protection
33	metamorphoses	 No pine tree felled in the mountains had yet reached the flowing waves to travel to other lands: human beings only knew their own shores
34	metamorphoses	 There were no steep ditches surrounding towns, no straight war-trumpets, no coiled horns, no swords and helmets
35	metamorphoses	 Without the use of armies, people passed their lives in gentle peace and security
36	metamorphoses	 The earth herself also, freely, without the scars of ploughs, untouched by hoes, produced everything from herself
37	metamorphoses	 Contented with food that grew without cultivation, they collected mountain strawberries and the fruit of the strawberry tree, wild cherries, blackberries clinging to the tough brambles, and acorns fallen from Jupiter’s spreading oak-tree
38	metamorphoses	 Spring was eternal, and gentle breezes caressed with warm air the flowers that grew without being seeded
39	metamorphoses	 Then the untilled earth gave of its produce and, without needing renewal, the fields whitened with heavy ears of corn
40	metamorphoses	 Sometimes rivers of milk flowed, sometimes streams of nectar, and golden honey trickled from the green holm oak
41	metamorphoses	When Saturn was banished to gloomy Tartarus, and Jupiter ruled the world, then came the people of the age of silver that is inferior to gold, more valuable than yellow bronze
42	metamorphoses	 Jupiter shortened spring’s first duration and made the year consist of four seasons, winter, summer, changeable autumn, and brief spring
43	metamorphoses	 Then parched air first glowed white scorched with the heat, and ice hung down frozen by the wind
44	metamorphoses	 Then houses were first made for shelter: before that homes had been made in caves, and dense thickets, or under branches fastened with bark
45	metamorphoses	 Then seeds of corn were first buried in the long furrows, and bullocks groaned, burdened under the yoke
46	metamorphoses	Third came the people of the bronze age, with fiercer natures, readier to indulge in savage warfare, but not yet vicious
47	metamorphoses	 The harsh iron age was last
48	metamorphoses	 Immediately every kind of wickedness erupted into this age of baser natures: truth, shame and honour vanished; in their place were fraud, deceit, and trickery, violence and pernicious desires
49	metamorphoses	 They set sails to the wind, though as yet the seamen had poor knowledge of their use, and the ships’ keels that once were trees standing amongst high mountains, now leaped through uncharted waves
50	metamorphoses	 The land that was once common to all, as the light of the sun is, and the air, was marked out, to its furthest boundaries, by wary surveyors
51	metamorphoses	 Not only did they demand the crops and the food the rich soil owed them, but they entered the bowels of the earth, and excavating brought up the wealth it had concealed in Stygian shade, wealth that incites men to crime
52	metamorphoses	 And now harmful iron appeared, and gold more harmful than iron
53	metamorphoses	 War came, whose struggles employ both, waving clashing arms with bloodstained hands
54	metamorphoses	 They lived on plunder: friend was not safe with friend, relative with relative, kindness was rare between brothers
55	metamorphoses	 Husbands longed for the death of their wives, wives for the death of their husbands
56	metamorphoses	 Murderous stepmothers mixed deadly aconite, and sons inquired into their father’s years before their time
57	metamorphoses	 Piety was dead, and virgin Astraea, last of all the immortals to depart, herself abandoned the blood-drenched earth
58	metamorphoses	Rendering the heights of heaven no safer than the earth, they say the giants attempted to take the Celestial kingdom, piling mountains up to the distant stars
59	metamorphoses	 Then the all-powerful father of the gods hurled his bolt of lightning, fractured Olympus and threw Mount Pelion down from Ossa below
60	metamorphoses	 Her sons’ dreadful bodies, buried by that mass, drenched Earth with streams of blood, and they say she warmed it to new life, so that a trace of her children might remain, transforming it into the shape of human beings
61	metamorphoses	 But these progeny also despising the gods were savage, violent, and eager for slaughter, so that you might know they were born from blood
62	metamorphoses	When Saturn’s son, the father of the gods, saw this from his highest citadel, he groaned, and recalling the vile feast at Lycaon’s table, so recent it was still unknown, his mind filled with a great anger fitting for Jupiter, and he called the gods to council, a summons that brooked no delay
63	metamorphoses	There is a high track, seen when the sky is clear, called the Milky Way, and known for its brightness
64	metamorphoses	 This way the gods pass to the palaces and halls of the mighty Thunderer
65	metamorphoses	 To right and left are the houses of the greater gods, doors open and crowded
66	metamorphoses	 The lesser gods live elsewhere
67	metamorphoses	 Here the powerful and distinguished have made their home
68	metamorphoses	 This is the place, if I were to be bold, I would not be afraid to call high heaven’s Palatine
69	metamorphoses	When the gods had taken their seats in the marble council chamber their king, sitting high above them, leaning on his ivory sceptre, shook his formidable mane three times and then a fourth, disturbing the earth, sea and stars
70	metamorphoses	 Then he opened his lips in indignation and spoke
71	metamorphoses	 ‘I was not more troubled than I am now concerning the world’s sovereignty than when each of the snake-footed giants prepared to throw his hundred arms around the imprisoned sky
72	metamorphoses	 Though they were fierce enemies, still their attack came in one body and from one source
73	metamorphoses	 Now I must destroy the human race, wherever Nereus sounds, throughout the world
74	metamorphoses	 I swear it by the infernal streams, that glide below the earth through the Stygian groves
75	metamorphoses	 All means should first be tried, but the incurable flesh must be excised by the knife, so that the healthy part is not infected
76	metamorphoses	 Mine are the demigods, the wild spirits, nymphs, fauns and satyrs, and sylvan deities of the hills
77	metamorphoses	 Since we have not yet thought them worth a place in heaven let us at least allow them to live in safety in the lands we have given them
78	metamorphoses	 Perhaps you gods believe they will be safe, even when Lycaon, known for his savagery, plays tricks against me, who holds the thunderbolt, and reigns over you
79	metamorphoses	"’
"
80	metamorphoses	All the gods murmured aloud and, zealously and eagerly, demanded punishment of the man who committed such actions
81	metamorphoses	 When the impious band of conspirators were burning to drown the name of Rome in Caesar’s blood, the human race was suddenly terrified by fear of just such a disaster, and the whole world shuddered with horror
82	metamorphoses	 Your subjects’ loyalty is no less pleasing to you, Augustus, than theirs was to Jupiter
83	metamorphoses	 After he had checked their murmuring with voice and gesture, they were all silent
84	metamorphoses	 When the noise had subsided, quieted by his royal authority, Jupiter again broke the silence with these words: ‘Have no fear, he has indeed been punished, but I will tell you his crime, and what the penalty was
85	metamorphoses	 News of these evil times had reached my ears
86	metamorphoses	 Hoping it false I left Olympus’s heights, and travelled the earth, a god in human form
87	metamorphoses	 It would take too long to tell what wickedness I found everywhere
88	metamorphoses	 Those rumours were even milder than the truth
89	metamorphoses	 I had crossed Maenala, those mountains bristling with wild beasts’ lairs, Cyllene, and the pinewoods of chill Lycaeus
90	metamorphoses	 Then, as the last shadows gave way to night, I entered the inhospitable house of the Arcadian king
91	metamorphoses	 I gave them signs that a god had come, and the people began to worship me
92	metamorphoses	 At first Lycaon ridiculed their piety, then exclaimed ‘I will prove by a straightforward test whether he is a god or a mortal
93	metamorphoses	 The truth will not be in doubt
94	metamorphoses	’ He planned to destroy me in the depths of sleep, unexpectedly, by night
95	metamorphoses	 That is how he resolved to prove the truth
96	metamorphoses	 Not satisfied with this he took a hostage sent by the Molossi, opened his throat with a knife, and made some of the still warm limbs tender in seething water, roasting others in the fire
97	metamorphoses	 No sooner were these placed on the table than I brought the roof down on the household gods, with my avenging flames, those gods worthy of such a master
98	metamorphoses	 He himself ran in terror, and reaching the silent fields howled aloud, frustrated of speech
99	metamorphoses	 Foaming at the mouth, and greedy as ever for killing, he turned against the sheep, still delighting in blood
100	metamorphoses	 His clothes became bristling hair, his arms became legs
101	metamorphoses	 He was a wolf, but kept some vestige of his former shape
102	metamorphoses	 There were the same grey hairs, the same violent face, the same glittering eyes, the same savage image
103	metamorphoses	 One house has fallen, but others deserve to also
104	metamorphoses	 Wherever the earth extends the avenging furies rule
105	metamorphoses	 You would think men were sworn to crime! Let them all pay the penalty they deserve, and quickly
106	metamorphoses	 That is my intent
107	metamorphoses	"’
"
108	metamorphoses	When he had spoken, some of the gods encouraged Jupiter’s anger, shouting their approval of his words, while others consented silently
109	metamorphoses	 They were all saddened though at this destruction of the human species, and questioned what the future of the world would be free of humanity
110	metamorphoses	 Who would honour their altars with incense? Did he mean to surrender the world to the ravages of wild creatures? In answer the king of the gods calmed their anxiety, the rest would be his concern, and he promised them a people different from the first, of a marvellous creation
111	metamorphoses	Now he was ready to hurl his lightning-bolts at the whole world but feared that the sacred heavens might burst into flame from the fires below, and burn to the furthest pole: and he remembered that a time was fated to come when sea and land, and the untouched courts of the skies would ignite, and the troubled mass of the world be besieged by fire
112	metamorphoses	 So he set aside the weapons the Cyclopes forged, and resolved on a different punishment, to send down rain from the whole sky and drown humanity beneath the waves
113	metamorphoses	Straight away he shut up the north winds in Aeolus’s caves, with the gales that disperse the gathering clouds, and let loose the south wind, he who flies with dripping wings, his terrible aspect shrouded in pitch-black darkness
114	metamorphoses	 His beard is heavy with rain, water streams from his grey hair, mists wreathe his forehead, and his feathers and the folds of his robes distil the dew
115	metamorphoses	 When he crushes the hanging clouds in his outstretched hand there is a crash, and the dense vapours pour down rain from heaven
116	metamorphoses	 Iris, Juno’s messenger, dressed in the colours of the rainbow, gathers water and feeds it back to the clouds
117	metamorphoses	 The cornfields are flattened and saddening the farmers, the crops, the object of their prayers, are ruined, and the long year’s labour wasted
118	metamorphoses	Jupiter’s anger is not satisfied with only his own aerial waters: his brother the sea-god helps him, with the ocean waves
119	metamorphoses	 He calls the rivers to council, and when they have entered their ruler’s house, says ‘Now is not the time for long speeches! Exert all your strength
120	metamorphoses	 That is what is needed
121	metamorphoses	 Throw open your doors, drain the dams, and loose the reins of all your streams!’ Those are his commands
122	metamorphoses	 The rivers return and uncurb their fountains’ mouths, and race an unbridled course to the sea
123	metamorphoses	Neptune himself strikes the ground with his trident, so that it trembles, and with that blow opens up channels for the waters
124	metamorphoses	 Overflowing, the rivers rush across the open plains, sweeping away at the same time not just orchards, flocks, houses and human beings, but sacred temples and their contents
125	metamorphoses	 Any building that has stood firm, surviving the great disaster undamaged, still has its roof drowned by the highest waves, and its towers buried below the flood
126	metamorphoses	 And now the land and sea are not distinct, all is the sea, the sea without a shore
127	metamorphoses	There one man escapes to a hilltop, while another seated in his rowing boat pulls the oars over places where lately he was ploughing
128	metamorphoses	 One man sails over his cornfields or over the roof of his drowned farmhouse, while another man fishes in the topmost branches of an elm
129	metamorphoses	 Sometimes, by chance, an anchor embeds itself in a green meadow, or the curved boats graze the tops of vineyards
130	metamorphoses	 Where lately lean goats browsed shapeless seals play
131	metamorphoses	 The Nereids are astonished to see woodlands, houses and whole towns under the water
132	metamorphoses	 There are dolphins in the trees: disturbing the upper branches and stirring the oak-trees as they brush against them
133	metamorphoses	 Wolves swim among the sheep, and the waves carry tigers and tawny lions
134	metamorphoses	 The boar has no use for his powerful tusks, the deer for its quick legs, both are swept away together, and the circling bird, after a long search for a place to land, falls on tired wings into the water
135	metamorphoses	 The sea in unchecked freedom has buried the hills, and fresh waves beat against the mountaintops
136	metamorphoses	 The waters wash away most living things, and those the sea spares, lacking food, are defeated by slow starvation
137	metamorphoses	Phocis, a fertile country when it was still land, separates Aonia from Oeta, though at that time it was part of the sea, a wide expanse of suddenly created water
138	metamorphoses	 There Mount Parnassus lifts its twin steep summits to the stars, its peaks above the clouds
139	metamorphoses	 When Deucalion and his wife landed here in their small boat, everywhere else being drowned by the waters, they worshipped the Corycian nymphs, the mountain gods, and the goddess of the oracles, prophetic Themis
140	metamorphoses	No one was more virtuous or fonder of justice than he was, and no woman showed greater reverence for the gods
141	metamorphoses	 When Jupiter saw the earth covered with the clear waters, and that only one man was left of all those thousands of men, only one woman left of all those thousands of women, both innocent and both worshippers of the gods, he scattered the clouds and mist, with the north wind, and revealed the heavens to the earth and the earth to the sky
142	metamorphoses	 It was no longer an angry sea, since the king of the oceans putting aside his three-pronged spear calmed the waves, and called sea-dark Triton, showing from the depths his shoulders thick with shells, to blow into his echoing conch and give the rivers and streams the signal to return
143	metamorphoses	 He lifted the hollow shell that coils from its base in broad spirals, that shell that filled with his breath in mid-ocean makes the eastern and the western shores sound
144	metamorphoses	 So now when it touched the god’s mouth, and dripping beard, and sounded out the order for retreat, it was heard by all the waters on earth and in the ocean, and all the waters hearing it were checked
145	metamorphoses	 Now the sea has shorelines, the brimming rivers keep to their channels, the floods subside, and hills appear
146	metamorphoses	 Earth rises, the soil increasing as the water ebbs, and finally the trees show their naked tops, the slime still clinging to their leaves
147	metamorphoses	The world was restored
148	metamorphoses	 But when Deucalion saw its emptiness, and the deep silence of the desolate lands, he spoke to Pyrrha, through welling tears
149	metamorphoses	 ‘Wife, cousin, sole surviving woman, joined to me by our shared race, our family origins, then by the marriage bed, and now joined to me in danger, we two are the people of all the countries seen by the setting and the rising sun, the sea took all the rest
150	metamorphoses	 Even now our lives are not guaranteed with certainty: the storm clouds still terrify my mind
151	metamorphoses	 How would you feel now, poor soul, if the fates had willed you to be saved, but not me? How could you endure your fear alone? Who would comfort your tears? Believe me, dear wife, if the sea had you, I would follow you, and the sea would have me too
152	metamorphoses	 If only I, by my father’s arts, could recreate earth’s peoples, and breathe life into the shaping clay! The human race remains in us
153	metamorphoses	 The gods willed it that we are the only examples of mankind left behind
154	metamorphoses	’ He spoke and they wept, resolving to appeal to the sky-god, and ask his help by sacred oracles
155	metamorphoses	 Immediately they went side by side to the springs of Cephisus that, though still unclear, flowed in its usual course
156	metamorphoses	 When they had sprinkled their heads and clothing with its watery libations, they traced their steps to the temple of the sacred goddess, whose pediments were green with disfiguring moss, her altars without fire
157	metamorphoses	" When they reached the steps of the sanctuary they fell forward together and lay prone on the ground, and kissing the cold rock with trembling lips, said ‘If the gods’ wills soften, appeased by the prayers of the just, if in this way their anger can be deflected, Themis tell us by what art the damage to our race can be repaired, and bring help, most gentle one, to this drowned world!’
"
158	metamorphoses	The goddess was moved, and uttered oracular speech: ‘Leave the temple and with veiled heads and loosened clothes throw behind you the bones of your great mother!’ For a long time they stand there, dumbfounded
159	metamorphoses	 Pyrrha is first to break the silence: she refuses to obey the goddess’s command
160	metamorphoses	 Her lips trembling she asks for pardon, fearing to offend her mother’s spirit by scattering her bones
161	metamorphoses	 Meanwhile they reconsider the dark words the oracle gave, and their uncertain meaning, turning them over and over in their minds
162	metamorphoses	 Then Prometheus’s son comforted Epimetheus’s daughter with quiet words: ‘Either this idea is wrong, or, since oracles are godly and never urge evil, our great mother must be the earth: I think the bones she spoke about are stones in the body of the earth
163	metamorphoses	 It is these we are told to throw behind us
164	metamorphoses	"’
"
165	metamorphoses	Though the Titan’s daughter is stirred by her husband’s thoughts, still hope is uncertain: they are both so unsure of the divine promptings; but what harm can it do to try? They descended the steps, covered their heads and loosened their clothes, and threw the stones needed behind them
166	metamorphoses	 The stones, and who would believe it if it were not for ancient tradition, began to lose their rigidity and hardness, and after a while softened, and once softened acquired new form
167	metamorphoses	 Then after growing, and ripening in nature, a certain likeness to a human shape could be vaguely seen, like marble statues at first inexact and roughly carved
168	metamorphoses	 The earthy part, however, wet with moisture, turned to flesh; what was solid and inflexible mutated to bone; the veins stayed veins; and quickly, through the power of the gods, stones the man threw took on the shapes of men, and women were remade from those thrown by the woman
169	metamorphoses	 So the toughness of our race, our ability to endure hard labour, and the proof we give of the source from which we are sprung
170	metamorphoses	Earth spontaneously created other diverse forms of animal life
171	metamorphoses	 After the remaining moisture had warmed in the sun’s fire, the wet mud of the marshlands swelled with heat, and the fertile seeds of things, nourished by life-giving soil as if in a mother’s womb, grew, and in time acquired a nature
172	metamorphoses	 So, when the seven-mouthed Nile retreats from the drowned fields and returns to its former bed, and the fresh mud boils in the sun, farmers find many creatures as they turn the lumps of earth
173	metamorphoses	 Amongst them they see some just spawned, on the edge of life, some with incomplete bodies and number of limbs, and often in the same matter one part is alive and the other is raw earth
174	metamorphoses	 In fact when heat and moisture are mixed they conceive, and from these two things the whole of life originates
175	metamorphoses	 And though fire and water fight each other, heat and moisture create everything, and this discordant union is suitable for growth
176	metamorphoses	 So when the earth muddied from the recent flood glowed again heated by the deep heaven-sent light of the sun she produced innumerable species, partly remaking previous forms, partly creating new monsters
177	metamorphoses	Indeed, though she would not have desired to, she then gave birth to you, great Python, covering so great an area of the mountain slopes, a snake not known before, a terror to the new race of men
178	metamorphoses	 The archer god, with lethal shafts that he had only used before on fleeing red deer and roe deer, with a thousand arrows, almost emptying his quiver, destroyed the creature, the venom running out from its black wounds
179	metamorphoses	 Then he founded the sacred Pythian games, celebrated by contests, named from the serpent he had conquered
180	metamorphoses	 There the young winners in boxing, in foot and chariot racing, were honoured with oak wreaths
181	metamorphoses	 There was no laurel as yet, so Phoebus crowned his temples, his handsome curling hair, with leaves of any tree
182	metamorphoses	Phoebus’s first love was Daphne, daughter of Peneus, and not through chance but because of Cupid’s fierce anger
183	metamorphoses	 Recently the Delian god, exulting at his victory over the serpent, had seen him bending his tightly strung bow and said ‘Impudent boy, what are you doing with a man’s weapons? That one is suited to my shoulders, since I can hit wild beasts of a certainty, and wound my enemies, and not long ago destroyed with countless arrows the swollen Python that covered many acres with its plague-ridden belly
184	metamorphoses	 You should be intent on stirring the concealed fires of love with your burning brand, not laying claim to my glories!’ Venus’s son replied ‘You may hit every other thing Phoebus, but my bow will strike you: to the degree that all living creatures are less than gods, by that degree is your glory less than mine
185	metamorphoses	’ He spoke, and striking the air fiercely with beating wings, he landed on the shady peak of Parnassus, and took two arrows with opposite effects from his full quiver: one kindles love, the other dispels it
186	metamorphoses	 The one that kindles is golden with a sharp glistening point, the one that dispels is blunt with lead beneath its shaft
187	metamorphoses	 With the second he transfixed Peneus’s daughter, but with the first he wounded Apollo piercing him to the marrow of his bones
188	metamorphoses	Now the one loved, and the other fled from love’s name, taking delight in the depths of the woods, and the skins of the wild beasts she caught, emulating virgin Phoebe, a careless ribbon holding back her hair
189	metamorphoses	 Many courted her, but she, averse to being wooed, free from men and unable to endure them, roamed the pathless woods, careless of Hymen or Amor, or whatever marriage might be
190	metamorphoses	 Her father often said ‘Girl you owe me a son-in-law’, and again often ‘Daughter, you owe me grandsons
191	metamorphoses	’ But, hating the wedding torch as if it smacked of crime she would blush red with shame all over her beautiful face, and clinging to her father’s neck with coaxing arms, she would say ‘Dearest father, let me be a virgin for ever! Diana’s father granted it to her
192	metamorphoses	’ He yields to that plea, but your beauty itself, Daphne, prevents your wish, and your loveliness opposes your prayer
193	metamorphoses	" 
"
194	metamorphoses	Phoebus loves her at first sight, and desires to wed her, and hopes for what he desires, but his own oracular powers fail him
195	metamorphoses	 As the light stubble of an empty cornfield blazes; as sparks fire a hedge when a traveller, by mischance, lets them get too close, or forgets them in the morning; so the god was altered by the flames, and all his heart burned, feeding his useless desire with hope
196	metamorphoses	 He sees her disordered hair hanging about her neck and sighs ‘What if it were properly dressed?’ He gazes at her eyes sparkling with the brightness of starlight
197	metamorphoses	 He gazes on her lips, where mere gazing does not satisfy
198	metamorphoses	 He praises her wrists and hands and fingers, and her arms bare to the shoulder: whatever is hidden, he imagines more beautiful
199	metamorphoses	 But she flees swifter than the lightest breath of air, and resists his words calling her back again
200	metamorphoses	‘Wait nymph, daughter of Peneus, I beg you! I who am chasing you am not your enemy
201	metamorphoses	 Nymph, Wait! This is the way a sheep runs from the wolf, a deer from the mountain lion, and a dove with fluttering wings flies from the eagle: everything flies from its foes, but it is love that is driving me to follow you! Pity me! I am afraid you might fall headlong or thorns undeservedly scar your legs and I be a cause of grief to you! These are rough places you run through
202	metamorphoses	 Slow down, I ask you, check your flight, and I too will slow
203	metamorphoses	 At least enquire whom it is you have charmed
204	metamorphoses	 I am no mountain man, no shepherd, no rough guardian of the herds and flocks
205	metamorphoses	 Rash girl, you do not know, you cannot realise, who you run from, and so you run
206	metamorphoses	 Delphi’s lands are mine, Claros and Tenedos, and Patara acknowledges me king
207	metamorphoses	 Jupiter is my father
208	metamorphoses	 Through me what was, what is, and what will be, are revealed
209	metamorphoses	 Through me strings sound in harmony, to song
210	metamorphoses	 My aim is certain, but an arrow truer than mine, has wounded my free heart! The whole world calls me the bringer of aid; medicine is my invention; my power is in herbs
211	metamorphoses	" But love cannot be healed by any herb, nor can the arts that cure others cure their lord!’
"
212	metamorphoses	He would have said more as timid Peneïs ran, still lovely to see, leaving him with his words unfinished
213	metamorphoses	 The winds bared her body, the opposing breezes in her way fluttered her clothes, and the light airs threw her streaming hair behind her, her beauty enhanced by flight
214	metamorphoses	 But the young god could no longer waste time on further blandishments, urged on by Amor, he ran on at full speed
215	metamorphoses	 Like a hound of Gaul starting a hare in an empty field, that heads for its prey, she for safety: he, seeming about to clutch her, thinks now, or now, he has her fast, grazing her heels with his outstretched jaws, while she uncertain whether she is already caught, escaping his bite, spurts from the muzzle touching her
216	metamorphoses	 So the virgin and the god: he driven by desire, she by fear
217	metamorphoses	 He ran faster, Amor giving him wings, and allowed her no rest, hung on her fleeing shoulders, breathed on the hair flying round her neck
218	metamorphoses	 Her strength was gone, she grew pale, overcome by the effort of her rapid flight, and seeing Peneus’s waters near cried out ‘Help me father! If your streams have divine powers change me, destroy this beauty that pleases too well!’ Her prayer was scarcely done when a heavy numbness seized her limbs, thin bark closed over her breast, her hair turned into leaves, her arms into branches, her feet so swift a moment ago stuck fast in slow-growing roots, her face was lost in the canopy
219	metamorphoses	 Only her shining beauty was left
220	metamorphoses	Even like this Phoebus loved her and, placing his hand against the trunk, he felt her heart still quivering under the new bark
221	metamorphoses	 He clasped the branches as if they were parts of human arms, and kissed the wood
222	metamorphoses	 But even the wood shrank from his kisses, and the god said ‘Since you cannot be my bride, you must be my tree! Laurel, with you my hair will be wreathed, with you my lyre, with you my quiver
223	metamorphoses	 You will go with the Roman generals when joyful voices acclaim their triumph, and the Capitol witnesses their long processions
224	metamorphoses	 You will stand outside Augustus’s doorposts, a faithful guardian, and keep watch over the crown of oak between them
225	metamorphoses	 And just as my head with its un-cropped hair is always young, so you also will wear the beauty of undying leaves
226	metamorphoses	’ Paean had done: the laurel bowed her newly made branches, and seemed to shake her leafy crown like a head giving consent
227	metamorphoses	There is a grove in Haemonia, closed in on every side by wooded cliffs
228	metamorphoses	 They call it Tempe
229	metamorphoses	 Through it the river Peneus rolls, with foaming waters, out of the roots of Pindus, and in its violent fall gathers clouds, driving the smoking mists along, raining down spray onto the tree tops, and deafening remoter places with its roar
230	metamorphoses	 Here is the house, the home, the innermost sanctuary of the great river
231	metamorphoses	 Seated here, in a rocky cavern, he laid down the law to the waters and the nymphs who lived in his streams
232	metamorphoses	 Here the rivers of his own country first met, unsure whether to console or celebrate with Daphne’s father: Spercheus among poplars, restless Enipeus, gentle Amphrysus, Aeas and ancient Apidanus; and then later all the others that, whichever way their force carries them, bring down their weary wandering waters to the sea
233	metamorphoses	 Only Inachus is missing, but hidden in the deepest cave he swells his stream with tears, and in utter misery laments his lost daughter, Io, not knowing if she is alive or among the shades
234	metamorphoses	 Since he cannot find her anywhere, he imagines her nowhere, and his heart fears worse than death
235	metamorphoses	Jupiter first saw her returning from her father’s stream, and said ‘Virgin, worthy of Jupiter himself, who will make some unknown man happy when you share his bed, while it is hot and the sun is at the highest point of its arc, find shade in the deep woods! (And he showed her the woods’ shade)
236	metamorphoses	 But if you are afraid to enter the wild beasts’ lairs, you can go into the remote woods in safety, protected by a god, and not by any lesser god, but by the one who holds the sceptre of heaven in his mighty hand, and who hurls the flickering bolts of lightning
237	metamorphoses	 Do not fly from me!’ She was already in flight
238	metamorphoses	 She had left behind Lerna’s pastures, and the Lyrcean plain’s wooded fields, when the god hid the wide earth in a covering of fog, caught the fleeing girl, and raped her
239	metamorphoses	Meanwhile Juno looked down into the heart of Argos, surprised that rapid mists had created night in shining daylight
240	metamorphoses	 She knew they were not vapours from the river, or breath from the damp earth
241	metamorphoses	 She looked around to see where her husband was, knowing by now the intrigues of a spouse so often caught in the act
242	metamorphoses	 When she could not find him in the skies, she said ‘Either I am wrong, or being wronged’ and gliding down from heaven’s peak, she stood on earth ordering the clouds to melt
243	metamorphoses	 Jupiter had a presage of his wife’s arrival and had changed Inachus’s daughter into a gleaming heifer
244	metamorphoses	 Even in that form she was beautiful
245	metamorphoses	 Saturnia approved the animal’s looks, though grudgingly, asking, then, whose she was, where from, what herd, as if she did not know
246	metamorphoses	 Jupiter, to stop all inquiry, lied, saying she had been born from the earth
247	metamorphoses	 Then Saturnia claimed her as a gift
248	metamorphoses	 What could he do? Cruel to sacrifice his love, but suspicious not to
249	metamorphoses	 Shame urges him to it, Amor urges not
250	metamorphoses	" Amor would have conquered Shame, but if he refused so slight a gift as a heifer to the companion of his race and bed, it might appear no heifer!
"
251	metamorphoses	Though her rival was given up the goddess did not abandon her fears at once, cautious of Jupiter and afraid of his trickery, until she had given Io into Argus’s keeping, that son of Arestor
252	metamorphoses	 Argus had a hundred eyes round his head, that took their rest two at a time in succession while the others kept watch and stayed on guard
253	metamorphoses	 Wherever he stood he was looking at Io, and had Io in front of his eyes when his back was turned
254	metamorphoses	 He let her graze in the light, but when the sun sank below the earth, he penned her, and fastened a rope round her innocent neck
255	metamorphoses	 She grazed on the leaves of trees and bitter herbs
256	metamorphoses	 She often lay on the bare ground, and the poor thing drank water from muddy streams
257	metamorphoses	 When she wished to stretch her arms out to Argus in supplication, she had no arms to stretch
258	metamorphoses	 Trying to complain, a lowing came from her mouth, and she was alarmed and frightened by the sound of her own voice
259	metamorphoses	 When she came to Inachus’s riverbanks where she often used to play and saw her gaping mouth and her new horns in the water, she grew frightened and fled terrified of herself
260	metamorphoses	The naiads did not know her: Inachus himself did not know her, but she followed her father, followed her sisters, allowing herself to be petted, and offering herself to be admired
261	metamorphoses	 Old Inachus pulled some grasses and held them out to her: she licked her father’s hand and kissed his palm, could not hold back her tears, and if only words could have come she would have begged for help, telling her name and her distress
262	metamorphoses	 With letters drawn in the dust with her hoof, instead of words, she traced the sad story of her changed form
263	metamorphoses	 ‘Pity me!’ said her father Inachus, clinging to the groaning heifer’s horns and snow-white neck, ‘Pity me!’ he sighed; ‘Are you really my daughter I searched the wide world for? There was less sadness with you lost than found! Without speech, you do not answer in words to mine, only heave deep sighs from your breast, and all you can do is low in reply to me
264	metamorphoses	 Unknowingly I was arranging marriage and a marriage-bed for you, hoping for a son-in-law first and then grandchildren
265	metamorphoses	 Now you must find a mate from the herd, and from the herd get you a son
266	metamorphoses	 I am not allowed by dying to end such sorrow; it is hard to be a god, the door of death closed to me, my grief goes on immortal for ever
267	metamorphoses	’ As he mourned, Argus with his star-like eyes drove her to distant pastures, dragging her out of her father’s arms
268	metamorphoses	 There, sitting at a distance he occupied a high peak of the mountain, where resting he could keep a watch on every side
269	metamorphoses	Now the king of the gods can no longer stand Phoronis’s great sufferings, and he calls his son, born of the shining Pleiad, and orders him to kill Argus
270	metamorphoses	 Mercury, quickly puts on his winged sandals, takes his sleep-inducing wand in his divine hand, and sets his cap on his head
271	metamorphoses	 Dressed like this the son of Jupiter touches down on the earth from his father’s stronghold
272	metamorphoses	 There, he takes off his cap, and doffs his wings, only keeping his wand
273	metamorphoses	 Taking this, disguised as a shepherd, he drives she-goats, stolen on the way, through solitary lanes, and plays his reed pipe as he goes
274	metamorphoses	 Juno’s guard is captivated by this new sound
275	metamorphoses	 ‘You there, whoever you are’ Argus calls ‘you could sit here beside me on this rock; there’s no better grass elsewhere for your flock, and you can see that the shade is fine for shepherds
276	metamorphoses	"’
"
277	metamorphoses	The descendant of Atlas sits down, and passes the day in conversation, talking of many things, and playing on his reed pipe, trying to conquer those watching eyes
278	metamorphoses	 Argus however fights to overcome gentle sleep, and though he allows some of his eyes to close, the rest stay vigilant
279	metamorphoses	 He even asks, since the reed pipe has only just been invented, how it was invented
280	metamorphoses	So the god explained ‘On Arcadia’s cold mountain slopes among the wood nymphs, the hamadryads, of Mount Nonacris, one was the most celebrated: the nymphs called her Syrinx
281	metamorphoses	 She had often escaped from the satyrs chasing her, and from others of the demi-gods that live in shadowy woods and fertile fields
282	metamorphoses	 But she followed the worship of the Ortygian goddess in staying virgin
283	metamorphoses	 Her dress caught up like Diana she deceives the eye, and could be mistaken for Leto’s daughter, except that her bow is of horn, and the other’s is of gold
284	metamorphoses	 Even so she is deceptive
285	metamorphoses	 Pan, whose head is crowned with a wreath of sharp pine shoots, saw her, coming from Mount Lycaeus, and spoke to her
286	metamorphoses	’ Now Mercury still had to relate what Pan said, and how the nymph, despising his entreaties, ran through the wilds till she came to the calm waters of sandy Ladon; and how when the river stopped her flight she begged her sisters of the stream to change her; and how Pan, when he thought he now had Syrinx, found that instead of the nymph’s body he only held reeds from the marsh; and, while he sighed there, the wind in the reeds, moving, gave out a clear, plaintive sound
287	metamorphoses	 Charmed by this new art and its sweet tones the god said ‘This way of communing with you is still left to me
288	metamorphoses	’ So unequal lengths of reed, joined together with wax, preserved the girl’s name
289	metamorphoses	About to tell all this, Cyllenian Mercury saw that every eye had succumbed and their light was lost in sleep
290	metamorphoses	 Quickly he stops speaking and deepens their rest, caressing those drowsy eyes with touches of his magic wand
291	metamorphoses	 Then straightaway he strikes the nodding head, where it joins the neck, with his curved sword, and sends it bloody down the rocks, staining the steep cliff
292	metamorphoses	 Argus, you are overthrown, the light of your many eyes is extinguished, and one dark sleeps under so many eyelids
293	metamorphoses	Saturnia took his eyes and set them into the feathers of her own bird, and filled the tail with star-like jewels
294	metamorphoses	 Immediately she blazed with anger, and did not hold back from its consequences
295	metamorphoses	 She set a terrifying Fury in front of the eyes and mind of that ‘slut’ from the Argolis, buried a tormenting restlessness in her breast, and drove her as a fugitive through the world
296	metamorphoses	 You, Nile, put an end to her immeasurable suffering
297	metamorphoses	 When she reached you, she fell forward onto her knees on the riverbank and turning back her long neck with her face upwards, in the only way she could, looked to the sky, and with groans and tears and sad lowing seemed to reproach Jupiter and beg him to end her troubles
298	metamorphoses	 Jupiter threw his arms round his wife’s neck and pleaded for an end to vengeance, saying ‘Do not fear, in future she will never be a source of pain’ and he called the Stygian waters to witness his words
299	metamorphoses	As the goddess grows calmer, Io regains her previous appearance, and becomes what she once was
300	metamorphoses	 The rough hair leaves her body, the horns disappear, the great eyes grow smaller, the gaping mouth shrinks, the shoulders and hands return, and the hooves vanish, each hoof changing back into five nails
301	metamorphoses	 Nothing of the heifer is left except her whiteness
302	metamorphoses	 Able to stand on two feet she raises herself erect and fearing to speak in case she lows like a heifer, timidly attempts long neglected words
303	metamorphoses	Now she is worshipped as a greatly honoured goddess by crowds of linen clad acolytes
304	metamorphoses	 In due time she bore a son, Epaphus, who shared the cities’ temples with his mother, and was believed to have been conceived from mighty Jupiter’s seed
305	metamorphoses	 He had a friend, Phaethon, child of the Sun, equal to him in spirit and years, who once boasted proudly that Phoebus was his father, and refused to concede the claim, which Inachus’s grandson could not accept
306	metamorphoses	 ‘You are mad to believe all your mother says, and you have an inflated image of your father
307	metamorphoses	’ Phaethon reddened but, from shame, repressed his anger, and went to his mother Clymene with Inachus’s reproof
308	metamorphoses	 ‘To sadden you more, mother, I the free, proud, spirit was silent! I am ashamed that such a reproach can be spoken and not answered
309	metamorphoses	 But if I am born at all of divine stock, give me some proof of my high birth, and let me claim my divinity!’ So saying he flung his arms round his mother’s neck, entreating her, by his own and her husband Merops’s life, and by his sisters’ marriages, to reveal to him some true sign of his parentage
310	metamorphoses	Clymene, moved perhaps by Phaethon’s entreaties or more by anger at the words spoken, stretched both arms out to the sky and looking up at the sun’s glow said ‘By that brightness marked out by glittering rays, that sees us and hears us, I swear to you, my son, that you are the child of the Sun; of that being you see; you are the child of he who governs the world; if I lie, may he himself decline to look on me again, and may this be the last light to reach our eyes! It is no great effort for you yourself to find your father’s house
311	metamorphoses	 The place he rises from is near our land
312	metamorphoses	 If you have it in mind to do so, go and ask the sun himself!’ Immediately Phaethon, delighted at his mother’s words, imagining the heavens in his mind, darts off and crosses Ethiopia his people’s land, then India, land of those bathed in radiant fire, and with energy reaches the East
313	metamorphoses	" 
"
314	metamorphoses	The palace of the Sun towered up with raised columns, bright with glittering gold, and gleaming bronze like fire
315	metamorphoses	 Shining ivory crowned the roofs, and the twin doors radiated light from polished silver
316	metamorphoses	 The work of art was finer than the material: on the doors Mulciber had engraved the waters that surround the earth’s centre, the earthly globe, and the overarching sky
317	metamorphoses	 The dark blue sea contains the gods, melodious Triton, shifting Proteus, Aegaeon crushing two huge whales together, his arms across their backs, and Doris with her daughters, some seen swimming, some sitting on rocks drying their sea-green hair, some riding the backs of fish
318	metamorphoses	 They are neither all alike, nor all different, just as sisters should be
319	metamorphoses	 The land shows men and towns, woods and creatures, rivers and nymphs and other rural gods
320	metamorphoses	 Above them was an image of the glowing sky, with six signs of the zodiac on the right hand door and the same number on the left
321	metamorphoses	As soon as Clymene’s son had climbed the steep path there, and entered the house of this parent of whose relationship to himself he was uncertain, he immediately made his way into his father’s presence, but stopped some way off, unable to bear his light too close
322	metamorphoses	 Wearing a purple robe, Phoebus sat on a throne shining with bright emeralds
323	metamorphoses	 To right and left stood the Day, Month, and Year, the Century and the equally spaced Hours
324	metamorphoses	 Young Spring stood there circled with a crown of flowers, naked Summer wore a garland of ears of corn, Autumn was stained by the trodden grapes, and icy Winter had white, bristling hair
325	metamorphoses	The Sun, seated in the middle of them, looked at the boy, who was fearful of the strangeness of it all, with eyes that see everything, and said ‘What reason brings you here? What do you look for on these heights, Phaethon, son that no father need deny?’ Phaethon replied ‘Universal light of the great world, Phoebus, father, if you let me use that name, if Clymene is not hiding some fault behind false pretence, give me proof father, so they will believe I am your true offspring, and take away this uncertainty from my mind!’ He spoke, and his father removed the crown of glittering rays from his head and ordered him to come nearer
326	metamorphoses	 Embracing him, he said ‘It is not to be denied you are worthy to be mine, and Clymene has told you the truth of your birth
327	metamorphoses	 So that you can banish doubt, ask for any favour, so that I can grant it to you
328	metamorphoses	 May the Stygian lake, that my eyes have never seen, by which the gods swear, witness my promise
329	metamorphoses	’ Hardly had he settled back properly in his seat when the boy asked for his father’s chariot and the right to control his wing-footed horses for a day
330	metamorphoses	His father regretted his oath
331	metamorphoses	 Three times, and then a fourth, shaking his bright head, he said ‘Your words show mine were rash; if only it were right to retract my promise! I confess my boy I would only refuse you this one thing
332	metamorphoses	 It is right to dissuade you
333	metamorphoses	 What you want is unsafe
334	metamorphoses	 Phaethon you ask too great a favour, and one that is unfitting for your strength and boyish years
335	metamorphoses	 Your fate is mortal: it is not mortal what you ask
336	metamorphoses	 Unknowingly you aspire to more than the gods can share
337	metamorphoses	 Though each deity can please themselves, within what is allowed, no one except myself has the power to occupy the chariot of fire
338	metamorphoses	" Even the lord of mighty Olympus, who hurls terrifying lightning-bolts from his right hand, cannot drive this team, and who is greater than Jupiter?’
"
339	metamorphoses	‘The first part of the track is steep, and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb
340	metamorphoses	 In mid-heaven it is highest, where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me, and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear
341	metamorphoses	 The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control
342	metamorphoses	 Then even Tethys herself, who receives me in her submissive waves, is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong
343	metamorphoses	 Moreover the rushing sky is constantly turning, and drags along the remote stars, and whirls them in rapid orbits
344	metamorphoses	 I move the opposite way, and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things, and I ride contrary to its swift rotation
345	metamorphoses	 Suppose you are given the chariot
346	metamorphoses	 What will you do? Will you be able to counter the turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts
347	metamorphoses	 The way runs through ambush, and apparitions of wild beasts! Even if you keep your course, and do not steer awry, you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull, Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer, raging Leo and the Lion’s jaw, Scorpio’s cruel pincers sweeping out to encircle you from one side, and Cancer’s crab-claws reaching out from the other
348	metamorphoses	 You will not easily rule those proud horses, breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests
349	metamorphoses	 They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot, and their necks resist the reins
350	metamorphoses	" Beware my boy, that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you, while something can still be done to set right your request!’
"
351	metamorphoses	‘No doubt, since you ask for a certain sign to give you confidence in being born of my blood, I give you that sure sign by fearing for you, and show myself a father by fatherly anxiety
352	metamorphoses	 Look at me
353	metamorphoses	 If only you could look into my heart, and see a father’s concern from within! Finally, look around you, at the riches the world holds, and ask for anything from all of the good things in earth, sea, and sky
354	metamorphoses	 I can refuse you nothing
355	metamorphoses	 Only this one thing I take exception to, which would truly be a punishment and not an honour
356	metamorphoses	" Phaethon, you ask for punishment as your reward! Why do you unknowingly throw your coaxing arms around my neck? Have no doubt! Whatever you ask will be given, I have sworn it by the Stygian streams, but make a wiser choice!’
"
357	metamorphoses	The warning ended, but Phaethon still rejected his words, and pressed his purpose, blazing with desire to drive the chariot
358	metamorphoses	 So, as he had the right, his father led the youth to the high chariot, Vulcan’s work
359	metamorphoses	 It had an axle of gold, and a gold chariot pole, wheels with golden rims, and circles of silver spokes
360	metamorphoses	 Along the yoke chrysolites and gemstones, set in order, glowed with brilliance reflecting Phoebus’s own light
361	metamorphoses	Now while brave Phaethon is gazing in wonder at the workmanship, see, Aurora, awake in the glowing east, opens wide her bright doors, and her rose-filled courts
362	metamorphoses	 The stars, whose ranks are shepherded by Lucifer the morning star, vanish, and he, last of all, leaves his station in the sky
363	metamorphoses	When Titan saw his setting, as the earth and skies were reddening, and just as the crescent of the vanishing moon faded, he ordered the swift Hours to yoke his horses
364	metamorphoses	 The goddesses quickly obeyed his command, and led the team, sated with ambrosial food and breathing fire, out of the tall stables, and put on their ringing harness
365	metamorphoses	 Then the father rubbed his son’s face with a sacred ointment, and made it proof against consuming flames, and placed his rays amongst his hair, and foreseeing tragedy, and fetching up sighs from his troubled heart, said ‘If you can at least obey your father’s promptings, spare the whip, boy, and rein them in more strongly! They run swiftly of their own accord
366	metamorphoses	 It is a hard task to check their eagerness
367	metamorphoses	 And do not please yourself, taking a path straight through the five zones of heaven! The track runs obliquely in a wide curve, and bounded by the three central regions, avoids the southern pole and the Arctic north
368	metamorphoses	 This is your road, you will clearly see my wheel-marks, and so that heaven and earth receive equal warmth, do not sink down too far or heave the chariot into the upper air! Too high and you will scorch the roof of heaven: too low, the earth
369	metamorphoses	 The middle way is safest
370	metamorphoses	Nor must you swerve too far right towards writhing Serpens, nor lead your wheels too far left towards sunken Ara
371	metamorphoses	 Hold your way between them! I leave the rest to Fortune, I pray she helps you, and takes better care of you than you do yourself
372	metamorphoses	 While I have been speaking, dewy night has touched her limit on Hesperus’s far western shore
373	metamorphoses	 We have no time for freedom! We are needed: Aurora, the dawn, shines, and the shadows are gone
374	metamorphoses	" Seize the reins in your hand, or if your mind can be changed, take my counsel, do not take my horses! While you can, while you still stand on solid ground, before unknowingly you take to the chariot you have unluckily chosen, let me light the world, while you watch in safety!
"
375	metamorphoses	The boy has already taken possession of the fleet chariot, and stands proudly, and joyfully, takes the light reins in his hands, and thanks his unwilling father
376	metamorphoses	Meanwhile the sun’s swift horses, Pyroïs, Eoüs, Aethon, and the fourth, Phlegon, fill the air with fiery whinnying, and strike the bars with their hooves
377	metamorphoses	 When Tethys, ignorant of her grandson’s fate, pushed back the gate, and gave them access to the wide heavens, rushing out, they tore through the mists in the way with their hooves and, lifted by their wings, overtook the East winds rising from the same region
378	metamorphoses	 But the weight was lighter than the horses of the Sun could feel, and the yoke was free of its accustomed load
379	metamorphoses	 Just as curved-sided boats rock in the waves without their proper ballast, and being too light are unstable at sea, so the chariot, free of its usual burden, leaps in the air and rushes into the heights as though it were empty
380	metamorphoses	As soon as they feel this the team of four run wild and leave the beaten track, no longer running in their pre-ordained course
381	metamorphoses	 He was terrified, unable to handle the reins entrusted to him, not knowing where the track was, nor, if he had known, how to control the team
382	metamorphoses	 Then for the first time the chill stars of the Great and Little Bears, grew hot, and tried in vain to douse themselves in forbidden waters
383	metamorphoses	 And the Dragon, Draco, that is nearest to the frozen pole, never formidable before and sluggish with the cold, now glowed with heat, and took to seething with new fury
384	metamorphoses	 They say that you Bootës also fled in confusion, slow as you are and hampered by the Plough
385	metamorphoses	When the unlucky Phaethon looked down from the heights of the sky at the earth far, far below he grew pale and his knees quaked with sudden fear, and his eyes were robbed of shadow by the excess light
386	metamorphoses	 Now he would rather he had never touched his father’s horses, and regrets knowing his true parentage and possessing what he asked for
387	metamorphoses	 Now he wants only to be called Merops’s son, as he is driven along like a ship in a northern gale, whose master lets go the ropes, and leaves her to prayer and the gods
388	metamorphoses	 What can he do? Much of the sky is now behind his back, but more is before his eyes
389	metamorphoses	 Measuring both in his mind, he looks ahead to the west he is not fated to reach and at times back to the east
390	metamorphoses	 Dazed he is ignorant how to act, and can neither grasp the reins nor has the power to loose them, nor can he change course by calling the horses by name
391	metamorphoses	 Also, alarmed, he sees the marvellous forms of huge creatures everywhere in the glowing sky
392	metamorphoses	 There is a place where Scorpio bends his pincers in twin arcs, and, with his tail and his curving arms stretched out to both sides, spreads his body and limbs over two star signs
393	metamorphoses	 When the boy saw this monster drenched with black and poisonous venom threatening to wound him with its arched sting, robbed of his wits by chilling horror, he dropped the reins
394	metamorphoses	When the horses feel the reins lying across their backs, after he has thrown them down, they veer off course and run unchecked through unknown regions of the air
395	metamorphoses	 Wherever their momentum takes them there they run, lawlessly, striking against the fixed stars in deep space and hurrying the chariot along remote tracks
396	metamorphoses	 Now they climb to the heights of heaven, now rush headlong down its precipitous slope, sweeping a course nearer to the earth
397	metamorphoses	 The Moon, amazed, sees her brother’s horses running below her own, and the boiling clouds smoke
398	metamorphoses	 The earth bursts into flame, in the highest regions first, opens in deep fissures and all its moisture dries up
399	metamorphoses	 The meadows turn white, the trees are consumed with all their leaves, and the scorched corn makes its own destruction
400	metamorphoses	 But I am bemoaning the lesser things
401	metamorphoses	 Great cities are destroyed with all their walls, and the flames reduce whole nations with all their peoples to ashes
402	metamorphoses	 The woodlands burn, with the hills
403	metamorphoses	 Mount Athos is on fire, Cilician Taurus, Tmolus, Oete and Ida, dry now once covered with fountains, and Helicon home of the Muses, and Haemus not yet linked with King Oeagrius’s name
404	metamorphoses	 Etna blazes with immense redoubled flames, the twin peaks of Parnassus, Eryx, Cynthus, Othrys, Rhodope fated at last to lose its snow, Mimas and Dindyma, Mycale and Cithaeron, ancient in rites
405	metamorphoses	 Its chilly climate cannot save Scythia
406	metamorphoses	 The Caucasus burn, and Ossa along with Pindus, and Olympos greater than either, and the lofty Alps and cloud-capped Apennines
407	metamorphoses	Then, truly, Phaethon sees the whole earth on fire
408	metamorphoses	 He cannot bear the violent heat, and he breathes the air as if from a deep furnace
409	metamorphoses	 He feels his chariot glowing white
410	metamorphoses	 He can no longer stand the ash and sparks flung out, and is enveloped in dense, hot smoke
411	metamorphoses	 He does not know where he is, or where he is going, swept along by the will of the winged horses
412	metamorphoses	It was then, so they believe, that the Ethiopians acquired their dark colour, since the blood was drawn to the surface of their bodies
413	metamorphoses	 Then Libya became a desert, the heat drying up her moisture
414	metamorphoses	 Then the nymphs with dishevelled hair wept bitterly for their lakes and fountains
415	metamorphoses	 Boeotia searches for Dirce’s rills, Argos for Amymone’s fountain, Corinth for the Pirenian spring
416	metamorphoses	 Nor are the rivers safe because of their wide banks
417	metamorphoses	 The Don turns to steam in mid-water, and old Peneus, and Mysian Caicus and swift-flowing Ismenus, Arcadian Erymanthus, Xanthus destined to burn again, golden Lycormas and Maeander playing in its watery curves, Thracian Melas and Laconian Eurotas
418	metamorphoses	 Babylonian Euphrates burns
419	metamorphoses	 Orontes burns and quick Thermodon, Ganges, Phasis, and Danube
420	metamorphoses	 Alpheus boils
421	metamorphoses	 Spercheos’s banks are on fire
422	metamorphoses	 The gold that the River Tagus carries is molten with the fires, and the swans for whose singing Maeonia’s riverbanks are famous, are scorched in Caÿster’s midst
423	metamorphoses	 The Nile fled in terror to the ends of the earth, and hid its head that remains hidden
424	metamorphoses	 Its seven mouths are empty and dust-filled, seven channels without a stream
425	metamorphoses	The same fate parches the Thracian rivers, Hebrus and Strymon, and the western rivers, Rhine, Rhone, Po and the Tiber who had been promised universal power
426	metamorphoses	 Everywhere the ground breaks apart, light penetrates through the cracks down into Tartarus, and terrifies the king of the underworld and his queen
427	metamorphoses	 The sea contracts and what was a moment ago wide sea is a parched expanse of sand
428	metamorphoses	 Mountains emerge from the water, and add to the scattered Cyclades
429	metamorphoses	 The fish dive deep, and the dolphins no longer dare to rise arcing above the water, as they have done, into the air
430	metamorphoses	 The lifeless bodies of seals float face upwards on the deep
431	metamorphoses	 They even say that Nereus himself, and Doris and her daughters drifted through warm caves
432	metamorphoses	 Three times Neptune tried to lift his fierce face and arms above the waters
433	metamorphoses	 Three times he could not endure the burning air
434	metamorphoses	Nevertheless, kindly Earth, surrounded as she was by sea, between the open waters and the dwindling streams that had buried themselves in their mother’s dark womb, lifted her smothered face
435	metamorphoses	 Putting her hand to her brow, and shaking everything with her mighty tremors, she sank back a little lower than she used to be, and spoke in a faint voice ‘If this pleases you, if I have deserved it, O king of the gods, why delay your lightning bolts? If it is right for me to die through the power of fire, let me die by your fire and let the doer of it lessen the pain of the deed! I can hardly open my lips to say these words’ (the heat was choking her)
436	metamorphoses	" Look at my scorched hair and the ashes in my eyes, the ashes over my face! Is this the honour and reward you give me for my fruitfulness and service, for carrying wounds from the curved plough and the hoe, for being worked throughout the year, providing herbage and tender grazing for the flocks, produce for the human race and incense to minister to you gods?
"
437	metamorphoses	"Even if you find me deserving of ruin, what have the waves done, why does your brother deserve this? Why are the waters that were his share by lot diminished and so much further from the sky? If neither regard for me or for your brother moves you pity at least your own heavens! Look around you on either side: both the poles are steaming! If the fire should melt them, your own palace will fall! Atlas himself is suffering, and can barely hold up the white-hot sky on his shoulders! If the sea and the land and the kingdom of the heavens are destroyed, we are lost in ancient chaos! Save whatever is left from the flames, and think of our common interest!’
"
438	metamorphoses	So the Earth spoke, and unable to tolerate the heat any longer or speak any further, she withdrew her face into her depths closer to the caverns of the dead
439	metamorphoses	 But the all-powerful father of the gods climbs to the highest summit of heaven, from where he spreads his clouds over the wide earth, from where he moves the thunder and hurls his quivering lightning bolts, calling on the gods, especially on him who had handed over the sun chariot, to witness that, unless he himself helps, the whole world will be overtaken by a ruinous fate
440	metamorphoses	 Now he has no clouds to cover the earth, or rain to shower from the sky
441	metamorphoses	 He thundered, and balancing a lightning bolt in his right hand threw it from eye-level at the charioteer, removing him, at the same moment, from the chariot and from life, extinguishing fire with fierce fire
442	metamorphoses	 Thrown into confusion the horses, lurching in different directions, wrench their necks from the yoke and throw off the broken harness
443	metamorphoses	 Here the reins lie, there the axle torn from the pole, there the spokes of shattered wheels, and the fragments of the wrecked chariot are flung far and wide
444	metamorphoses	But Phaethon, flames ravaging his glowing hair, is hurled headlong, leaving a long trail in the air, as sometimes a star does in the clear sky, appearing to fall although it does not fall
445	metamorphoses	 Far from his own country, in a distant part of the world, the river god Eridanus takes him from the air, and bathes his smoke-blackened face
446	metamorphoses	" There the Italian nymphs consign his body, still smoking from that triple-forked flame, to the earth, and they also carve a verse in the rock:
"
447	metamorphoses	"HERE PHAETHON LIES WHO THE SUN’S JOURNEY MADE
"
448	metamorphoses	"DARED ALL THOUGH HE BY WEAKNESS WAS BETRAYED
"
449	metamorphoses	Now the father, pitiful, ill with grief, hid his face, and, if we can believe it, a whole day went by without the sun
450	metamorphoses	 But the fires gave light, so there was something beneficial amongst all that evil
451	metamorphoses	 But Clymene, having uttered whatever can be uttered at such misfortune, grieving and frantic and tearing her breast, wandered over the whole earth first looking for her son’s limbs, and then failing that his bones
452	metamorphoses	 She found his bones already buried however, beside the riverbank in a foreign country
453	metamorphoses	 Falling to the ground she bathed with tears the name she could read on the cold stone and warmed it against her naked breast
454	metamorphoses	 The Heliads, her daughters and the Sun’s, cry no less, and offer their empty tribute of tears to the dead, and, beating their breasts with their hands, they call for their brother night and day, and lie down on his tomb, though he cannot hear their pitiful sighs
455	metamorphoses	Four times the moon had joined her crescent horns to form her bright disc
456	metamorphoses	 They by habit, since use creates habit, devoted themselves to mourning
457	metamorphoses	 Then Phaethüsa, the eldest sister, when she tried to throw herself to the ground, complained that her ankles had stiffened, and when radiant Lampetia tried to come near her she was suddenly rooted to the spot
458	metamorphoses	 A third sister attempting to tear at her hair pulled out leaves
459	metamorphoses	 One cried out in pain that her legs were sheathed in wood, another that her arms had become long branches
460	metamorphoses	 While they wondered at this, bark closed round their thighs and by degrees over their waists, breasts, shoulders, and hands, and all that was left free were their mouths calling for their mother
461	metamorphoses	 What can their mother do but go here and there as the impulse takes her, pressing her lips to theirs where she can? It is no good
462	metamorphoses	 She tries to pull the bark from their bodies and break off new branches with her hands, but drops of blood are left behind like wounds
463	metamorphoses	 ‘Stop, mother, please’ cries out whichever one she hurts, ‘Please stop: It is my body in the tree you are tearing
464	metamorphoses	 Now, farewell
465	metamorphoses	’ and the bark closed over her with her last words
466	metamorphoses	 Their tears still flow, and hardened by the sun, fall as amber from the virgin branches, to be taken by the bright river and sent onwards to adorn Roman brides
467	metamorphoses	Cycnus, the son of Sthenelus witnessed this marvel, who though he was kin to you Phaethon, through his mother, was closer still in love
468	metamorphoses	 Now, though he had ruled the people and great cities of Liguria, he left his kingdom, and filled Eridanus’s green banks and streams, and the woods the sisters had become part of, with his grief
469	metamorphoses	 As he did so his voice vanished and white feathers hid his hair, his long neck stretched out from his body, his reddened fingers became webbed, wings covered his sides, and a rounded beak his mouth
470	metamorphoses	 So Cycnus became a new kind of bird, the swan
471	metamorphoses	 But he had no faith in Jupiter and the heavens, remembering the lightning bolt the god in his severity had hurled
472	metamorphoses	 He looked for standing water, and open lakes hating fire, choosing to live in floods rather than flames
473	metamorphoses	Meanwhile Phaethon’s father, mourning and without his accustomed brightness, as if in eclipse, hated the light, himself and the day
474	metamorphoses	 He gave his mind over to grief, and to grief added his anger, and refused to provide his service to the earth
475	metamorphoses	 ‘Enough’ he says ‘since the beginning, my task has given me no rest and I am weary of work without end and labour without honour! Whoever chooses to can steer the chariot of light! If no one does, and all the gods acknowledge they cannot, let Jupiter himself do it, so that for a while at least, while he tries to take the reins, he must put aside the lightning bolts that leave fathers bereft! Then he will know when he has tried the strength of those horses, with hooves of fire, that the one who failed to rule them well did not deserve to be killed
476	metamorphoses	"’
"
477	metamorphoses	All the gods gather round Sol, as he talks like this, and beg him not to shroud everything with darkness
478	metamorphoses	 Jupiter himself tries to excuse the fire he hurled, adding threats to his entreaties as kings do
479	metamorphoses	 Then Phoebus rounds up his horses, maddened and still trembling with terror, and in pain lashes out at them with goad and whip (really lashes out) reproaching them and blaming them for his son’s death
480	metamorphoses	Now the all-powerful father of the gods circuits the vast walls of heaven and examines them to check if anything has been loosened by the violent fires
481	metamorphoses	 When he sees they are as solid and robust as ever he inspects the earth and the works of humankind
482	metamorphoses	 Arcadia above all is his greatest care
483	metamorphoses	 He restores her fountains and streams, that are still hardly daring to flow, gives grass to the bare earth, leaves to the trees, and makes the scorched forests grow green again
484	metamorphoses	Often, as he came and went, he would stop short at the sight of a girl from Nonacris, feeling the fire take in the very marrow of his bones
485	metamorphoses	 She was not one to spin soft wool or play with her hair
486	metamorphoses	 A clasp fastened her tunic, and a white ribbon held back her loose tresses
487	metamorphoses	 Dressed like this, with a spear or a bow in her hand, she was one of Diana’s companions
488	metamorphoses	 No nymph who roamed Maenalus was dearer to Trivia, goddess of the crossways, than she, Callisto, was
489	metamorphoses	 But no favour lasts long
490	metamorphoses	The sun was high, just path the zenith, when she entered a grove that had been untouched through the years
491	metamorphoses	 Here she took her quiver from her shoulder, unstrung her curved bow, and lay down on the grass, her head resting on her painted quiver
492	metamorphoses	" Jupiter, seeing her there weary and unprotected, said ‘Here, surely, my wife will not see my cunning, or if she does find out it is, oh it is, worth a quarrel!’ Quickly he took on the face and dress of Diana, and said ‘Oh, girl who follows me, where in my domains have you been hunting?’
"
493	metamorphoses	The virgin girl got up from the turf replying ‘Greetings, goddess greater than Jupiter: I say it even though he himself hears it
494	metamorphoses	’ He did hear, and laughed, happy to be judged greater than himself, and gave her kisses unrestrainedly, and not those that virgins give
495	metamorphoses	 When she started to say which woods she had hunted he embraced and prevented her and not without committing a crime
496	metamorphoses	 Face to face with him, as far as a woman could, (I wish you had seen her Juno: you would have been kinder to her) she fought him, but how could a girl win, and who is more powerful than Jove? Victorious, Jupiter made for the furthest reaches of the sky: while to Callisto the grove was odious and the wood seemed knowing
497	metamorphoses	 As she retraced her steps she almost forgot her quiver and its arrows, and the bow she had left hanging
498	metamorphoses	Behold how Diana, with her band of huntresses, approaching from the heights of Maenalus, magnificent from the kill, spies her there, and seeing her calls out
499	metamorphoses	 At the shout she runs, afraid at first in case it is Jupiter disguised, but when she sees the other nymphs come forward she realises there is no trickery and joins their number
500	metamorphoses	 Alas! How hard it is not to show one’s guilt in one’s face! She can scarcely lift her eyes from the ground, not as she used to be, wedded to her goddess’s side or first of the whole company, but is silent and by her blushing shows signs of her shame at being attacked
501	metamorphoses	 Even if she were not herself virgin, Diana could sense her guilt in a thousand ways
502	metamorphoses	 They say all the nymphs could feel it
503	metamorphoses	Nine crescent moons had since grown full when the goddess faint from the chase in her brother’s hot sunlight found a cool grove out of which a murmuring stream ran, winding over fine sand
504	metamorphoses	 She loved the place and tested the water with her foot
505	metamorphoses	 Pleased with this too she said ‘Any witness is far away, let’s bathe our bodies naked in the flowing water
506	metamorphoses	’ The Arcadian girl blushed: all of them took off their clothes: one of them tried to delay: hesitantly the tunic was removed and there her shame was revealed with her naked body
507	metamorphoses	 Terrified she tried to conceal her swollen belly
508	metamorphoses	 Diana cried ‘Go, far away from here: do not pollute the sacred fountain!’ and the Moon-goddess commanded her to leave her band of followers
509	metamorphoses	The great Thunderer’s wife had known about all this for a long time and had held back her severe punishment until the proper time
510	metamorphoses	 Now there was no reason to wait
511	metamorphoses	 The girl had given birth to a boy, Arcas, and that in itself enraged Juno
512	metamorphoses	 When she turned her angry eyes and mind to thought of him she cried out ‘Nothing more was needed, you adulteress, than your fertility, and your marking the insult to me by giving birth, making public my Jupiter’s crime
513	metamorphoses	 You’ll not carry this off safely
514	metamorphoses	 Now, insolent girl, I will take that shape away from you, that pleased you and my husband so much!’ At this she clutched her in front by the hair of her forehead and pulled her face forwards onto the ground
515	metamorphoses	 Callisto stretched out her arms for mercy: those arms began to bristle with coarse black hairs: her hands arched over and changed into curved claws to serve as feet: and her face, that Jupiter had once praised, was disfigured by gaping jaws: and so that her prayers and words of entreaty might not attract him her power of speech was taken from her
516	metamorphoses	 An angry, threatening growl, harsh and terrifying, came from her throat
517	metamorphoses	 Still her former feelings remained intact though she was now a bear
518	metamorphoses	 She showed her misery in continual groaning, raising such hands as she had left to the starry sky, feeling, though she could not speak it, Jupiter’s indifference
519	metamorphoses	 Ah, how often she wandered near the house and fields that had once been her home, not daring to sleep in the lonely woods! Ah, how often she was driven among the rocks by the baying hounds, and the huntress fled in fear from the hunters! Often she hid at the sight of wild beasts forgetting what she was, and though a bear she shuddered at the sight of other bears on the mountains and feared the wolves though her father Lycaon ran with them
520	metamorphoses	And now Arcas, grandson of Lycaon, had reached his fifteenth year ignorant of his parentage
521	metamorphoses	 While he was hunting wild animals, while he was finding suitable glades and penning up the Erymanthian groves with woven nets, he came across his mother, who stood still at sight of Arcas and appeared to know him
522	metamorphoses	 He shrank back from those unmoving eyes gazing at him so fixedly, uncertain what made him afraid, and when she quickly came nearer he was about to pierce her chest with his lethal spear
523	metamorphoses	 All-powerful Jupiter restrained him and in the same moment removed them and the possibility of that wrong, and together, caught up through the void on the winds, he set them in the heavens and made them similar constellations, the Great and Little Bear
524	metamorphoses	Juno was angered when she saw his inamorato shining among the stars, and went down into the waters to white-haired Tethys and old Oceanus to whom the gods often make reverence
525	metamorphoses	 When they asked her the reason for her visit she began ‘You ask me why I, the queen of the gods, have left my home in the heavens to be here? Another has taken my place in the sky! I tell a lie, if you do not see, when night falls and the world darkens, newly exalted stars to wound me, set in the sky, where the remotest and shortest orbit circles the uttermost pole
526	metamorphoses	 Why should anyone wish to avoid wounding Juno or dread my enmity if I only benefit those I harm? Oh what a great achievement! Oh what marvellous powers I have! I stopped her being human and she becomes a goddess! This is the punishment I inflict on the guilty! This is my wonderful sovereignty! Let him take away her animal form and restore her former beauty as he did before with that Argive girl, Io
527	metamorphoses	" Why not divorce Juno, install her in my place, and let Lycaon be his father-in-law? If this contemptible insult to your foster-child moves you, shut out the seven stars of the Bear from your dark blue waters, repulse this constellation set in the heavens as a reward for her defilement, and do not let my rival dip in your pure flood!’
"
528	metamorphoses	The gods of the sea nodded their consent
529	metamorphoses	 Then Saturnia, in her light chariot drawn by painted peacocks, drove up through the clear air
530	metamorphoses	 These peacocks had only recently been painted, when Argus was killed, at the same time that your wings, Corvus, croaking Raven, were suddenly changed to black, though they were white before
531	metamorphoses	 He was once a bird with silver-white plumage, equal to the spotless doves, not inferior to the geese, those saviours of the Capitol with their watchful cries, or the swan, the lover of rivers
532	metamorphoses	 His speech condemned him
533	metamorphoses	 Because of his ready speech he, who was once snow white, was now white’s opposite
534	metamorphoses	Coronis of Larissa was the loveliest girl in all Thessaly
535	metamorphoses	 Certainly she pleased you, god of Delphi
536	metamorphoses	 Well, as long as she was faithful, or not caught out
537	metamorphoses	 But that bird of Phoebus discovered her adultery and, merciless informer, flew straight to his master to reveal the secret crime
538	metamorphoses	 The garrulous Crow followed with flapping wings, wanting to know everything, but when he heard the reason, he said ‘This journey will do you no good: don’t ignore my prophecy! See what I was, see what I am, and search out the justice in it
539	metamorphoses	 Truth was my downfall
540	metamorphoses	"’
"
541	metamorphoses	Once upon a time Pallas hid a child, Erichthonius, born without a human mother, in a box made of Actaean osiers
542	metamorphoses	 She gave this to the three virgin daughters of two-natured Cecrops, who was part human part serpent, and ordered them not to pry into its secret
543	metamorphoses	 Hidden in the light leaves that grew thickly over an elm-tree I set out to watch what they might do
544	metamorphoses	 Two of the girls, Pandrosus and Herse, obeyed without cheating, but the third Aglauros called her sisters cowards and undid the knots with her hand, and inside they found a baby boy with a snake stretched out next to him
545	metamorphoses	 That act I betrayed to the goddess
546	metamorphoses	 And this is the reward I got for it, no longer consecrated to Minerva’s protection, and ranked below the Owl, that night-bird! My punishment should be a warning to all birds not to take risks by speaking out
547	metamorphoses	"’
"
548	metamorphoses	‘And just think, not only had I not asked for her favour, she had sought me out, of her own accord! – Ask Pallas herself: though she is angry, she will not deny it even in anger
549	metamorphoses	 The famous Coroneus was my father, in the land of Phocis (it is said to be well known) and I was a royal virgin and wealthy princes courted me (so do not disparage me)
550	metamorphoses	 But my beauty hurt me
551	metamorphoses	 Once when I was walking slowly as I used to do along the crest of the sands by the shore the sea-god saw me and grew hot
552	metamorphoses	 When his flattering words and entreaties proved a waste of time, he tried force, and chased after me
553	metamorphoses	 I ran, leaving the solid shore behind, tiring myself out uselessly in the soft sand
554	metamorphoses	 Then I called out to gods and men
555	metamorphoses	 No mortal heard my voice, but the virgin goddess feels pity for a virgin and she helped me
556	metamorphoses	 I was stretching out my arms to the sky: those arms began to darken with soft plumage
557	metamorphoses	 I tried to lift my cloak from my shoulders but it had turned to feathers with roots deep in my skin
558	metamorphoses	 I tried to beat my naked breast with my hands but found I had neither hands nor naked breast
559	metamorphoses	I ran, and now the sand did not clog my feet as before but I lifted from the ground, and soon sailed high into the air
560	metamorphoses	 So I became an innocent servant of Minerva
561	metamorphoses	 But what use was that to me if Nyctimene, who was turned into an Owl for her dreadful sins, has usurped my place of honour? Or have you not heard the story all Lesbos knows well, how Nyctimene desecrated her father’s bed? Though she is now a bird she is conscious of guilt at her crime and flees from human sight and the light, and hides her shame in darkness, and is driven from the whole sky by all the birds
562	metamorphoses	"’
"
563	metamorphoses	To all this, the Raven replied ‘I pray any evil be on your own head
564	metamorphoses	 I spurn empty prophecies’ and, completing the journey he had started, he told his master he had seen Coronis lying beside a Thessalian youth
565	metamorphoses	 The laurel fell from the lover’s head on hearing of the charge, his expression and colour and the tone of his lyre changed, and his mind boiled with growing anger
566	metamorphoses	 He seized his usual weapons, strung his bow bending it by the tips, and, with his unerring arrow, pierced the breast that had so often been close to his own
567	metamorphoses	 She groaned at the wound, and as the arrow was drawn out her white limbs were drenched with scarlet blood and she cried out ‘Oh Phoebus it was in your power to have punished me, but to have let me give birth first: now two will die in one
568	metamorphoses	’ She spoke, and then her life flowed out with her blood
569	metamorphoses	 A deathly cold stole over her body, emptied of being
570	metamorphoses	Alas! Too late the lover repents of his cruel act, and hates himself for listening to the tale that has so angered him
571	metamorphoses	 He hates the bird that has compelled him to know of the fault that brought him pain
572	metamorphoses	 He hates the bow, his hand, and the hastily fired arrow as well as that hand
573	metamorphoses	 He cradles the fallen girl and attempts to overcome fate with his healing powers
574	metamorphoses	 It is too late, and he tries his arts in vain
575	metamorphoses	 Later, when all efforts had failed, seeing the funeral pyre prepared to consume her body, then indeed the god groaned from the depths of his heart (since the faces of the heavenly gods cannot be touched by tears), groans no different from those of a young bullock, seeing the hammer poised at the slaughterer’s right ear, crash down on the hollow forehead of a suckling calf
576	metamorphoses	Even though she cannot know of it, the god pours fragrant incense over her breast, and embraces her body, and unjustly, performs the just rites
577	metamorphoses	 He could not let a child of Phoebus be destroyed in the same ruin, and he tore his son, Aesculapius, from its mother’s womb and from the flames, and carried him to the cave of Chiron the Centaur, who was half man and half horse
578	metamorphoses	 But he stopped the Raven, who had hoped for a reward for telling the truth, from living among the white birds
579	metamorphoses	The semi-human was pleased with this foster-child of divine origin, glad at the honour it brought him, when his daughter suddenly appeared, her shoulders covered with her long red hair, whom the nymph Chariclo called Ocyrhoë, having given birth to her on the banks of that swift stream
580	metamorphoses	 She was not content merely to have learned her father’s arts, she also chanted the secrets of the Fates
581	metamorphoses	So when she felt the prophetic frenzy in her mind, and was on fire with the god enclosed in her breast, she looked at the infant boy and cried out ‘Grow and thrive, child, healer of all the world! Human beings will often be in your debt, and you will have the right to restore the dead
582	metamorphoses	 But if ever it is done regardless of the god’s displeasure you will be stopped, by the flame of your grandfather’s lightning bolt, from doing so again
583	metamorphoses	 From a god you will turn to a bloodless corpse, and then to a god who was a corpse, and so twice renew your fate
584	metamorphoses	You also, dear father, now immortal, and created by the law of your birth to live on through all the ages, will long for death, when you are tormented by the terrible venom of the Serpent, Hydra, absorbed through your wounded limbs
585	metamorphoses	 But at last the gods will give you the power to die, and the Three Goddesses will sever the thread
586	metamorphoses	’ Other prophecies remained to tell: but she sighed deeply, distressed by the tears welling from her eyes, and cried ‘The Fates prevent me, and forbid me further speech
587	metamorphoses	 My throat is constricted
588	metamorphoses	 These arts are not worth the cost if they incur the gods’ anger against me
589	metamorphoses	 Better not to know the future! Now I see my human shape being taken away, now grass contents me for food, now my impulse is to race over the wide fields
590	metamorphoses	 I am changing to a mare, the form of my kindred
591	metamorphoses	 But why am I completely so? Surely my father is still half human
592	metamorphoses	’ Even as she spoke, the last part of her complaint was hard to understand and her words were troubled
593	metamorphoses	 Soon they seemed neither words nor a horse’s neighs, but the imitation of a horse
594	metamorphoses	 In a little while she gave out clear whinnying noises, and her arms moved in the grass
595	metamorphoses	 Then her fingers came together and one thin solid hoof of horn joined her five fingernails
596	metamorphoses	 Her head and the length of her neck extended, the greater part of her long gown became a tail, and the loose hair thrown over her neck hung down as a mane on her right shoulder
597	metamorphoses	 Now she was altered in both voice and features, and from this marvellous happening she gained a new name
598	metamorphoses	The demi-god, son of Philyra, wept, and called to you for help in vain, O lord of Delphi
599	metamorphoses	 You could not re-call mighty Jupiter’s command, and, if you had been able to, you were not there
600	metamorphoses	 You lived in Elis and the Messenian lands
601	metamorphoses	 That was the time when you wore a shepherd’s cloak, carried a wooden crook in your left hand, and in the other a pipe of seven disparate reeds
602	metamorphoses	 And while your thoughts were of love, while you played sweetly on your pipe, your cattle, unguarded, strayed, it is said, into the Pylian fields
603	metamorphoses	 There, Mercury Atlantiades, son of Maia, saw them and by his arts drove them into the woods and hid them there
604	metamorphoses	 Nobody saw the theft except one old man, well known in that country, whom they called Battus
605	metamorphoses	 He served as guardian of a herd of pedigree mares, for a wealthy man Neleus, in the rich meadows and woodland pastures
606	metamorphoses	 Mercury found him and drawing him away with coaxing hand said ‘Whoever you are, friend, if anyone asks if you have seen any of these cattle, say no, and so that the favour is not un-rewarded, you can take a shining heifer for your prize!’ and he handed it over
607	metamorphoses	The fellow accepted it and replied ‘Go on, you are safe
608	metamorphoses	 That stone would betray you quicker than I’ and he even pointed out a stone
609	metamorphoses	 Jupiter’s son pretended to go, but soon returned in another form and voice, saying ‘Countryman, if you have seen any cattle going this way, help me, and don’t be silent, they were stolen! I’ll give you a reward of a bull and its heifer
610	metamorphoses	’ The old man, hearing the prize doubled said ‘They were at the foot of the mountain, and at the foot of the mountain is where they are
611	metamorphoses	’ Atlantiades laughed
612	metamorphoses	 ‘Would you betray me to myself, you rascal? Betray me to myself?’ And he turned that deceitful body to solid flint, that even now is called ‘touchstone’, the ‘informer’, and unjustly the old disgrace clings to the stone
613	metamorphoses	" 
"
614	metamorphoses	 The god with the caduceus lifted upwards on his paired wings and as he flew looked down on the Munychian fields, the land that Minerva loves, and on the groves of the cultured Lyceum
615	metamorphoses	 That day happened to be a festival of Pallas, when, by tradition, innocent girls carried the sacred mysteries to her temple, in flower-wreathed baskets, on their heads
616	metamorphoses	 The winged god saw them returning and flew towards them, not directly but in a curving flight, as a swift kite, spying out the sacrificial entrails, wheels above, still fearful of the priests crowding round the victim, but afraid to fly further off, circling eagerly on tilted wings over its hoped-for prey
617	metamorphoses	 So agile Mercury slanted in flight over the Athenian hill, spiraling on the same winds
618	metamorphoses	 As Lucifer shines more brightly than the other stars, and golden Phoebe outshines Lucifer, so Herse was pre-eminent among the virgin girls, the glory of that procession of her comrades
619	metamorphoses	 Jupiter’s son was astonished at her beauty, and, even though he hung in the air, he was inflamed
620	metamorphoses	 Just as when a lead shot is flung from a Balearic sling it flies on and becomes red hot, discovering heat in the clouds it did not have before
621	metamorphoses	 He altered course, leaving the sky, and heading towards earth, without disguising himself, he was so confident of his own looks
622	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless, even though it is so, he takes care to enhance them
623	metamorphoses	 He smoothes his hair, and arranges his robe to hang neatly so that the golden hem will show, and has his polished wand, that induces or drives away sleep, in his right hand, and his winged sandals gleaming on his trim feet
624	metamorphoses	There were three rooms deep inside the house, decorated with tortoiseshell and ivory
625	metamorphoses	 Pandrosus had the right hand room, Aglauros the left, and Herse the room between
626	metamorphoses	 She of the left hand room first saw the god’s approach and dared to ask his name and the reason for his visit
627	metamorphoses	 The grandson of Atlas and Pleione replied ‘I am the one who carries my father’s messages through the air
628	metamorphoses	 My father is Jupiter himself
629	metamorphoses	 I won’t hide the reason
630	metamorphoses	 Only be loyal to your sister and consent to be called my child’s aunt
631	metamorphoses	 Herse is the reason I am here
632	metamorphoses	 I beg you to help a lover
633	metamorphoses	’ Aglauros looked at him with the same rapacious eyes with which she had lately looked into golden Minerva’s hidden secret, and she demanded a heavy weight of gold for her services
634	metamorphoses	 Meanwhile she compelled him to leave the house
635	metamorphoses	Now the warrior goddess turned angry eyes on her, and in her emotion drew breath from deep inside so that both her strong breast and the aegis that covered her breast shook with it
636	metamorphoses	 She remembered that this girl had revealed her secret with profane hands, when, breaking her command, she had seen Erichthonius, son of Vulcan, the Lemnian, the child born without a mother
637	metamorphoses	 Now the girl would be dear to the god, and to her own sister, and rich with the gold she acquired, demanded by her greed
638	metamorphoses	 Straightaway the goddess made for Envy’s house that is filthy with dark decay
639	metamorphoses	 Her cave was hidden deep among valleys, sunless and inaccessible to the winds, a melancholy place and filled with a numbing cold
640	metamorphoses	 Fire is always absent, and fog always fills it
641	metamorphoses	When the feared war goddess came there, she stood outside the cave, since she had no right to enter the place, and struck the doors with the butt of her spear
642	metamorphoses	 With the blow they flew open
643	metamorphoses	 Envy could be seen, eating vipers’ meat that fed her venom, and at the sight the goddess averted her eyes
644	metamorphoses	 But the other got up slowly from the ground, leaving the half-eaten snake flesh, and came forward with sluggish steps
645	metamorphoses	 When she saw the goddess dressed in her armour and her beauty, she moaned and frowned as she sighed
646	metamorphoses	 Pallor spreads over her face, and all her body shrivels
647	metamorphoses	Her sight is skewed, her teeth are livid with decay, her breast is green with bile, and her tongue is suffused with venom
648	metamorphoses	 She only smiles at the sight of suffering
649	metamorphoses	 She never sleeps, excited by watchful cares
650	metamorphoses	 She finds men’s successes disagreeable, and pines away at the sight
651	metamorphoses	 She gnaws and being gnawed is also her own punishment
652	metamorphoses	 Though she hated her so, nevertheless Tritonia spoke briefly to her
653	metamorphoses	 ‘Poison one of Cecrops’s daughters with your venom
654	metamorphoses	 That is the task
655	metamorphoses	 Aglauros is the one
656	metamorphoses	’ Without more words she fled and with a thrust of her spear sprang from the earth
657	metamorphoses	Envy, squinting at her as she flees, gives out low mutterings, sorry to think of Minerva’s coming success
658	metamorphoses	 She takes her staff bound with strands of briar, and sets out, shrouded in gloomy clouds
659	metamorphoses	 Wherever she passes she tramples the flower-filled fields, withers the grass, blasts the highest treetops and poisons homes, cities and peoples with her breath
660	metamorphoses	 At last she sees Athens, Tritonia’s city, flourishing with arts and riches and leisured peace
661	metamorphoses	 She can hardly hold back her tears because she sees nothing tearful
662	metamorphoses	 But after entering the chamber of Cecrops’s daughter, she carried out her command and touched her breast with a hand tinted with darkness and filled her heart with sharp thorns
663	metamorphoses	 Then she breathed poisonous, destructive breath into her and spread black venom through her bones and the inside of her lungs
664	metamorphoses	 And so that the cause for pain might never be far away she placed Aglauros’s sister before her eyes, in imagination, her sister’s fortunate marriage, and the beauty of the god, magnifying it all
665	metamorphoses	Cecrops’s daughter, tormented by this, is eaten by secret agony, and troubled by night and troubled by light, she moans and wastes away in slow, wretched decay, like ice eroded by the fitful sun
666	metamorphoses	 She is consumed by envy of Herses’ happiness; just as when a fire is lit under a pile of weeds which give no flames and burn with a slow heat
667	metamorphoses	Often she longed to die so that she need not look on, often to tell her stern father of it as a crime
668	metamorphoses	 Finally she sat down at her sister’s threshold to oppose the god’s entrance when he came
669	metamorphoses	 When he threw compliments, prayers and gentlest words at her, she said ‘Stop now, since I won’t go from here until I have driven you away
670	metamorphoses	’ ‘We’ll hold to that contract’ Cyllenius quickly replied, and he opened the door with a touch of his heavenly wand
671	metamorphoses	 At this the girl tried to rise, but found her limbs, bent from sitting, unable to move from dull heaviness
672	metamorphoses	 When she tried to lift her body, her knees were rigid, cold sank through her to her fingernails, and her arteries grew pale with loss of blood
673	metamorphoses	As an untreatable cancer slowly spreads more widely bringing disease to still undamaged parts so a lethal chill gradually filled her breast sealing the vital paths and airways
674	metamorphoses	 She no longer tried to speak, and if she had tried, her voice had no means of exit
675	metamorphoses	 Already stone had gripped her neck, her features hardened, and she sat there, a bloodless statue
676	metamorphoses	 Nor was she white stone: her mind had stained it
677	metamorphoses	When Mercury had inflicted this punishment on the girl for her impious words and thoughts, he left Pallas’s land behind and flew to the heavens on outstretched wings
678	metamorphoses	 There his father calls him aside, and without revealing love as the reason, says ‘Son, faithful worker of my commands, go, quickly in your usual way, fly down to where, in an eastern land, they observe your mother’s star, among the Pleiades, (the inhabitants give it the name of Sidon)
679	metamorphoses	 There drive the herd of royal cattle, that you will see some distance off, grazing the mountain grass, towards the sea shore!’ He spoke, and immediately, as he commanded, the cattle, driven from the mountain, headed for the shore, where the great king’s daughter, Europa, used to play together with the Tyrian virgins
680	metamorphoses	 Royalty and love do not sit well together, nor stay long in the same house
681	metamorphoses	 So the father and ruler of the gods, who is armed with the three-forked lightning in his right hand, whose nod shakes the world, setting aside his royal sceptre, took on the shape of a bull, lowed among the other cattle, and, beautiful to look at, wandered in the tender grass
682	metamorphoses	In colour he was white as the snow that rough feet have not trampled and the rain-filled south wind has not melted
683	metamorphoses	 The muscles rounded out his neck, the dewlaps hung down in front, the horns were twisted, but one might argue they were made by hand, purer and brighter than pearl
684	metamorphoses	 His forehead was not fearful, his eyes were not formidable, and his expression was peaceful
685	metamorphoses	 Agenor’s daughter marvelled at how beautiful he was and how unthreatening
686	metamorphoses	 But though he seemed so gentle she was afraid at first to touch him
687	metamorphoses	 Soon she drew close and held flowers out to his glistening mouth
688	metamorphoses	 The lover was joyful and while he waited for his hoped-for pleasure he kissed her hands
689	metamorphoses	 He could scarcely separate then from now
690	metamorphoses	 At one moment he frolics and runs riot in the grass, at another he lies down, white as snow on the yellow sands
691	metamorphoses	 When her fear has gradually lessened he offers his chest now for virgin hands to pat and now his horns to twine with fresh wreaths of flowers
692	metamorphoses	 The royal virgin even dares to sit on the bull’s back, not realising whom she presses on, while the god, first from dry land and then from the shoreline, gradually slips his deceitful hooves into the waves
693	metamorphoses	 Then he goes further out and carries his prize over the mid-surface of the sea
694	metamorphoses	 She is terrified and looks back at the abandoned shore she has been stolen from and her right hand grips a horn, the other his back, her clothes fluttering, winding, behind her in the breeze
695	metamorphoses	And now the god, dispensing with the deceptive image of the bull, confessed who he was, and made for the fields of Crete
696	metamorphoses	 Meanwhile Europa’s father, in ignorance of this, orders his son Cadmus to search for the stolen girl, and adds that exile is his punishment if he fails to find her, showing himself, by the same action, both pious and impious
697	metamorphoses	 Roaming the world (for who can discover whatever Jupiter has taken?) Agenor’s son, the fugitive, shuns his native land and his parent’s anger and as a suppliant consults Apollo’s oracle and asks in what land he might settle
698	metamorphoses	 Phoebus replies ‘A heifer will find you in the fields, that has never submitted to the yoke and is unaccustomed to the curved plough
699	metamorphoses	 Go where she leads, and where she finds rest on the grass build the walls of Thebes, your city, and call the land Boeotia
700	metamorphoses	"’
"
701	metamorphoses	Cadmus had scarcely left the Castalian cave when he saw an unguarded heifer, moving slowly, and showing no mark of the yoke on her neck
702	metamorphoses	 He follows close behind and chooses his steps by the traces of her course, and silently thanks Phoebus, his guide to the way
703	metamorphoses	 Now he had passed the fords of Cephisus and the fields of Panope: the heifer stopped, and lifting her beautiful head with its noble horns to the sky stirred the air with her lowing
704	metamorphoses	 Then looking back, to see her companion following, she sank her hindquarters on the ground and lowered her body onto the tender grass
705	metamorphoses	 Cadmus gave thanks, pressing his lips to the foreign soil and welcoming the unknown hills and fields
706	metamorphoses	Intending to offer a sacrifice to Jupiter, he ordered his attendants to go in search of water from a running stream for a libation
707	metamorphoses	 There was an ancient wood there, free from desecration, and, in the centre of it, a chasm thick with bushes and willow branches, framed in effect by stones making a low arch, and rich with copious springs
708	metamorphoses	 There was a snake sacred to Mars concealed in this cave, with a prominent golden crest
709	metamorphoses	 Fire flickered in its eyes, its whole body was swollen with venom, its three-forked tongue flickered, and its teeth were set in a triple row
710	metamorphoses	After the people of Tyre, setting out, a fatal step, reached the grove, and let their pitchers down into the water, it gave out a reverberation
711	metamorphoses	 The dark green snake thrust his head out of the deep cavern, hissing awesomely
712	metamorphoses	 The pitchers fell from their hands, the blood left their bodies, and, terrified, a sudden tremor took possession of their limbs
713	metamorphoses	 The snake winds his scaly coils in restless writhings, and, shooting upwards, curves into a huge arc
714	metamorphoses	 With half its length raised into thin air, it peers down over the whole wood, its body as great, seen in its entirety, as that Dragon that separates the twin constellations of the Bear
715	metamorphoses	 Without pause he takes the Phoenicians, whether they prepare to fight, run, or are held by fear itself
716	metamorphoses	 Some he slays with his bite, some he kills in his deep embraces, others with the corrupting putrefaction of his venomous breath
717	metamorphoses	The sun had reached the heights of the sky, and driven away the shadows
718	metamorphoses	 And now the son of Agenor, wondering what has delayed his friends, searches for the men
719	metamorphoses	 He is covered with the pelt stripped from a lion
720	metamorphoses	 His sword is tipped with glittering iron
721	metamorphoses	 He has a spear, and better still a spirit superior to all
722	metamorphoses	 When he enters the wood and sees the dead bodies, and over them the victorious enemy, with its vast body, licking at their sad wounds with a bloody tongue, he cries out ‘Faithful hearts, I shall either be the avenger of your deaths, or become your companion’
723	metamorphoses	So saying he lifted a massive rock with his right hand and with great effort hurled the huge weight
724	metamorphoses	 Steep walls with their high turrets, would have been shattered by the force of the blow, but the snake remained unwounded, protected by its scales like a breastplate, and its dark, hard skin repelled the powerful stroke
725	metamorphoses	But that same hardness cannot keep out the spear that defeats it, that is fixed in a curve of its pliant back, and sinks its whole iron blade into its entrails
726	metamorphoses	 The creature maddened with pain twists its head over its back, sees the wound, and bites at the shaft lodged there
727	metamorphoses	 Even when the snake had loosened its hold all round by its powerful efforts, it could scarcely rip it from its flesh and the iron stayed fixed in its spine
728	metamorphoses	 Then indeed new purpose was added to its usual wrath: its throat swells, the veins fill, and white spume flecks its baleful jaws
729	metamorphoses	 The earth resounds to its scaly scraping and a black breath like that from the mouth of the Styx fouls the corrupted air
730	metamorphoses	 At one instant it coils in vast spiralling circles, at another rears up straighter than a high tree
731	metamorphoses	 Again it rushes on like a rain-filled river and knocks down all the trees obstructing it in front
732	metamorphoses	 The son of Agenor gives way a little withstanding its attacks by means of the lion’s skin and keeps back the ravening jaws by thrusting forward the point of his sword
733	metamorphoses	 The snake is maddened and bites uselessly at the hard iron and only drives the sharp point between its teeth
734	metamorphoses	Now the blood begins to drip from its venomous throat and soak the green grass with its spattering
735	metamorphoses	 But the wound is slight, because the serpent draws back from the thrust, pulling its wounded neck away, and, conceding its wound, keeps back the sword, and does not let it sink deeper
736	metamorphoses	 But the son of Agenor following it all the time presses the embedded iron into its throat, until an oak-tree blocks its backward course and neck and tree are pinned together
737	metamorphoses	 The tree bends under the serpent’s weight and the trunk of the oak groans with the lashing of its tail
738	metamorphoses	While the conqueror stares at the vast bulk of his conquered enemy, suddenly a voice is heard
739	metamorphoses	 It is not easy to imagine where it comes from, but it is heard
740	metamorphoses	 ‘Why gaze, son of Agenor, at the serpent you have killed? You too shall be a serpent to be gazed on
741	metamorphoses	’ For a long time he stands there quaking, and at the same time loses colour in his face, and his hair stands on end in cold terror
742	metamorphoses	 Then, behold, Pallas, the hero’s guardian approaches, sinking down through the upper air, and orders him to turn the earth and sow the dragon’s teeth, destined to generate a people
743	metamorphoses	 He obeys, and opening the furrows with a slice of his plough, sows the teeth in the ground, as human seed
744	metamorphoses	 Then, almost beyond belief, the cultivated earth begins to move, and first spear points appear among the furrows, next helmets nodding their painted crests, then chests and shoulders spring up, and arms weighed down with spears, and the field is thick with the round shields of warriors
745	metamorphoses	 Just as at festivals in the theatre, when the curtain is lifted at the end, designs rise in the air, first revealing faces and then gradually the rest, until, raised gently and steadily, they are seen whole, and at last their feet rest on the lower border
746	metamorphoses	Alarmed by this new enemy Cadmus was about to take up his weapons: ‘Keep away’ one of the army, that the earth had produced, cried at him ‘and take no part in our internal wars!’ So saying he raised his sharp sword against one of his earth-born brothers nearby, then, himself, fell to a spear thrown from far off
747	metamorphoses	 But the one who killed him lived no longer than he did and breathed out the air he had just breathed in
748	metamorphoses	 This example stirred them all equally, as if at a storm-wind, and, in their warring, these brothers of a moment were felled by mutual wounds
749	metamorphoses	 And now these youths, who were allowed such brief lives, were drumming on their mother’s breast hot with their blood
750	metamorphoses	 Five were still standing, one of whom was Echion
751	metamorphoses	 He, at a warning from Pallas, threw his weapons on the ground and sought assurances of peace from his brothers, and gave them in return
752	metamorphoses	 The Sidonian wanderer had these men as companions in his task when he founded the city commanded by Apollo’s oracle
753	metamorphoses	Now Thebes stands, and now you might be seen as happy, in your exile, Cadmus
754	metamorphoses	 You have Mars and Venus as your bride’s parents, and added to this the children of so noble a wife, so many sons and daughters, and dearly loved descendants, your grandchildren, who now are young men
755	metamorphoses	 But in truth we should always wait for a man’s last day, for that time when he has paid his last debt, and we should call no man’s life happy until he is dead
756	metamorphoses	Actaeon, one of your grandsons, was your first reason for grief, in all your happiness, Cadmus
757	metamorphoses	 Strange horns appeared on his forehead, and his hunting dogs sated themselves on the blood of their master
758	metamorphoses	 But if you look carefully, you will find that it was the fault of chance and not wickedness: what wickedness is there in error? It happened on a mountain, stained with the blood of many creatures, and midday had contracted every shadow and the sun was equidistant from either end of his journey
759	metamorphoses	 Then Actaeon, the young Boeotian, with a quiet expression, spoke to his companions in the hunt as they wandered through the solitary wilds ‘Friends, our spears and nets are drenched with the blood of our victims, and the day has been fortunate enough
760	metamorphoses	 When Aurora in her golden chariot brings another day we will resume our purpose
761	metamorphoses	 Now Phoebus is also between the limits of his task, and is splitting open the earth with his heat
762	metamorphoses	 Finish your present task and carry home the netted meshes
763	metamorphoses	’ The men obeyed his order and left off their labour
764	metamorphoses	There was a valley there called Gargaphie, dense with pine trees and sharp cypresses, sacred to Diana of the high-girded tunic, where, in the depths, there is a wooded cave, not fashioned by art
765	metamorphoses	 But ingenious nature had imitated art
766	metamorphoses	 She had made a natural arch out of native pumice and porous tufa
767	metamorphoses	 On the right, a spring of bright clear water murmured into a widening pool, enclosed by grassy banks
768	metamorphoses	 Here the woodland goddess, weary from the chase, would bathe her virgin limbs in the crystal liquid
769	metamorphoses	Having reached the place, she gives her spear, quiver and unstrung bow to one of the nymphs, her weapon-bearer
770	metamorphoses	 Another takes her robe over her arm, while two unfasten the sandals on her feet
771	metamorphoses	 Then, more skilful than the rest, Theban Crocale gathers the hair strewn around her neck into a knot, while her own is still loose
772	metamorphoses	 Nephele, Hyale, Rhanis, Psecas and Phiale draw water, and pour it over their mistress out of the deep jars
773	metamorphoses	While Titania is bathing there, in her accustomed place, Cadmus’s grandson, free of his share of the labour, strays with aimless steps through the strange wood, and enters the sacred grove
774	metamorphoses	 So the fates would have it
775	metamorphoses	 As soon as he reaches the cave mouth dampened by the fountain, the naked nymphs, seeing a man’s face, beat at their breasts and filling the whole wood with their sudden outcry, crowd round Diana to hide her with their bodies
776	metamorphoses	 But the goddess stood head and shoulders above all the others
777	metamorphoses	 Diana’s face, seen there, while she herself was naked, was the colour of clouds stained by the opposing shafts of sun, or Aurora’s brightness
778	metamorphoses	However, though her band of nymphs gathered in confusion around her, she stood turning to one side, and looking back, and wishing she had her arrows to hand
779	metamorphoses	 She caught up a handful of the water that she did have, and threw it in the man’s face
780	metamorphoses	 And as she sprinkled his hair with the vengeful drops she added these words, harbingers of his coming ruin, ‘Now you may tell, if you can tell that is, of having seen me naked!’ Without more threats, she gave the horns of a mature stag to the head she had sprinkled, lengthening his neck, making his ear-tips pointed, changing feet for hands, long legs for arms, and covering his body with a dappled hide
781	metamorphoses	 And then she added fear
782	metamorphoses	 Autonoë’s brave son flies off, marvelling at such swift speed, within himself
783	metamorphoses	 But when he sees his head and horns reflected for certain in the water, he tries to say ‘Oh, look at me!’ but no voice follows
784	metamorphoses	 He groans: that is his voice, and tears run down his altered face
785	metamorphoses	 Only his mind remains unchanged
786	metamorphoses	 What can he do? Shall he return to his home and the royal palace, or lie hidden in the woods? Shame prevents the one, and fear the other
787	metamorphoses	While he hesitates his dogs catch sight of him
788	metamorphoses	 First ‘Black-foot’, Melampus, and keen-scented Ichnobates, ‘Tracker’, signal him with baying, Ichnobates out of Crete, Melampus, Sparta
789	metamorphoses	 Then others rush at him swift as the wind, ‘Greedy’, Pamphagus, Dorceus, ‘Gazelle’, Oribasos, ‘Mountaineer’, all out of Arcady: powerful ‘Deerslayer’, Nebrophonos, savage Theron, ‘Whirlwind’, and Laelape, ‘Hunter’
790	metamorphoses	Then swift-footed Pterelas, ‘Wings’, and trail-scenting Agre, ‘Chaser’, fierce Hylaeus, ‘Woody’, lately gored by a boar, the wolf-born Nape, ‘Valley’, Poemenis, the trusty ‘Shepherd’, and Harpyia, ‘Snatcher’, with her two pups
791	metamorphoses	 There is thin-flanked Sicyonian Ladon, ‘Catcher’, Dromas, ‘Runner’, ‘Grinder’, Canache, Sticte ‘Spot’, Tigris ‘Tigress’, Alce, ‘Strong’, and white-haired Leucon, ‘Whitey’, and black-haired Asbolus, ‘Soot’
792	metamorphoses	Lacon, ‘Spartan’, follows them, a dog well known for his strength, and strong-running Aëllo, ‘Storm’
793	metamorphoses	 Then Thoos, ‘Swift’, and speedy Lycisce, ‘Wolf’, with her brother Cyprius ‘Cyprian’
794	metamorphoses	 Next ‘Grasper’, Harpalos, with a distinguishing mark of white, in the centre of his black forehead, ‘Black’, Melaneus, and Lachne, ‘Shaggy’, with hairy pelt, Labros, ‘Fury’, and Argiodus, ‘White-tooth’, born of a Cretan sire and Spartan dam, keen-voiced Hylactor, ‘Barker’, and others there is no need to name
795	metamorphoses	 The pack of them, greedy for the prey follow over cliffs and crags, and inaccessible rocks, where the way is hard or there is no way at all
796	metamorphoses	 He runs, over the places where he has often chased, flying, alas, from his own hounds
797	metamorphoses	 He longs to shout ‘I am Actaeon! Know your own master!’ but words fail him, the air echoes to the baying
798	metamorphoses	First ‘Black-hair’, Melanchaetes, wounds his back, then ‘Killer’, Theridamas, and Oresitrophos, the ‘Climber’, clings to his shoulder
799	metamorphoses	 They had set out late but outflanked the route by a shortcut over the mountains
800	metamorphoses	 While they hold their master the whole pack gathers and they sink their teeth in his body till there is no place left to wound him
801	metamorphoses	 He groans and makes a noise, not human, but still not one a deer could make, and fills familiar heights with mournful cries
802	metamorphoses	 And on his knees, like a suppliant begging, he turns his wordless head from side to side, as if he were stretching arms out towards them
803	metamorphoses	Now his friends, unknowingly, urge the ravening crowd of dogs on with their usual cries, looking out for Actaeon, and shouting, in emulation, for absent Actaeon (he turning his head at the sound of his name) complaining he is not there, and through his slowness is missing the spectacle offered by their prey
804	metamorphoses	 He might wish to be absent it’s true, but he is here: he might wish to see and not feel the fierce doings of his own hounds
805	metamorphoses	 They surround him on every side, sinking their jaws into his flesh, tearing their master to pieces in the deceptive shape of the deer
806	metamorphoses	 They say Diana the Quiver-bearer’s anger was not appeased, until his life had ended in innumerable wounds
807	metamorphoses	The debate is undecided: to some the punishment is more violent than just, merely for seeing the face of a goddess, others approve it and call it fitting because of her strict vow of virginity, and both can make a case
808	metamorphoses	 Only Jupiter’s wife was saying nothing, neither of praise or blame
809	metamorphoses	 She was glad of the disaster that had come down on the house of Agenor, and had transferred her hatred from Europa, to those who were allied to the Tyrian girl by birth
810	metamorphoses	 Then there was a fresh wrong added to the first
811	metamorphoses	 She was grieved by the fact that Semele was pregnant, with the seed of mighty Jove
812	metamorphoses	 Swallowing words of reproach, she said ‘What, in truth, have I gained from frequent reproaches? I must attack her
813	metamorphoses	 If I am rightly to be called most powerful Juno, if it is right for me to hold the jewelled sceptre in my hand, if I am queen, and sister and wife of Jove, sister at least, then it is her I must destroy
814	metamorphoses	 Yet I think she is content with her secret, and the injury to my marriage will be brief
815	metamorphoses	 But she has conceived – and that damages me – and makes her crime visible in her swollen belly, and wants, what I have barely achieved, to be confirmed as the mother of Jupiter’s child, so great is her faith in her beauty
816	metamorphoses	 I will render that faith hollow
817	metamorphoses	 I am not Saturnia if she does not plunge into the Stygian waters, overwhelmed by Jove himself
818	metamorphoses	"’
"
819	metamorphoses	At this she rose from her seat and cloaked in a dark cloud she came to Semele’s threshold
820	metamorphoses	 But before she removed the cloud she disguised herself as an old woman, ageing her hair, ploughing her skin with wrinkles, and walking with bowed legs and tottering steps
821	metamorphoses	 She made her voice sound old and was herself Beroë, Semele’s Epidaurian nurse
822	metamorphoses	 So, when they came to Jupiter’s name, in the midst of their lengthy gossiping, she sighed, and said ‘I hope, for your sake, that it really is Jupiter, but I am suspicious of all that sort of thing
823	metamorphoses	 Many men have entered the bedrooms of chaste women in the name of the gods
824	metamorphoses	 It’s not good enough for him merely to be Jove: he must give a proof of his love if it truly is him
825	metamorphoses	 Beg him to assume all his powers before he embraces you, and be just as glorious as when Juno welcomes him on high
826	metamorphoses	"’
"
827	metamorphoses	With such words Juno gulled the unsuspecting daughter of Cadmus
828	metamorphoses	 Semele asked Jupiter for an unspecified gift
829	metamorphoses	 ‘Choose!’ said the god, ‘Nothing will be refused, and, so that you may believe it more firmly, I swear it by the Stygian torrent, that is the divine conscience, the fear, and god, of all the gods
830	metamorphoses	’ Pleased by her misfortune, too successful, and doomed to be undone by her lover’s indulgence, Semele said ‘As Saturnia is used to your embrace, when you enter into the pact of Venus, give yourself to me!’ The god would have stopped her lips as she spoke: but her voice had already rushed into the air
831	metamorphoses	He groans, since she cannot un-wish it or he un-swear it
832	metamorphoses	 So, most sorrowfully, he climbs the heights of heaven, and, with a look, gathered the trailing clouds, then added their vapours to lightning mixed with storm-winds, and thunder and fateful lightning bolts
833	metamorphoses	 Still, he tries to reduce his power in whatever way he can, and does not arm himself with that lightning with which he deposed hundred-handed Typhoeus: it is too savage in his grasp
834	metamorphoses	 There is a lighter dart to which the Cyclops’s hands gave a less violent fire, a lesser anger
835	metamorphoses	 The gods call these his secondary weapons
836	metamorphoses	 Taking these he enters Agenor’s house
837	metamorphoses	 But still Semele’s mortal body could not endure the storm, and she was consumed, by the fire of her nuptial gift
838	metamorphoses	The infant Bacchus, still unfinished, is torn from the mother’s womb, and (if it can be believed) is sewn into his father’s thigh to complete his full term
839	metamorphoses	 Ino, his mother’s sister reared him secretly, in infancy, and then he was given to the nymphs of Mount Nysa who hid him in their cave and fed him on milk
840	metamorphoses	While these things were brought about on earth because of that fatal oath, and while twice-born Bacchus’s cradle remained safe, they say that Jupiter, expansive with wine, set aside his onerous duties, and relaxing, exchanging pleasantries, with Juno, said ‘You gain more than we do from the pleasures of love
841	metamorphoses	’ She denied it
842	metamorphoses	 They agreed to ask learned Tiresias for his opinion
843	metamorphoses	 He had known Venus in both ways
844	metamorphoses	Once, with a blow of his stick, he had disturbed two large snakes mating in the green forest, and, marvellous to tell, he was changed from a man to a woman, and lived as such for seven years
845	metamorphoses	 In the eighth year he saw the same snakes again and said ‘Since there is such power in plaguing you that it changes the giver of a blow to the opposite sex, I will strike you again, now
846	metamorphoses	’ He struck the snakes and regained his former shape, and returned to the sex he was born with
847	metamorphoses	As the arbiter of the light-hearted dispute he confirmed Jupiter’s words
848	metamorphoses	 Saturnia, it is said, was more deeply upset than was justified and than the dispute warranted, and damned the one who had made the judgement to eternal night
849	metamorphoses	 But, since no god has the right to void what another god has done, the all-powerful father of the gods gave Tiresias knowledge of the future, in exchange for his lost sight, and lightened the punishment with honour
850	metamorphoses	Famous throughout all the Aonian cities, Tiresias gave faultless answers to people who consulted him
851	metamorphoses	 Dusky Liriope, the Naiad, was the first to test the truth and the accuracy of his words, whom once the river-god Cephisus clasped in his winding streams, and took by force under the waves
852	metamorphoses	 This loveliest of nymphs gave birth at full term to a child whom, even then, one could fall in love with, called Narcissus
853	metamorphoses	 Being consulted as to whether the child would live a long life, to a ripe old age, the seer with prophetic vision replied ‘If he does not discover himself’
854	metamorphoses	For a long time the augur’s pronouncement appeared empty words
855	metamorphoses	 But in the end it proved true: the outcome, and the cause of his death, and the strangeness of his passion
856	metamorphoses	 One year the son of Cephisus had reached sixteen and might seem both boy and youth
857	metamorphoses	 Many youths, and many young girls desired him
858	metamorphoses	 But there was such intense pride in that delicate form that none of the youths or young girls affected him
859	metamorphoses	 One day the nymph Echo saw him, driving frightened deer into his nets, she of the echoing voice, who cannot be silent when others have spoken, nor learn how to speak first herself
860	metamorphoses	Echo still had a body then and was not merely a voice
861	metamorphoses	 But though she was garrulous, she had no other trick of speech than she has now: she can repeat the last words out of many
862	metamorphoses	 Juno made her like that, because often when she might have caught the nymphs lying beneath her Jupiter, on the mountain slopes, Echo knowingly held her in long conversations, while the nymphs fled
863	metamorphoses	 When Saturnia realised this she said ‘I shall give you less power over that tongue by which I have been deluded, and the briefest ability to speak’ and what she threatened she did
864	metamorphoses	 Echo only repeats the last of what is spoken and returns the words she hears
865	metamorphoses	Now when she saw Narcissus wandering through the remote fields, she was inflamed, following him secretly, and the more she followed the closer she burned with fire, no differently than inflammable sulphur, pasted round the tops of torches, catches fire, when a flame is brought near it
866	metamorphoses	 O how often she wants to get close to him with seductive words, and call him with soft entreaties! Her nature denies it, and will not let her begin, but she is ready for what it will allow her to do, to wait for sounds, to which she can return words
867	metamorphoses	By chance, the boy, separated from his faithful band of followers, had called out ‘Is anyone here?’ and ‘Here’ Echo replied
868	metamorphoses	 He is astonished, and glances everywhere, and shouts in a loud voice ‘Come to me!’ She calls as he calls
869	metamorphoses	 He looks back, and no one appearing behind, asks ‘Why do you run from me?’ and receives the same words as he speaks
870	metamorphoses	 He stands still, and deceived by the likeness to an answering voice, says ‘Here, let us meet together’
871	metamorphoses	 And, never answering to another sound more gladly, Echo replies ‘Together’, and to assist her words comes out of the woods to put her arms around his neck, in longing
872	metamorphoses	 He runs from her, and running cries ‘Away with these encircling hands! May I die before what’s mine is yours
873	metamorphoses	"’ She answers, only ‘What’s mine is yours!’
"
874	metamorphoses	Scorned, she wanders in the woods and hides her face in shame among the leaves, and from that time on lives in lonely caves
875	metamorphoses	 But still her love endures, increased by the sadness of rejection
876	metamorphoses	 Her sleepless thoughts waste her sad form, and her body’s strength vanishes into the air
877	metamorphoses	 Only her bones and the sound of her voice are left
878	metamorphoses	 Her voice remains, her bones, they say, were changed to shapes of stone
879	metamorphoses	 She hides in the woods, no longer to be seen on the hills, but to be heard by everyone
880	metamorphoses	 It is sound that lives in her
881	metamorphoses	As Narcissus had scorned her, so he had scorned the other nymphs of the rivers and mountains, so he had scorned the companies of young men
882	metamorphoses	 Then one of those who had been mocked, lifting hands to the skies, said ‘So may he himself love, and so may he fail to command what he loves!’ Rhamnusia, who is the goddess Nemesis, heard this just request
883	metamorphoses	There was an unclouded fountain, with silver-bright water, which neither shepherds nor goats grazing the hills, nor other flocks, touched, that no animal or bird disturbed not even a branch falling from a tree
884	metamorphoses	 Grass was around it, fed by the moisture nearby, and a grove of trees that prevented the sun from warming the place
885	metamorphoses	 Here, the boy, tired by the heat and his enthusiasm for the chase, lies down, drawn to it by its look and by the fountain
886	metamorphoses	 While he desires to quench his thirst, a different thirst is created
887	metamorphoses	 While he drinks he is seized by the vision of his reflected form
888	metamorphoses	 He loves a bodiless dream
889	metamorphoses	 He thinks that a body, which is only a shadow
890	metamorphoses	 He is astonished by himself, and hangs there motionless, with a fixed expression, like a statue carved from Parian marble
891	metamorphoses	Flat on the ground, he contemplates two stars, his eyes, and his hair, fit for Bacchus, fit for Apollo, his youthful cheeks and ivory neck, the beauty of his face, the rose-flush mingled in the whiteness of snow, admiring everything for which he is himself admired
892	metamorphoses	 Unknowingly he desires himself, and the one who praises is himself praised, and, while he courts, is courted, so that, equally, he inflames and burns
893	metamorphoses	 How often he gave his lips in vain to the deceptive pool, how often, trying to embrace the neck he could see, he plunged his arms into the water, but could not catch himself within them! What he has seen he does not understand, but what he sees he is on fire for, and the same error both seduces and deceives his eyes
894	metamorphoses	Fool, why try to catch a fleeting image, in vain? What you search for is nowhere: turning away, what you love is lost! What you perceive is the shadow of reflected form: nothing of you is in it
895	metamorphoses	" It comes and stays with you, and leaves with you, if you can leave!
"
896	metamorphoses	No care for Ceres’s gift of bread, or for rest, can draw him away
897	metamorphoses	 Stretched on the shadowed grass he gazes at that false image with un-sated eyes, and loses himself in his own vision
898	metamorphoses	 Raising himself a little way and holding his arms out to the woods, he asks, ‘Has anyone ever loved more cruelly than I? You must know, since you have been a chance hiding place for many people
899	metamorphoses	 Do you remember in your life that lasts so many centuries, in all the long ages past, anyone who pined away like this? I am enchanted and I see, but I cannot reach what I see and what enchants me’ – so deep in error is this lover – ‘and it increases my pain the more, that no wide sea separates us, no road, no mountains, no walls with locked doors
900	metamorphoses	We are only kept apart by a little water! Whenever I extend my lips to the clear liquid, he tries to raise his lips to me
901	metamorphoses	 He desires to be held
902	metamorphoses	 You would think he could be touched: it is such a small thing that prevents our love
903	metamorphoses	 Whoever you are come out to me! Why do you disappoint me, you extraordinary boy? Where do you vanish when I reach for you? Surely my form and years are not what you flee from, and I am one that the nymphs have loved! You offer me some unknown hope with your friendly look, and when I stretch my arms out to you, you stretch out yours
904	metamorphoses	 When I smile, you smile back
905	metamorphoses	 And I have often seen your tears when I weep tears
906	metamorphoses	" You return the gesture of my head with a nod, and, from the movements of your lovely mouth, I guess that you reply with words that do not reach my ears!
"
907	metamorphoses	I am he
908	metamorphoses	 I sense it and I am not deceived by my own image
909	metamorphoses	 I am burning with love for myself
910	metamorphoses	 I move and bear the flames
911	metamorphoses	 What shall I do? Surely not court and be courted? Why court then? What I want I have
912	metamorphoses	 My riches make me poor
913	metamorphoses	 O I wish I could leave my own body! Strange prayer for a lover, I desire what I love to be distant from me
914	metamorphoses	 Now sadness takes away my strength, not much time is left for me to live, and I am cut off in the prime of youth
915	metamorphoses	 Nor is dying painful to me, laying down my sadness in death
916	metamorphoses	 I wish that him I love might live on, but now we shall die united, two in one spirit
917	metamorphoses	"’
"
918	metamorphoses	He spoke, and returned madly to the same reflection, and his tears stirred the water, and the image became obscured in the rippling pool
919	metamorphoses	 As he saw it vanishing, he cried out ‘Where do you fly to? Stay, cruel one, do not abandon one who loves you! I am allowed to gaze at what I cannot touch, and so provide food for my miserable passion!’ While he weeps, he tears at the top of his clothes: then strikes his naked chest with hands of marble
920	metamorphoses	 His chest flushes red when they strike it, as apples are often pale in part, part red, or as grapes in their different bunches are stained with purple when they are not yet ripe
921	metamorphoses	As he sees all this reflected in the dissolving waves, he can bear it no longer, but as yellow wax melts in a light flame, as morning frost thaws in the sun, so he is weakened and melted by love, and worn away little by little by the hidden fire
922	metamorphoses	 He no longer retains his colour, the white mingled with red, no longer has life and strength, and that form so pleasing to look at, nor has he that body which Echo loved
923	metamorphoses	 Still, when she saw this, though angered and remembering, she pitied him, and as often as the poor boy said ‘Alas!’ she repeated with her echoing voice ‘Alas!’ and when his hands strike at his shoulders, she returns the same sounds of pain
924	metamorphoses	" His last words as he looked into the familiar pool were ‘Alas, in vain, beloved boy!’ and the place echoed every word, and when he said ‘Goodbye!’ Echo also said ‘Goodbye!’
"
925	metamorphoses	He laid down his weary head in the green grass, death closing those eyes that had marvelled at their lord’s beauty
926	metamorphoses	And even when he had been received into the house of shadows, he gazed into the Stygian waters
927	metamorphoses	 His sisters the Naiads lamented, and let down their hair for their brother, and the Dryads lamented
928	metamorphoses	 Echo returned their laments
929	metamorphoses	 And now they were preparing the funeral pyre, the quivering torches and the bier, but there was no body
930	metamorphoses	 They came upon a flower, instead of his body, with white petals surrounding a yellow heart
931	metamorphoses	When all this became known it spread the prophet’s fame throughout the cities of Achaia, and his reputation was high
932	metamorphoses	 Still, Pentheus, the son of Echion, in scorn of the gods, alone amongst all of them, rejected the seer, laughed at the old man’s words of augury, and taunted him with the darkness, and the ruin of his lost sight
933	metamorphoses	 He, shaking his white head in warning, said ‘How happy you would be if these dispossessed orbs were yours, so as not to see the sacred rites of Bacchus! Now the day approaches, and I see it is not far off, when the new god, Liber, son of Semele will come, and unless you think him worthy to be done honour in your sanctuaries, you will be scattered, torn, in a thousand pieces, and stain your mother, and her sisters and the woods themselves with your blood
934	metamorphoses	 It will be! You will not think the god worthy of being honoured, and you will lament of me, that in my darkness I have seen too far
935	metamorphoses	’ Even as he speaks, Echion’s son thrusts him away
936	metamorphoses	 The truth of his words followed, the oracles of the prophet were performed
937	metamorphoses	Liber has come, and the festive fields echo with cries
938	metamorphoses	 The crowd all run, fathers, mothers, young girls, princes and people, mixed together, swept towards the unknown rites
939	metamorphoses	 Pentheus shouts ‘What madness has stupefied your minds, children of the serpent, people of Mars? Can the clash of brazen cymbals, pipes of curved horn, and magical tricks be so powerful that men, who were not terrified by drawn swords or blaring trumpets or ranks of sharp spears, are overcome by the shrieks of women, men mad with wine, crowds of obscenities, and empty drumming? Should I admire you, elders, who, sailing the deep seas, sited your Tyre here, your exiled Penates, and now let them be taken without a fight? Or you younger men, of fresher age, nearer my own, for whom it was fitting to carry weapons and not the thyrsus, your heads covered with helmets not crowns of leaves? Remember, I beg you, from what roots you were created, and show the spirit of the serpent, who, though one alone, killed many
940	metamorphoses	 He died for his spring and pool, but you should conquer for your own glory! He put brave men to death, but you should make craven men run, and maintain the honour of your country! If it is Thebes’ fate to stand for only a short time, I wish her walls might be destroyed by men and siege engines, that fire and iron might sound against her! Then we would be miserable but not sinful, we would lament our fate not try to hide it, our tears would be free from shame
941	metamorphoses	 But now Thebes will be taken by an unarmed boy, who takes no pleasure in fighting, or weapons, or the use of horses, but in myrrh-drenched hair, soft wreathes of leaves, and embroidered robes woven with gold
942	metamorphoses	 But, if you stand aside, I will quickly force him to confess that his pretended parentage and religion are inventions
943	metamorphoses	" Should Pentheus and the rest of Thebes be terrified of his arrival, when Acrisius had courage enough to defy a false god, and shut the gates of Argos at his coming? ‘Go quickly’, he ordered his attendants ‘bind him and drag him here, this conqueror! Don’t be slow in carrying out your orders!’
"
944	metamorphoses	His grandfather, Cadmus, his uncle, Athamas, and the rest of his advisors reprove his words, and try in vain to restrain him
945	metamorphoses	 He is only made more eager by their warning, and his rage is maddened and grows with restraint, and he is provoked by their objections
946	metamorphoses	 So I have seen a river, where nothing obstructs its passage, flow calmly and with little noise, but rage and foam wherever trees and obstacles of stone held it back, fiercer for the obstruction
947	metamorphoses	See now, they return, stained with blood, and when their lord queries where Bacchus is, they deny having seen Bacchus, but reply, ‘We have captured this companion of his, a priest of his sacred rites’ and they hand over a man of Tyrrhenian stock, with his hands bound behind his back, a follower of the worship of the god
948	metamorphoses	" Pentheus looks at him, with eyes made terrible by anger, and although he can scarcely wait for the moment of punishment, he says ‘O you who are about to die, and, by your death, teach the others a lesson, tell me your name, your parents’ name and your country, and why you follow the customs of this new religion!’
"
949	metamorphoses	Without fear, he answers ‘My name is Acoetes, and Maeonia is my country, my parents humble ordinary people
950	metamorphoses	 My father did not leave me fields for sturdy oxen to work, no flocks of sheep, nor any cattle
951	metamorphoses	 I am poor as he himself was, and he used to catch fish in the streams with a rod and line and a hook to snare them
952	metamorphoses	 His skill was his wealth, and when he bequeathed it to me, he said ‘Take what I have
953	metamorphoses	 Apply yourself to the work as my successor and heir
954	metamorphoses	’ Dying, he left me nothing but water
955	metamorphoses	 The only thing I can call my inheritance
956	metamorphoses	Soon, so that I was not stuck for ever to the same rocks, I learned how to guide boats, steering oar in hand, and to observe Capella and the rainy stars of the Olenian Goat, Taÿgete among the Pleiades, the Hyades, and the Arctic Bears, the houses of the winds, and the havens for ships
957	metamorphoses	Heading for Delos, and being driven by chance onto the coast of the island of Chios, making shore by skilful use of the oars, giving a gentle leap, and landing on the wet sand, there we passed the night
958	metamorphoses	 As soon as the dawn began to redden, I ordered the getting in of fresh water, and showed the path that led to a spring
959	metamorphoses	 I myself commanded the view from a high hill to find what wind promised, called my comrades and went back to the boat
960	metamorphoses	 ‘See, we are here’ said Opheltes, the foremost of my friends, and led a boy, with the beauty of a virgin girl, along the shore, a prize, or so he thought, that he had found in a deserted field
961	metamorphoses	 The boy seemed to stumble, heavy with wine and sleep, and could scarcely follow
962	metamorphoses	 I examined his clothing, appearance and rank, and I saw nothing that made me think him mortal
963	metamorphoses	 And I felt this and said it to my companions ‘I do not know which god is in that body, but there is a god within! Whoever you are, O favour and assist our efforts, and forgive these men!’ ‘Don’t pray for us’ said Dictys, who was the quickest at climbing to the highest yard and sliding down grasping the rigging
964	metamorphoses	 So said Libys, and yellow-haired Melanthus, the forward look-out, and Alcimedon agreed, and Epopeus, who with his voice gave the measure and the pauses for the oarsmen to urge on their purpose
965	metamorphoses	 All the others said the same, so blind was their greed for gain
966	metamorphoses	‘I still will not allow this ship to be cursed by a sacred victim to whom violence has been done’ I said
967	metamorphoses	 ‘Here I have the greatest authority’
968	metamorphoses	 And I prevented them boarding
969	metamorphoses	 Then Lycabas the most audacious of them all began to rage at me, he who had been thrown out of Tuscany, and was suffering the punishment of exile from his city for a terrible murder
970	metamorphoses	 While I held him off, he punched me in the throat with his strong young fists, and would have thrown me semi-conscious into the sea, if I had not clung on, almost stunned, held back by the rigging
971	metamorphoses	 The impious crew cheered on the doer of it
972	metamorphoses	 Then, at last, Bacchus (for it was indeed Bacchus) was freed from sleep, as if by the clamour, and the sense returned to his drunken mind
973	metamorphoses	 ‘What are you doing? Why this shouting?’ he said
974	metamorphoses	" ‘Tell me, you seamen, how I came here? Where do you intend to take me?’ ‘Have no fear’, said Proreus, ‘and, whatever port you wish to touch at, you will be set down in the country you demand!’ ‘Naxos’ said Liber, ‘set your course for there! That is my home: it will be a friendly land to you!’
"
975	metamorphoses	The treacherous men swore, by the sea and all the gods, it would be so, and told me to get the painted vessel under sail
976	metamorphoses	 Naxos was to starboard, but as I trimmed the sails on a starboard tack, they, each one, asked me ‘What are you doing, O madman? Acoetes, what craziness has got into you? Take the port tack!’ most of them letting me know what they intended with a nod of the head, the others in a whisper
977	metamorphoses	 I was horrified
978	metamorphoses	 ‘Someone else can steer’ I said, and distanced myself from the wickedness and deception
979	metamorphoses	 There were cries against me from all sides, the whole crew murmured against me
980	metamorphoses	 And one of them, Aethalion, cried ‘You seem to think that all our lives depend on you alone!’ Then he took my place himself, discharged my office, and abandoning Naxos took the opposite course
981	metamorphoses	Then the god, playfully, as though he had just realised their deceit, looked at the sea over the curve of the stern, and as though he were weeping said ‘Sailors, these are not the shores you promised me, and this is not the land I chose for myself? What have I done to merit punishment? Where’s the glory in men cheating a boy, or many cheating just one?’ I was already weeping, but the impious crew laughed at my tears, and drove the ship quickly through the water
982	metamorphoses	Now I swear by the god himself (since there is no god more certainly present than he is) that what I say to you is the truth, though that truth beggars belief
983	metamorphoses	 The ship stands still in the waves, just as if it were held in dry dock
984	metamorphoses	 Amazed, the crew keep flogging away at the oars, and unfurling the sails, try to run on with double power
985	metamorphoses	 But ivy impedes the oars, creeping upwards, with binding tendrils, and drapes the sails with heavy clusters
986	metamorphoses	 The god himself waves a rod twined with vine leaves, his forehead wreathed with bunches of grapes
987	metamorphoses	 Around him lie insubstantial phantom lynxes, tigers, and the savage bodies of spotted panthers
988	metamorphoses	 The men leap overboard, driven to it either by madness or by fear
989	metamorphoses	 And Medon is the first to darken all over his body, and his spine to be bent into an arched curve
990	metamorphoses	Lycabas cries out to him ‘What monster are you turning into?’ And in speaking his jaws widen, his nose becomes hooked, and his skin becomes hard and scaly
991	metamorphoses	 But Libys hampered when he wishes to turn the oars sees his hands shrink suddenly in size, and now they are not hands, but can only be called fins
992	metamorphoses	 Another, eager to grasp at the tangled ropes, no longer has arms, and goes arching backwards limbless into the sea
993	metamorphoses	 His newest feature is a scythe-shaped tail, like the curved horns of a fragmentary moon
994	metamorphoses	 The dolphins leap everywhere drenched with spray
995	metamorphoses	 They emerge once more, only to return again to the depths, playing together as if they were in a troupe, throwing their bodies around wantonly, and blowing out the seawater drawn in through their broad nostrils
996	metamorphoses	Of a group of twenty (that was how many the ship carried) I alone was left
997	metamorphoses	 The god roused me with difficulty, my body shaking with cold and terror, and barely myself, saying ‘Free your heart from fear, and hold off for Naxos!’ And consigned to that island, I have adopted its religion, and celebrate the Bacchic rites
998	metamorphoses	‘We have only listened to this winding tale’, said Pentheus, ‘so that our anger might spend its strength in delay
999	metamorphoses	 ‘You, attendants, remove this man, quickly, and let his body be tortured in greatest anguish, and send him down to Stygian night!’ Acoetes, the Tyrrhenian, was dragged out, straightaway, and shut in a deep dungeon
1000	metamorphoses	 But while the instruments of cruelty, the irons and the fire, were being prepared to kill him as had been ordered, the doors flew open by themselves, the chains loosening without any effort, so tradition holds
1001	metamorphoses	The son of Echion persisted in his purpose, not ordering others to go, but now going himself, to where Mount Cithaeron, chosen for performing the rites, was sounding with the chants and shrill cries of the Bacchantes
1002	metamorphoses	 As a brave horse snorts and shows his love for the fight, when the trumpeter’s brass gives the signal for attack, so the heavens pulsating from the long drawn-out cries stirred Pentheus, and, hearing the clamour, his anger flared again
1003	metamorphoses	Near the middle of the mountainside, was a clearing surrounded with remote woods, free of trees, and visible from all sides
1004	metamorphoses	 Here as he watched the mysteries, with profane eyes, his mother was the first to see Pentheus, the first roused to run at him madly, the first to wound him, hurling her thyrsus
1005	metamorphoses	 She shouted ‘O you two, sisters, come! That huge boar, who is straying in our fields, that boar is my sacrifice
1006	metamorphoses	’ They all rush on him in one maddened crowd: they converge together pursuing the frightened man, frightened now, speaking words free of violence now, cursing himself now, realising his own offence
1007	metamorphoses	" Stricken, he still shouts ‘Help me, aunt Autonoë! Let Actaeon’s shade move your spirit!’
"
1008	metamorphoses	She, not remembering Actaeon, tears away the suppliant’s right arm
1009	metamorphoses	 Ino, in frenzy, rips off the other
1010	metamorphoses	 Now the unhappy man has no limbs to hold out to his mother, but, showing his wounded trunk shorn of its members, he cries ‘Mother, see!’
1011	metamorphoses	" Agave howls, and twists her neck about, and thrashes her hair in the air, and tearing off his head, holding it in her bloody hands, shouts ‘Behold, sisters, this act marks our victory!’
"
1012	metamorphoses	The wind does not strip the leaves clinging there, from the high tree touched by an autumn frost, more quickly than this man’s limbs are torn by those terrible hands
1013	metamorphoses	 Warned by such an example, the Theban women throng to the new religion, burn incense, and worship at the sacred altars
1014	metamorphoses	But Alcithoë, daughter of Minyas, will not celebrate the Bacchic rites, in acceptance of the god
1015	metamorphoses	 She is rash enough to deny that Bacchus is the son of Jupiter, and her sisters share in her impiety
1016	metamorphoses	The priest had ordered the observation of the festival, asking for all female servants to be released from work, they and their mistresses to drape animal skins across their breasts, free their headbands, wreathe their hair, and carry an ivy-twined thyrsus in their hand
1017	metamorphoses	 And he prophesied that the god’s rage would be fierce if he was angered
1018	metamorphoses	 The young women and mothers obey, leaving their baskets and looms, and their unfinished tasks, and burn incense, calling on Bacchus, on Bromius, ‘the noisy one’, Lyaeus, ‘deliverer from care’, on the child of the lightning, the twice-born, the son of two mothers, and adding to these calls Nyseus, ‘he of Heliconian Nysa’, Thyoneus, ‘the unshorn’ who is Semele’s son, Lenaeus, the planter of joy-giving vines, Nyctelius, ‘the nightcomer’, father Eleleus, of the howls, Iacchus, of the shouts, and Euhan, of the cries, and all of the other names you have, Liber, among the peoples of Greece
1019	metamorphoses	Unfading youth is yours, you boy eternal, you, the most beautiful sight in the depths of the morning and evening sky, your face like a virgin’s when you stand before us without your horns
1020	metamorphoses	 The Orient calls you its conqueror, as far as darkest India, dipped in the remote Ganges
1021	metamorphoses	 You, the revered one, punished Pentheus, and Lycurgus, king of Thrace, who carried the double-headed axe, and you sent the Tyrrhenians into the waves
1022	metamorphoses	 You yoke together two lynxes with bright reins decorating their necks, Bacchantes and Satyrs follow you, and that drunken old man, Silenus, who supports his stumbling body with his staff, and clings precariously to his bent-backed mule
1023	metamorphoses	 Wherever you go the shouts of youths ring out, and the chorus of female voices, hands beating on tambourines, the clash of cymbals, and the shrill piping of the flute
1024	metamorphoses	The Ismenides pray to Bacchus ‘Be satisfied with us, be gentle’ and they celebrate the rites ordained
1025	metamorphoses	 Only the daughters of Minyas remain inside, disturbing the festival, with the untimely arts of Minerva, drawing out strands of wool, twisting the threads with their fingers, or staying at their looms, and plying their servants with work
1026	metamorphoses	 Then one of them, Arsippe, speaks, spinning the thread lightly with her thumb
1027	metamorphoses	 ‘While the others are leaving their work, and thronging to this false religion, let us, restrained by Pallas, a truer goddess, lighten the useful work of our hands, and take turns in recalling a story to our idle minds, so that the time will not seem so long!’ Her sisters are pleased with this, and beg her to begin first
1028	metamorphoses	 She wondered which of many she should tell (since she knew very many), and hesitated whether to tell about you, Babylonian Dercetis, who, as the Syrians of Palestine believe, with altered shape, your lower limbs covered with scales, swam in the waters, or how your daughter, assuming wings, lived her earliest years out among the white dovecotes
1029	metamorphoses	 Or how a Naiad, with incantations, and all too powerful herbs, changed the bodies of youths into dumb fishes, until the same thing happened to her
1030	metamorphoses	 Or how the mulberry tree that bore white berries now bears dark red ones, from the stain of blood
1031	metamorphoses	 This one pleases her
1032	metamorphoses	 She begins to spin this tale, which is not yet well known, as she spins her woollen thread
1033	metamorphoses	‘Pyramus and Thisbe, he the loveliest youth, and she the most sought after girl, the East held, lived in neighbouring houses, in the towering city of Babylon, that Semiramis is said to have enclosed with walls of brick
1034	metamorphoses	 Their nearness and their first childhood steps made them acquainted and in time love appeared
1035	metamorphoses	 They would have agreed to swear the marriage oath as well, but their parents prevented it
1036	metamorphoses	 They were both on fire, with hearts equally captivated, something no parent can prevent
1037	metamorphoses	 They had no one to confide all this to: nods and signs were their speech, and the more they kept the fire hidden, the more it burned
1038	metamorphoses	There was a fissure, a thin split, in the shared wall between their houses, which traced back to when it was built
1039	metamorphoses	 No one had discovered the flaw in all those years – but what can love not detect? – You lovers saw it first, and made it a path for your voices
1040	metamorphoses	 Your endearments passed that way, in safety, in the gentlest of murmurs
1041	metamorphoses	 Often, when they were in place, Thisbe here, and Pyramus there, and they had each caught the sound of the other’s breath, they said “Unfriendly wall, why do you hinder lovers? How hard would it be for you to let our whole bodies meet, or if that is too much perhaps, to open to the kisses we give each other? Not that we are not grateful
1042	metamorphoses	 We confess that we owe it to you that words are allowed to pass to loving ears
1043	metamorphoses	” So they talked, hopelessly, sitting opposite, saying, as night fell, “Farewell”, each touching the wall with kisses that could not reach the other side
1044	metamorphoses	One morning when Aurora had quenched the fires of night, and the sun’s rays had thawed the frosty grass, they came to their usual places
1045	metamorphoses	 Then they decided, first with a little murmur of their great sorrows, to try, in the silence of night, to deceive the guards, and vanish outside
1046	metamorphoses	 Once out of the house they would leave the city as well, and they agreed, in case they went astray crossing the open country, to meet by the grave of Ninus, and hide in the shelter of a tree
1047	metamorphoses	 There was a tall mulberry tree there, dense with white berries, bordering a cool fountain
1048	metamorphoses	 They were satisfied with their plan, and the light, slow to lose its strength, was drowned in the waters, and out of the same waters the night emerged
1049	metamorphoses	"’
"
1050	metamorphoses	‘Carefully opening the door, Thisbe, slipped out, deceiving her people, and came to the tomb, her face veiled, and seated herself under the tree they had agreed on
1051	metamorphoses	 Love made her brave
1052	metamorphoses	 But a lioness fresh from the kill, her jaws foaming, smeared with the blood of cattle, came to slake her thirst at the nearby spring
1053	metamorphoses	 In the moonlight, Babylonian Thisbe sees her some way off, and flees in fear to a dark cave, and as she flees, she leaves behind her fallen veil
1054	metamorphoses	 When the fierce lioness has drunk deeply, returning towards the trees, she chances to find the flimsy fabric, without its owner, and rips it in her bloodstained jaws
1055	metamorphoses	 Leaving the city a little later, Pyramus sees the creature’s tracks in the thick dust, and his face is drained of colour
1056	metamorphoses	 When he also discovers the veil stained with blood, he cries, “Two lovers will be lost in one night
1057	metamorphoses	 She was the more deserving of a long life
1058	metamorphoses	 I am the guilty spirit
1059	metamorphoses	 I have killed you, poor girl, who told you to come by night to this place filled with danger, and did not reach it first
1060	metamorphoses	" O, all you lions, that live amongst these rocks, tear my body to pieces, and devour my sinful flesh in your fierce jaws! Though it is cowardly to ask for death”
"
1061	metamorphoses	He picks up Thisbe’s veil, and carries it with him to the shadow of the tree they had chosen
1062	metamorphoses	 Kissing the token, and wetting it with tears, he cries, “Now, be soaked in my blood too
1063	metamorphoses	” Having spoken he drove the sword he had been wearing into his groin, and, dying, pulled it, warm, from the wound
1064	metamorphoses	 As he lay back again on the ground, the blood spurted out, like a pipe fracturing at a weak spot in the lead, and sending long bursts of water hissing through the split, cutting through the air, beat by beat
1065	metamorphoses	 Sprinkled with blood, the tree’s fruit turned a deep blackish-red, and the roots, soaked through, also imbued the same overhanging mulberries with the dark purplish colour
1066	metamorphoses	"’
"
1067	metamorphoses	‘Now Thisbe returns, not yet free of fear, lest she disappoint her lover, and she calls for him with her eyes and in her mind, eager to tell him about the great danger she has escaped
1068	metamorphoses	 Though she recognises the place and the shape of the familiar tree, the colour of the berries puzzles her
1069	metamorphoses	 She waits there: perhaps this is it
1070	metamorphoses	 Hesitating, she sees quivering limbs writhing on the bloodstained earth, and starts back, terrified, like the sea, that trembles when the slightest breeze touches its surface, her face showing whiter than boxwood
1071	metamorphoses	 But when, staying a moment longer, she recognises her lover, she cries out loud with grief, striking at her innocent arms, and tearing at her hair
1072	metamorphoses	 Cradling the beloved body, she bathes his wounds with tears, mingling their drops with blood
1073	metamorphoses	 Planting kisses on his cold face, she cries out ‘Pyramus, what misfortune has robbed me of you? Pyramus, answer me! Your dearest Thisbe calls to you: obey me, lift your fallen head!’ At Thisbe’s name, Pyramus raised his eyes, darkening with death, and having looked at her, buried them again in darkness
1074	metamorphoses	"’
"
1075	metamorphoses	‘When she recognised her veil and saw the ivory scabbard without its sword, she said, “Unhappy boy, your own hand, and your love, have destroyed you! I too have a firm enough hand for once, and I, too, love
1076	metamorphoses	 It will give me strength in my misfortune
1077	metamorphoses	 I will follow you to destruction, and they will say I was a most pitiful friend and companion to you
1078	metamorphoses	 He, who could only be removed from me by death, death cannot remove
1079	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless I ask this for both of us, in uttering these words, O our poor parents, mine and his, do not deny us the right to be laid in one tomb, we whom certain love, and the strangest hour have joined
1080	metamorphoses	 And you, the tree, that now covers the one poor body with your branches, and soon will cover two, retain the emblems of our death, and always carry your fruit darkened in mourning, a remembrance of the blood of us both
1081	metamorphoses	"”
"
1082	metamorphoses	Saying this, and placing the point under her heart, she fell forward onto the blade, still warm with his blood
1083	metamorphoses	 Then her prayer moved the gods, and stirred her parents’ feelings, for the colour of the berry is blackish-red, when fully ripened, and what was left from the funeral pyres rests in a single urn
1084	metamorphoses	"’
"
1085	metamorphoses	Arsippe ceased
1086	metamorphoses	 There was a short pause and then Leuconoë began to speak, while her sisters were quiet
1087	metamorphoses	‘Love even takes Sol prisoner, who rules all the stars with his light
1088	metamorphoses	 I will tell you about his amours
1089	metamorphoses	 He was the first god they say to see the adulteries of Venus and Mars: he sees all things first
1090	metamorphoses	 He was sorry to witness the act, and he told her husband Vulcan, son of Juno, of this bedroom intrigue, and where the intrigue took place
1091	metamorphoses	 Vulcan’s heart dropped, and he dropped in turn the craftsman’s work he held in his hand
1092	metamorphoses	 Immediately he began to file thin links of bronze, for a net, a snare that would deceive the eye
1093	metamorphoses	 The finest spun threads, those the spider spins from the rafters, would not better his work
1094	metamorphoses	 He made it so it would cling to the smallest movement, the lightest touch, and then artfully placed it over the bed
1095	metamorphoses	 When the wife and the adulterer had come together on the one couch, they were entangled together, surprised in the midst of their embraces, by the husband’s craft, and the new method of imprisonment he had prepared for them
1096	metamorphoses	The Lemnian, Vulcan, immediately flung open the ivory doors, and let in the gods
1097	metamorphoses	 There the two lay shamefully bound together, and one of the gods, undismayed, prayed that he might be shamed like that
1098	metamorphoses	 And the gods laughed
1099	metamorphoses	 And for a long time it was the best-known story in all the heavens
1100	metamorphoses	"’
"
1101	metamorphoses	‘But Cytherea, remembering the informer, exacted punishment, and took revenge on him
1102	metamorphoses	 He who harmed her secret affair, was equally harmed by love
1103	metamorphoses	 Son of Hyperion, what use to you now, are beauty, lustre, and radiant light? Surely, you who make all countries burn with your fires, burn with a new fire
1104	metamorphoses	 You, who should discern everything, contemplate Leucothoë, and your eyes, that ought to be fixed on the whole earth, are fixed on one virgin girl
1105	metamorphoses	 Sometimes you rise too early in the dawn sky
1106	metamorphoses	 Sometimes you sink too late into the waves
1107	metamorphoses	 Thinking of her, you lengthen the winter hours
1108	metamorphoses	 Sometimes you vanish, your mind’s defect affecting your light, and, obscured, terrify men’s hearts
1109	metamorphoses	 It is not because the moon’s shadow, closer to the earth, eclipses you, that you fade
1110	metamorphoses	 It is that love of yours that determines your aspect
1111	metamorphoses	 You only love her
1112	metamorphoses	You forget Clymene, Phaethon’s mother, and the nymph Rhode, and Perse, the most beautiful mother of Aeaean Circe, and Clytie, although despised, seeks union with you, and, even now, suffers its deep wounds
1113	metamorphoses	 Leucothoë makes you forget them all, she whom loveliest Eurynome gave birth to, among the people who produce sweet-smelling incense
1114	metamorphoses	 But when the daughter grew to womanhood, she outshone her mother, as her mother surpassed all others
1115	metamorphoses	 Her father Orchamus ruled the Achaemenian Cities of Persia, seventh in line from ancient Belus, the founder

1117	metamorphoses	‘Under western skies are the fields of the horses of the Sun: they have ambrosia to crop not grass
1118	metamorphoses	 It nourishes their weary legs after the day’s work, and refreshes them for their labours
1119	metamorphoses	 While his horses browse on celestial food and while night carries out her role, the god enters his loved one’s room, taking on the shape of her mother, Eurynome
1120	metamorphoses	 There he finds Leucothoë in the lamplight, amongst her twelve maids, drawing out fine threads, winding them on her spindle
1121	metamorphoses	 So he gives her a kiss, just as a mother her dear daughter, and says “This is secret: servants, depart, and don’t rob a mother of the power to speak in private
1122	metamorphoses	” They obey, and when there are no witnesses left in the room, the god speaks
1123	metamorphoses	“Who measures the long year, I am he
1124	metamorphoses	 I see all things, earth sees all things by me, I, the world’s eye
1125	metamorphoses	 Trust me, you please me
1126	metamorphoses	” She is afraid, and, in her fear, distaff and spindle fall from her lifeless fingers
1127	metamorphoses	 Her fear enhances her, and he, waiting no longer, resumes his true form, and his accustomed brightness
1128	metamorphoses	 And, though the girl is alarmed by this sudden vision, overwhelmed by his brightness, suppressing all complaint, she submits to the assault of the god
1129	metamorphoses	"’
"
1130	metamorphoses	Clytie was jealous (there were no bounds to her love for Sol), and goaded by anger at her rival, she broadcast the adultery, and maligning the girl, betrayed her to her father
1131	metamorphoses	 He in his pride and savagery, buried her deep in the earth, she praying, stretching her hands out towards Sol’s light, crying “He forced me, against my will”, and he piled a heavy mound of sand over her
1132	metamorphoses	Poor nymph, Hyperion’s son dispersed this with shafts of light, and gave you a way to show your buried face, but you could not lift your head, crushed by the weight of earth, and lay there, a pale corpse
1133	metamorphoses	 They say the god of the winged horses had seen nothing more bitter than this, since Phaethon’s fiery death
1134	metamorphoses	 He tried to see if he could recall life to those frozen limbs, with his powerful rays
1135	metamorphoses	 But since fate opposed such efforts, he sprinkled the earth, and the body itself, with fragrant nectar, and, after much lamenting, said “You will still touch the air”
1136	metamorphoses	 Immediately the body, soaked through with heavenly nectar, dissolved, steeping the earth in its perfume
1137	metamorphoses	 Tentatively, putting out roots, the shoot of a tree, resinous with incense, grew through the soil, and pierced the summit of the mound
1138	metamorphoses	The god of light no longer visited Clytie, nor found anything to love in her, even though love might have been an excuse for her pain, and her pain for her betrayal
1139	metamorphoses	 She wasted away, deranged by her experience of love
1140	metamorphoses	 Impatient of the nymphs, night and day, under the open sky, she sat dishevelled, bareheaded, on the bare earth
1141	metamorphoses	 Without food or water, fasting, for nine days, she lived only on dew and tears, and did not stir from the ground
1142	metamorphoses	 She only gazed at the god’s aspect as he passed, and turned her face towards him
1143	metamorphoses	 They say that her limbs clung to the soil, and that her ghastly pallor changed part of her appearance to that of a bloodless plant: but part was reddened, and a flower like a violet hid her face
1144	metamorphoses	 She turns, always, towards the sun, though her roots hold her fast, and, altered, loves unaltered
1145	metamorphoses	"’
"
1146	metamorphoses	She finished speaking: the wonderful tale had charmed their ears
1147	metamorphoses	 Part of them denies it could have happened, part says that the true gods can do anything
1148	metamorphoses	 Though Bacchus is not one of those
1149	metamorphoses	When the sisters are silent, Alcithoë is called on next
1150	metamorphoses	 Standing there, running her shuttle through the threads on her loom, she said ‘I will say nothing of that well-known story, the love of Daphnis, the Idaean shepherd-boy, whom a nymph, angered by a rival, turned to stone: so great is the pain that inflames lovers
1151	metamorphoses	 Neither will I tell you how, the laws of nature conspiring to alter, Sithon became of indeterminate sex, now man, now woman: how Celmis, you too, now changed to steel, were a most loyal friend to the infant Jupiter: how the Curetes were born from vast showers of rain: how Crocus and Smilax were turned into tiny flowers
1152	metamorphoses	 I will reject all those, and charm your imaginations with a sweet, new story
1153	metamorphoses	Now you will hear where the pool of Salmacis got its bad reputation from, how its enervating waters weaken, and soften the limbs they touch
1154	metamorphoses	 The cause is hidden, but the fountain’s effect is widely known
1155	metamorphoses	 The Naiads nursed a child born of Hermes, and a goddess, Cytherean Aphrodite, in Mount Ida’s caves
1156	metamorphoses	 His features were such that, in them, both mother and father could be seen: and from them he took his name, Hermaphroditus
1157	metamorphoses	When he was fifteen years old, he left his native mountains and Ida, his nursery, delighted to wander in unknown lands, and gaze at unknown rivers, his enthusiasm making light of travel
1158	metamorphoses	 He even reached the Lycian cities, and the Carians by Lycia
1159	metamorphoses	 Here he saw a pool of water, clear to its very depths
1160	metamorphoses	 There were no marsh reeds round it, no sterile sedge, no spikes of rushes: it is crystal liquid
1161	metamorphoses	 The edges of the pool are bordered by fresh turf, and the grass is always green
1162	metamorphoses	 A nymph lives there, but she is not skilled for the chase, or used to flexing the bow, or the effort of running, the only Naiad not known by swift-footed Diana
1163	metamorphoses	Often, it’s said, her sisters would tell her “Salmacis, take up the hunting-spear or the painted quiver and vary your idleness with some hard work, hunting!” But she takes up neither the hunting spear nor the painted quiver, and will not vary her idleness with the hardship of hunting
1164	metamorphoses	 She only bathes her shapely limbs in the pool, often combs out her hair, with a comb that is made of boxwood from Cytorus, and looks in the water to see what suits it best
1165	metamorphoses	 Then draped in a translucent robe, she lies down on the soft leaves, or in the soft grass
1166	metamorphoses	 Often she gathers flowers
1167	metamorphoses	 And she was also busy gathering them, then, when she saw the boy, and what she saw she longed to have
1168	metamorphoses	"’
"
1169	metamorphoses	‘She did not go near him yet, though she was quick to go to him, waiting until she had calmed herself, checked her appearance, composed her expression, and merited being seen as beautiful
1170	metamorphoses	 Then she began to say “Youth, O most worthy to be thought a god, if you are a god, you must be Cupid, or, if you are mortal, whoever engendered you is blessed, and any brother of yours is happy, any sister fortunate, if you have sisters, and even the nurse who suckled you at her breast
1171	metamorphoses	 But far beyond them, and far more blessed is she, if there is a she, promised to you, whom you think worthy of marriage
1172	metamorphoses	 If there is someone, let mine be a stolen pleasure, if not, I will be the one, and let us enter into marriage together
1173	metamorphoses	"”
"
1174	metamorphoses	After this the naiad was silent
1175	metamorphoses	 A red flush branded the boy’s face
1176	metamorphoses	 He did not know what love was: though the blush was very becoming
1177	metamorphoses	 Apples are tinged with this colour, hanging in a sunlit tree, or ivory painted with red, or the moon, eclipsed, blushing in her brightness, while the bronze shields clash, in vain, to rescue her
1178	metamorphoses	 The nymph begged endlessly, at least a sister’s kiss, and, about to throw her arms round his ivory-white neck, he said “Stop this, or shall I go, and leave this place, and you?” Salmacis, afraid, turning away, pretended to go, saying, “I freely surrender this place to you, be my guest
1179	metamorphoses	” But she still looked back, and hid herself among bushes in the secluded woods, on her bended knees
1180	metamorphoses	 But he, obviously at leisure, as if unobserved, walks here and there on the grass and playfully, at the end of his walk, dips his feet and ankles in the pool
1181	metamorphoses	 Then, quickly captured by the coolness of the enticing water, he stripped the soft clothes from his slender body
1182	metamorphoses	Then she was truly pleased
1183	metamorphoses	 And Salmacis was inflamed with desire for his naked form
1184	metamorphoses	 The nymph’s eyes blazed with passion, as when Phoebus’s likeness is reflected from a mirror, that opposes his brightest unclouded orb
1185	metamorphoses	 She can scarcely wait, scarcely contain her delight, now longing to hold him, now unable to keep her love to herself
1186	metamorphoses	 He, clapping his open palms to his side, dives into the pool, and leading with one arm and then the other, he gleams through the pure water, as if one sheathed an ivory statue, or bright lilies behind clear glass
1187	metamorphoses	 “I have won, he is mine”, the naiad cries, and flinging aside all her garments, she throws herself into the midst of the water
1188	metamorphoses	She held him to her, struggling, snatching kisses from the fight, putting her hands beneath him, touching his unwilling breast, overwhelming the youth from this side and that
1189	metamorphoses	 At last, she entwines herself face to face with his beauty, like a snake, lifted by the king of birds and caught up into the air, as Hermaphroditus tries to slip away
1190	metamorphoses	 Hanging there she twines round his head and feet and entangles his spreading wings in her coils
1191	metamorphoses	 Or as ivy often interlaces tall tree trunks
1192	metamorphoses	 Or as the cuttlefish holds the prey, it has surprised, underwater, wrapping its tentacles everywhere
1193	metamorphoses	The descendant of Atlas holds out, denying the nymph’s wished-for pleasure: she hugs him, and clings, as though she is joined to his whole body
1194	metamorphoses	 “It is right to struggle, perverse one,” she says, “but you will still not escape
1195	metamorphoses	 Grant this, you gods, that no day comes to part me from him, or him from me
1196	metamorphoses	” Her prayer reached the gods
1197	metamorphoses	 Now the entwined bodies of the two were joined together, and one form covered both
1198	metamorphoses	 Just as when someone grafts a twig into the bark, they see both grow joined together, and develop as one, so when they were mated together in a close embrace, they were not two, but a two-fold form, so that they could not be called male or female, and seemed neither or either
1199	metamorphoses	When he saw now that the clear waters which he had penetrated as a man, had made him a creature of both sexes, and his limbs had been softened there, Hermaphroditus, stretching out his hands, said, but not in a man’s voice, “Father and mother, grant this gift to your son, who bears both your names: whoever comes to these fountains as a man, let him leave them half a man, and weaken suddenly at the touch of these waters!” Both his parents moved by this, granted the prayer of their twin-formed son, and contaminated the pool with a damaging drug
1200	metamorphoses	"’
"
1201	metamorphoses	The story was finished, and the daughters of Minyas still pressed on with their work, spurning the god and profaning his festival, when suddenly harsh sounds sprang up from unseen drums, pipes with curved horns sounded, and cymbals clashed
1202	metamorphoses	 Saffron and myrrh perfumed the air, and unbelievably their looms began to grow like greenwood, the cloth they were weaving put out leaves of hanging ivy, part altered to vines, and what were once threads changed into tendrils: vine shoots came out of the warp, and clusters of dark-coloured grapes took on the splendour of the purple fabric
1203	metamorphoses	Now the day was past, and the time had come when you could not say that it was light or darkness, but a borderland of light and uncertain night
1204	metamorphoses	 Suddenly the ceiling shook, the oil lamps seemed to brighten, and the house to shine with glowing fires, and fill with the howling of fierce creatures’ deceptive phantoms
1205	metamorphoses	 Quickly the sisters hide in the smoke-filled house, and, in various places, shun the flames and light
1206	metamorphoses	 While they seek the shadows, a thin membrane stretches over their slender limbs, and delicate wings enfold their arms
1207	metamorphoses	 The darkness prevents them knowing how they have lost their former shape
1208	metamorphoses	 They do not rise on soft plumage, but lift themselves on semi-transparent wings, and trying to speak emit the tiniest squeak, as befits their bodies, and tell their grief in faint shrieks
1209	metamorphoses	 They frequent rafters, rather than woods, and, hating the light, they fly at night, and derive their name, ‘vespertiliones’, from ‘vesper’, the evening
1210	metamorphoses	Then indeed Bacchus’s divinity was spoken of throughout Thebes, and Ino, his mother’s sister, told about the new god’s great powers, everywhere
1211	metamorphoses	 Of all her sisters she was the only one free from trouble, except that which her sisters made
1212	metamorphoses	 Juno considered this woman, and the lofty pride she had in her sons, her marriage to King Athamas, and her foster-child Bacchus, and could not bear it
1213	metamorphoses	 She said, to herself, ‘That son of my rival could change the Maeonian sailors, and immerse them in the sea, and give the flesh of a child to be torn in pieces, by his own mother, and enfold the three daughters of Minyas in strange wings
1214	metamorphoses	 Can Juno do nothing except lament her troubles, un-avenged? Is that enough for me? Is that my only power? He teaches me what to do (it is possible to learn from the enemy): he has shown enough, and more than enough, of the power madness has, by the killing of Pentheus
1215	metamorphoses	" Why should Ino not be tormented, and follow her relatives’ example in her madness?’
"
1216	metamorphoses	There is a downward path, gloomy with fatal yew trees: it leads through dumb silence to the infernal regions
1217	metamorphoses	 The sluggish Styx exhales vapour, and, by that way, the shadows of the newly dead descend, entombed with full rites, and the ghosts of those, at last, given proper burial
1218	metamorphoses	 The wide, thorny waste is cold and pallid, and the newly arrived shades are ignorant of the road that leads to the Stygian city, where black Dis has his cruel palace
1219	metamorphoses	 The roomy city has a thousand entrances, and open gates on every side, and as the ocean accepts the rivers of all the world, so this place accepts all the souls, and is never too small for any populace, nor notices the crowds that come
1220	metamorphoses	 There the bloodless shadows wander without flesh or bone
1221	metamorphoses	 Some crowd the forum, some the house of the ruler of the depths, others follow their trades, imitating their previous lives, and still others incur punishment
1222	metamorphoses	Leaving her place in heaven, Saturnian Juno endured the journey there, giving in to such a degree to anger and hatred
1223	metamorphoses	 As soon as she entered and the threshold sighed at the touch of her sacred body, Cerberus lifted his triple head and let out his threefold baying
1224	metamorphoses	 She called out for the dread, implacable Furies, the Sisters, the children of Night
1225	metamorphoses	 They sat in front of the prison gates, closed with steel, combing out their hair, of black snakes
1226	metamorphoses	 The goddesses rose together, recognising her shadow in the darkness
1227	metamorphoses	 The place is called Accursed
1228	metamorphoses	 Here Tityos offers up his innards to be torn, stretched out over nine fields
1229	metamorphoses	 You, Tantalus, cannot catch the drops of water, and the tree you grasp at, eludes you
1230	metamorphoses	 You, Sisyphus, attack or pursue the stone that always returns
1231	metamorphoses	 Ixion turns, and follows after himself and flees, and the forty-nine Belides, who dared to plot the destruction of their cousins, their husbands, fetch again, with incessant labour, the water they have lost
1232	metamorphoses	After Saturnia had looked grimly, glancing fiercely, at all these, and at Ixion above all, looking back from him to Sisyphus, she asks the Furies ‘Why does this son of Aeolus, suffer perpetual torment, while his brother Athamas, who, with his wife, scorns me, lives, in his pride, in a rich palace?’ And she expounds the causes of her hatred, her journey, and what it is she wishes
1233	metamorphoses	 What she wished was that the House of Cadmus should no longer stand, and that the Sisters should drive Athamas mad
1234	metamorphoses	 She urged the goddesses help, mingling promises, commands and prayers together
1235	metamorphoses	 When Juno had finished speaking, Tisiphone, grey-haired as she was, shook her locks, flinging back the snakes that concealed her face, and said ‘It does not need all these words: consider it done, whatever you have ordered
1236	metamorphoses	 Leave this unlovely kingdom, and go back to heaven with its sweeter air
1237	metamorphoses	’ Juno returned happily, and Iris, her messenger, the daughter of Thaumus, purified her, as she was about to enter heaven, with drops of dew
1238	metamorphoses	Without delay, Tisiphone, the troubler, grasped a torch soaked with blood, put on a dripping red robe, coiled a writhing serpent round her waist, and left the spot
1239	metamorphoses	 Grief went as her companion, and Panic, and Terror, and Madness with agitated face
1240	metamorphoses	 She took up her position on the threshold, and they say the pillars of the doorway of Aeolus’s palace shook, the doors of maple-wood were tainted with whiteness, and the sun fled the place
1241	metamorphoses	 Athamas and his wife, Ino, were terrified at these portents of doom, and they tried to escape the palace
1242	metamorphoses	 The baleful Erinys obstructed them, and blocked the way
1243	metamorphoses	 Stretching out her arms, wreathed with knots of vipers, she flailed her hair, and the snakes hissed at her movements
1244	metamorphoses	 Some coiled over her shoulders, some slid over her breast, giving out whistling noises, vomiting blood, and flickering their tongues
1245	metamorphoses	Then she pulls two serpents from the midst of her hair, and hurls what she has snatched with a deadly aim
1246	metamorphoses	 They slither over Ino and Athamas, and blow their oppressive breath into them
1247	metamorphoses	 Their limbs are not wounded: it is the mind that feels the dreadful stroke
1248	metamorphoses	 She had brought foul poisonous liquids too, spume from the jaws of Cerberus, Echidna’s venom, those that cause vague delusions, dark oblivions of the mind, wickedness and weeping, rage and love of murder, all seethed together
1249	metamorphoses	 She had boiled them, mixed with fresh blood, in hollow bronze, stirred with a stalk of green hemlock
1250	metamorphoses	While they stood trembling, she poured this venom of the Furies over the breasts of the two of them, and sent it into the depths of their minds
1251	metamorphoses	 Then, brandishing her torch, encircled them with fire, by fire’s swift movement, whirling it round in repeated orbit
1252	metamorphoses	 So having conquered them, and carried out her orders, she returned to the wide kingdom of mighty Dis, and unloosed the serpent she had wrapped around her
1253	metamorphoses	Then Athamas, raving through the centre of his palace, cries out ‘Friends, spread the nets through these woods! I have just seen a lioness here, with her two cubs’ and in his madness he followed his wife’s steps as if she were a wild beast
1254	metamorphoses	 Then he snatched his son Learchus, who was laughing and waving his little arms, from his mother’s protection, and whirled him round, two or three times, in the air, in the manner of a sling, and dashed the infant’s head fiercely against the solid rock
1255	metamorphoses	 Then the mother, roused at last by the pain this caused, or by reason of the poison sprinkled on her, howled like an animal, and fled, insanely, tearing at her hair
1256	metamorphoses	 In her naked arms she carried you, Melicertes, and cried out ‘Euhoe, Bacchus’
1257	metamorphoses	" Juno laughed aloud at Bacchus’s name, saying ‘Such help as this may your foster-son give you!’
"
1258	metamorphoses	A cliff overhung the water, carved out at its base by the breakers, and it sheltered the waves it hid, from the rain
1259	metamorphoses	 Its summit reared up and stretched out, in front, over the water, into empty space
1260	metamorphoses	 Ino climbed up there (madness had lent her strength) and unrestrained by fear threw herself and her burden into the sea: the wave foamed white where she fell
1261	metamorphoses	 Venus, pitying her granddaughter’s undeserved sufferings, coaxed her uncle, saying ‘O Neptune, god of the waters, whose power only ceases near heaven, it’s true that what I ask is great, but take pity on those who are mine, whom you see, fallen into the vast Ionian waters, and add them to your sea-gods
1262	metamorphoses	 Some kindness is due me from the sea, if once I was made from the spume in the midst of the deep, and from that my Greek name, ‘foam-born’ Aphrodite, remains
1263	metamorphoses	’ Neptune accepted her prayer, and taking from them what was mortal, gave them greatness, giving them at the same time new names and forms, calling the god Palaemon, and his mother, Leucothoë, the white goddess
1264	metamorphoses	Ino’s Sidonian attendants followed the marks of her feet as best they could, only to see her last leap from the pinnacle of rock
1265	metamorphoses	 Not doubting that she was dead, they mourned for the House of Cadmus, beating their breasts, tearing at their clothes and hair, saying that the goddess had shown too little justice, and too much cruelty, to the rival who had made her jealous
1266	metamorphoses	 Juno could not bear their protests, and said ‘I will make you the best monument to my cruelty’
1267	metamorphoses	 What she said was done
1268	metamorphoses	 Now the one who had been most faithful cried ‘I will follow the queen into the sea’, and starting her leap could not move at all, and stuck fast, fixed to the cliff
1269	metamorphoses	 Another felt her raised arms grow rigid, when she tried to beat her breasts, as she had been doing
1270	metamorphoses	 Another chanced to stretch her hands out to the waves of the sea, but now hands made of stone were extended over the same waves
1271	metamorphoses	 One, as she tore at the crown of her head to pull out her hair, you might see, suddenly with stiffened fingers amongst her hair
1272	metamorphoses	 Whatever gesture they were caught in, there they remained
1273	metamorphoses	 Others, Theban women, changed to birds, also, now, skim the surface of those depths with their wings
1274	metamorphoses	The son of Agenor, Cadmus, did not know that his daughter and little grandson were now sea-gods
1275	metamorphoses	 Conquered by the pain of this run of disasters, and daunted by all he had seen, the founder departed his city, as if the misfortunes of the place and not himself were oppressing him
1276	metamorphoses	 Driven to wandering, at length his journey carried him and his wife to the borders of Illyria
1277	metamorphoses	 Now, weighed down by age and sadness, they thought of the original destiny of their house, and in talk reviewed their sufferings
1278	metamorphoses	 Cadmus said ‘Surely that snake my spear pierced, must have been sacred, when, fresh from Sidon, I scattered the serpent’s teeth, a strange seed, over the earth? If that is what the gods have been avenging with such sure anger, may I myself stretch out as a long-bellied snake
1279	metamorphoses	’ And, so speaking, he did extend into a long-bellied snake, and felt his skin hardening as scales grew there, while dark green patches chequered his black body
1280	metamorphoses	 He lay prone on his breast, and gradually his legs fused together thinning out towards a smooth point
1281	metamorphoses	 Still his arms were left to him, and what was left of his arms he stretched out, and, with tears running down his still human cheeks, he said ‘Come here, wife, come here, most unfortunate one, and while there is still something left of me, touch me, and take my hand, while it is still a hand, while the snake does not yet have all of me
1282	metamorphoses	"’
"
1283	metamorphoses	He wanted to say so much more, but suddenly his tongue was split in two, and though he wished for words none came, and whenever he started on some plaintive sound, he hissed: this was the voice that Nature bequeathed him
1284	metamorphoses	 Then, striking her naked breast with her hands, his wife cried out ‘Cadmus, wait, unhappy one, tear away this monstrous thing! Cadmus, what is it? Where are your feet? Where are your hands, shoulders, face, colour, everything – while I speak? Why do you not change me as well, you gods, into this same snake’s form?’ She spoke
1285	metamorphoses	 His tongue flickered over his wife’s face, he slid between her beloved breasts as if known there, and clasped her, and searched about for the neck he knew so well
1286	metamorphoses	 Everyone who was there (their comrades were present) was horrified, but she stroked the gleaming neck of the crested serpent, and suddenly there were two snakes there, with intertwining coils, until they sought the shelter of the neighbouring woods
1287	metamorphoses	 Even now they do not avoid human beings or wound them, quiet serpents, remembering what they once were
1288	metamorphoses	Nevertheless even in their altered form, their grandson Bacchus gave them great consolation, whom conquered India worshipped, to whose newly created temples the Achaians thronged
1289	metamorphoses	 Only Acrisius, son of Abas, born from the same roots (through Belus brother of Agenor), was an exception, who closed Argos within its walls, took up arms against the god, and did not consider him a child of Jupiter
1290	metamorphoses	 Nor did he consider, as a child of Jupiter, his grandson Perseus whom Danaë conceived of a shower of gold
1291	metamorphoses	 Though later (such is truth’s power) Acrisius repented of outraging the god, and of not acknowledging his grandson
1292	metamorphoses	 One had taken his place in the heavens, but the other was travelling through the gentle air, on beating wings, bringing back an amazing, monstrous prize, and as the victor hung above the Libyan sands, bloody drops fell from the Gorgon’s head
1293	metamorphoses	 The earth caught them and gave them life, as species of snakes, and so that country is infested with deadly serpents
1294	metamorphoses	He was driven from there by conflicting winds, carried this way and that, through vast spaces, like a rain cloud
1295	metamorphoses	 He flew over the whole world, looking down, through the air, from a great height at remote countries
1296	metamorphoses	 Three times he saw the frozen constellations of the Bears, three times the Crab’s pincers
1297	metamorphoses	 Often he was forced below the west, often into the east, and now as the light died, afraid to trust to night, he put down in the western regions of Hesperus, in the kingdom of Atlas
1298	metamorphoses	 He looked to rest there a while, till Lucifer summoned up Aurora’s fires, and Aurora the chariot of dawn
1299	metamorphoses	 Here was Atlas, son of Iapetus, exceeding all men by the size of his body
1300	metamorphoses	The most remote land was under Atlas’s rule, and the ocean, into which Sol’s panting horses plunged, and where his straining axle was welcomed
1301	metamorphoses	 He had a thousand flocks, and as many herds of cattle straying through the grass, and no neighbouring soil was richer than his
1302	metamorphoses	 The leaves of the trees, bright with radiant gold, covered branches of gold, and fruit of gold
1303	metamorphoses	 Perseus said to him ‘Friend, if high birth impresses you, Jupiter is responsible for my birth
1304	metamorphoses	 Or if you admire great deeds, you will admire mine
1305	metamorphoses	 I ask for hospitality and rest
1306	metamorphoses	"’
"
1307	metamorphoses	Atlas remembered an ancient prophecy
1308	metamorphoses	 Themis on Parnassus had given that prophecy
1309	metamorphoses	 ‘Atlas, the time will come when your tree will be stripped of its gold, and he who steals it will be called the son of Jupiter
1310	metamorphoses	’ Fearful of this, Atlas had enclosed his orchard with solid walls, and set a huge dragon to guard it, and kept all strangers away from his borders
1311	metamorphoses	 To Perseus, he said ‘Go far away, lest the glory of the deeds, that you lie about, and Jupiter himself, fail you!’ He added weight to his threats, and tried to push him away with his great hands, Perseus delaying resolutely, and combining that with calm words
1312	metamorphoses	 Inferior in strength (who could equal Atlas in strength?), he said, ‘Well now, since you show me so little kindness, accept a gift’ and turning away himself, he held out Medusa’s foul head, on his left hand side
1313	metamorphoses	 Atlas became a mountain, as huge as he himself had been
1314	metamorphoses	 Now his hair and beard were changed into trees, his shoulders and hands into ridges
1315	metamorphoses	 What had been his head before was the crest on the mountain summit
1316	metamorphoses	 His bones became stones
1317	metamorphoses	 Then he grew to an immense height in every part (so you gods determined) and the whole sky, with its many stars, rested on him
1318	metamorphoses	Aeolus, son of Hippotas, had confined the winds in their prison under Mount Etna, and Lucifer, who exhorts us to work, shone brightest of all in the depths of the eastern sky
1319	metamorphoses	 Perseus strapped the winged sandals he had put to one side to his feet, armed himself with his curved sword, and cut through the clear air on beating pinions
1320	metamorphoses	 Leaving innumerable nations behind, below and around him, he came in sight of the Ethiopian peoples, and the fields of Cepheus
1321	metamorphoses	 There Jupiter Ammon had unjustly ordered the innocent Andromeda to pay the penalty for her mother Cassiopeia’s words
1322	metamorphoses	As soon as Perseus, great-grandson of Abas, saw her fastened by her arms to the hard rock, he would have thought she was a marble statue, except that a light breeze stirred her hair, and warm tears ran from her eyes
1323	metamorphoses	 He took fire without knowing it and was stunned, and seized by the vision of the form he saw, he almost forgot to flicker his wings in the air
1324	metamorphoses	 As soon as he had touched down, he said ‘O, you do not deserve these chains, but those that link ardent lovers together
1325	metamorphoses	 Tell me your name, I wish to know it, and the name of your country, and why you are wearing these fetters
1326	metamorphoses	 At first she was silent: a virgin, she did not dare to address a man, and she would have hidden her face modestly with her hands, if they had not been fastened behind her
1327	metamorphoses	 She used her eyes instead, and they filled with welling tears
1328	metamorphoses	 At his repeated insistence, so as not to seem to be acknowledging a fault of her own, she told him her name and the name of her country, and what faith her mother had had in her own beauty
1329	metamorphoses	Before she had finished speaking, all the waves resounded, and a monster menaced them, rising from the deep sea, and covered the wide waters with its breadth
1330	metamorphoses	 The girl cried out: her grieving father and mother were together nearby, both wretched, but the mother more justifiably so
1331	metamorphoses	 They bring no help with them, only weeping and lamentations to suit the moment, and cling to her fettered body
1332	metamorphoses	 Then the stranger speaks ‘There will be plenty of time left for tears, but only a brief hour is given us to work
1333	metamorphoses	 If I asked for this girl as Perseus, son of Jupiter and that Danaë, imprisoned in the brazen tower, whom Jupiter filled with his rich golden shower; Perseus conqueror of the Gorgon with snakes for hair, he who dared to fly, driven through the air, on soaring wings, then surely I should be preferred to all other suitors as a son-in-law
1334	metamorphoses	 If the gods favour me, I will try to add further merit to these great gifts
1335	metamorphoses	 I will make a bargain
1336	metamorphoses	 Rescued by my courage, she must be mine
1337	metamorphoses	’ Her parents accept the contract (who would hesitate?) and, entreating him, promise a kingdom, as well, for a dowry
1338	metamorphoses	See how the creature comes, parting the waves with surging breast, like a fast ship with pointed prow ploughing the water, driven by the sweat-covered muscles of her crew
1339	metamorphoses	 It was as far from the rock as a Balearic sling can send a lead shot through the air, when suddenly the young hero, pushing his feet hard against the earth, shot high among the clouds
1340	metamorphoses	 When the shadow of a man appeared on the water’ surface, the creature raged against the shadow it had seen
1341	metamorphoses	 As Jupiter’s eagle, when it sees a snake, in an open field, showing its livid body to the sun, takes it from behind, and fixes its eager talons in the scaly neck, lest it twists back its cruel fangs, so the descendant of Inachus hurling himself headlong, in swift flight, through empty space, attacked the creature’s back, and, as it roared, buried his sword, to the end of the curved blade, in the right side of its neck
1342	metamorphoses	 Hurt by the deep wound, now it reared high in the air, now it dived underwater, or turned now, like a fierce wild boar, when the dogs scare him, and the pack is baying around him
1343	metamorphoses	 Perseus evades the eager jaws on swift wings, and strikes with his curved sword wherever the monster is exposed, now at the back encrusted with barnacles, now at the sides of the body, now where the tail is slenderest, ending fishlike
1344	metamorphoses	 The beast vomits seawater mixed with purplish blood
1345	metamorphoses	 The pinions grow heavy, soaked with spray
1346	metamorphoses	 Not daring to trust his drenched wings any further, he sees a rock whose highest point stands above quiet water, hidden by rough seas
1347	metamorphoses	 Resting there, and holding on to the topmost pinnacle with his left hand, he drives his sword in three or four times, repeatedly
1348	metamorphoses	The shores, and the high places of the gods, fill with the clamour of applause
1349	metamorphoses	 Cassiope and Cepheus rejoice, and greet their son-in-law, acknowledging him as the pillar of their house, and their deliverer
1350	metamorphoses	 Released from her chains, the girl comes forward, the prize and the cause of his efforts
1351	metamorphoses	 He washes his hands after the victory in seawater drawn for him, and, so that Medusa’s head, covered with its snakes, is not bruised by the harsh sand, he makes the ground soft with leaves, and spreads out plants from below the waves, and places the head of that daughter of Phorcys on them
1352	metamorphoses	 The fresh plants, still living inside, and absorbent, respond to the influence of the Gorgon’s head, and harden at its touch, acquiring a new rigidity in branches and fronds
1353	metamorphoses	 And the ocean nymphs try out this wonder on more plants, and are delighted that the same thing happens at its touch, and repeat it by scattering the seeds from the plants through the waves
1354	metamorphoses	 Even now corals have the same nature, hardening at a touch of air, and what was alive, under the water, above water is turned to stone
1355	metamorphoses	To the three gods, he builds the same number of altars out of turf, to you Mercury on the left, to you Minerva, warlike virgin, on the right, and an altar of Jupiter in the centre
1356	metamorphoses	 He sacrifices a cow to Minerva, a calf to the wing-footed god, and a bull to you, greatest of the gods
1357	metamorphoses	 Then he claims Andromeda, without a dowry, valuing her as the worthiest prize
1358	metamorphoses	 Hymen and Amor wave the marriage torch, the fires are saturated with strong perfumes, garlands hang from the rafters, and everywhere flutes and pipes, and singing, sound out, the happy evidence of joyful hearts
1359	metamorphoses	 The doors fold back to show the whole of the golden hall, and the noble Ethiopian princes enter to a richly prepared banquet already set out for them
1360	metamorphoses	When they have attacked the feast, and their spirits are cheered by wine, the generous gift of Bacchus, Perseus asks about the country and its culture, its customs and the character of its people
1361	metamorphoses	 At the same time as he instructed him about these, one of the guests said ‘Perseus, I beg you to tell us by what prowess and by what arts you carried off that head with snakes for hair
1362	metamorphoses	’ The descendant of Agenor told how there was a cave lying below the frozen slopes of Atlas, safely hidden in its solid mass
1363	metamorphoses	 At the entrance to this place the sisters lived, the Graeae, daughters of Phorcys, similar in appearance, sharing only one eye between them
1364	metamorphoses	 He removed it, cleverly, and stealthily, cunningly substituting his own hand while they were passing it from one to another
1365	metamorphoses	 Far from there, by hidden tracks, and through rocks bristling with shaggy trees, he reached the place where the Gorgons lived
1366	metamorphoses	 In the fields and along the paths, here and there, he saw the shapes of men and animals changed from their natures to hard stone by Medusa’s gaze
1367	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless he had himself looked at the dread form of Medusa reflected in a circular shield of polished bronze that he carried on his left arm
1368	metamorphoses	 And while a deep sleep held the snakes and herself, he struck her head from her neck
1369	metamorphoses	 And the swift winged horse Pegasus and his brother the warrior Chrysaor, were born from their mother’s blood
1370	metamorphoses	He told of his long journeys, of dangers that were not imaginary ones, what seas and lands he had seen below from his high flight, and what stars he had brushed against with beating wings
1371	metamorphoses	 He still finished speaking before they wished
1372	metamorphoses	 Next one of the many princes asked why Medusa, alone among her sisters, had snakes twining in her hair
1373	metamorphoses	 The guest replied ‘Since what you ask is worth the telling, hear the answer to your question
1374	metamorphoses	 She was once most beautiful, and the jealous aspiration of many suitors
1375	metamorphoses	 Of all her beauties none was more admired than her hair: I came across a man who recalled having seen her
1376	metamorphoses	 They say that Neptune, lord of the seas, violated her in the temple of Minerva
1377	metamorphoses	 Jupiter’s daughter turned away, and hid her chaste eyes behind her aegis
1378	metamorphoses	 So that it might not go unpunished, she changed the Gorgon’s hair to foul snakes
1379	metamorphoses	 And now, to terrify her enemies, numbing them with fear, the goddess wears the snakes, that she created, as a breastplate
1380	metamorphoses	"’
"
1381	metamorphoses	While the hero, the son of Danae, is recalling this succession of events, amongst the Ethiopians, the royal halls suddenly fill with a riot of complaints
1382	metamorphoses	 It is not the sound of a wedding feast that rings out, but that which presages the use of arms
1383	metamorphoses	 The festivities, turned to sudden confusion, could be likened to a calm sea that the fierce raging of the wind churns into rising waves
1384	metamorphoses	 Phineus, the king’s brother, is first mover in this, a rash stirrer-up of strife, shaking his ashen spear tipped with bronze
1385	metamorphoses	 ‘See,’ he shouted ‘See, I come here as an avenger for the carrying off of my bride
1386	metamorphoses	" Your wings won’t help you escape me, nor even Jupiter, changed to a shower of fool’s gold!’ 
"
1387	metamorphoses	As he prepared to throw the spear, Cepheus cried ‘What are you doing? Brother, what mad feelings drive you to crime? Are these the thanks you return for such service? Is this the gift with which you pay compensation for a life restored? If you want the truth it was not Perseus who took her from you, but Neptune, the stern god of the Nereids, and horned Jupiter Ammon, and that monster that came from the sea to glut itself on my own flesh and blood
1388	metamorphoses	 It was then she was taken from you, when she was about to die: but perhaps, hard-hearted one, that is what you want, for her to die, and you to take comfort from my grief
1389	metamorphoses	 Of course, it is not enough that you saw her fastened there, and brought her no help, you her uncle and her intended
1390	metamorphoses	 Are you grieved that she was saved by someone else, and would you take away his prize? If it seemed so great a prize to you, you should have sought her among the rocks where she was chained
1391	metamorphoses	 Now let the man who did seek it, take what he has earned and what was promised, since, thanks to him, I shall not have a childless old age
1392	metamorphoses	 Realise that it is not Perseus, but the prospect of certain death that has displaced you
1393	metamorphoses	"’
"
1394	metamorphoses	Phineus said nothing, but turned his face alternately from Perseus to his brother, not knowing whether to aim at the one or the other
1395	metamorphoses	 Hesitating for a while he hurled his spear, throwing it with the energy of anger, but uselessly, at Perseus
1396	metamorphoses	 Only when it had stuck fast in the bench, did Perseus leap up from where he was lying
1397	metamorphoses	 Returning the weapon, fiercely, he would have pierced his enemy’s chest, if Phineus had not dodged behind the altars: and (shamefully) the wretch found safety in that refuge
1398	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless the javelin was not without effect, and struck Rhoetus full face, who immediately fell, and, when the weapon had been pulled out of the bone, he kicked out and sprayed the laden tables with his blood
1399	metamorphoses	 Then the crowd of men was truly ablaze with anger, and they hurled their spears, and there were those who said Cepheus deserved to die with his son-in-law
1400	metamorphoses	 But Cepheus had already crossed the threshold, calling on justice, good faith, and on the gods of friendship, to witness that what was being done was forbidden
1401	metamorphoses	 Warlike Pallas came and protected her brother, Perseus, with her shield, the aegis, and gave him courage
1402	metamorphoses	There was a youth from India, Athis, whom Limnaee, a nymph of the River Ganges is said to have given birth to, under its glassy waters
1403	metamorphoses	 He was of outstanding beauty, his sixteen years unimpaired, enhanced by his rich robes, wearing his military cloak of Tyrian purple, fringed with gold
1404	metamorphoses	 A gold collar ornamented his neck, and a curved coronet his myrrh-drenched hair
1405	metamorphoses	 He was skilled at piercing anything with the javelins he launched, however distant, but was even more skilled at shooting with the bow
1406	metamorphoses	 While he was bending the pliant tips in his hands, Perseus struck him, with a log that had been smouldering in the middle of the altar, and shattered his face to splintered bone
1407	metamorphoses	When Lycabas, the Assyrian, closest to him, as a friend, and, most probably, a lover, saw his much praised features masked with blood, he wept bitterly for Athis, breathing out his life through that sad wound
1408	metamorphoses	 He caught up the bow Athis had strung and said ‘Now match yourself with me! You will not have long to rejoice over the death of a child, an act which holds more shame than praise
1409	metamorphoses	’ He had not finished speaking when the sharp arrow shot from the bowstring, but Perseus avoided it, and it was left hanging from a fold of his clothes
1410	metamorphoses	 The grandson of Acrisius turned against him that scimitar, tried and proven in his killing of Medusa, driving it into his chest
1411	metamorphoses	 But even in death, his eyes failing, he looked round for Athis, in that gloomy night, and fell next to him, taking for his solace, to the shadows, the fact of being joined with him in death
1412	metamorphoses	Phorbas of Syene, the son of Metion, and Libyan Amphimedon, eager to commit to the fight, fell, having slipped on the ground, warm and drenched with blood on every side
1413	metamorphoses	 Rising, they were stopped by the sword, piercing Phorbas’s throat, and Amphimedon’s ribs
1414	metamorphoses	 But Perseus did not challenge Eurytus, son of Actor, who had a battle-axe, with his scimitar, instead, lifting a mixing bowl, embossed with decorations and very heavy in weight, high in the air, with both hands, he dashed it down on the man, who vomited bright red blood, and, lying on his back, beat the earth with his head
1415	metamorphoses	 Then Perseus overthrew Polydegmon, born of the blood of Queen Semiramis, Abaris from Caucasia, Lycetus from the River Spercheos region, Helices with flowing hair, Clytus and Phlegyas, and trod on a mounting pile of the dying
1416	metamorphoses	Phineus did not dare to fight hand to hand with his enemy, but threw his spear, which felled Idas, by mistake, who, though unavailingly, had no part in the fight, and was a follower of neither side
1417	metamorphoses	 He, looking fiercely at Phineus, said ‘Since I have been forced to take part, then, Phineus, acknowledge the enemy you have made, and repay me wound for wound!’ He was about to hurl back the javelin he had pulled from his body when he collapsed dying, his limbs drained of blood
1418	metamorphoses	Then Hodites, the greatest of the Ethiopians next to the king, was killed by Clymenus’s sword
1419	metamorphoses	 Hypseus struck Prothoënor, and Lyncides struck Hypseus
1420	metamorphoses	 One very old man, Emathion, was there who upheld justice, and feared the gods
1421	metamorphoses	 He stepped forward, and since his age prevented him fighting, he warred in words, cursing their sinful weapons
1422	metamorphoses	 Chromis decapitated him with his sword, as he clung to the altar with trembling hands, and the head fell straight on to the hearth, and there the half living tongue still uttered imprecations, and its life expired in the midst of the flames
1423	metamorphoses	Then two brothers fell at the hands of Phineus
1424	metamorphoses	 They were Broteas, and Ammon the famous boxers, who would have been able to overcome anything, if boxing gloves were able to overcome swords, and Ampycus, priest of Ceres, his forehead wreathed with white fillets
1425	metamorphoses	 And you Lampetides, summoned, but not for this purpose, who played the lute and sang the work of peace, ordered to help celebrate the feast, and recite the bridal songs
1426	metamorphoses	 Pedasus, mockingly shouted to him, as he stood to one side holding his unwarlike plectrum, ‘Go and sing the rest to the Stygian shades!’ and pierced his left temple with his blade
1427	metamorphoses	 He fell, and tried to pluck the lyric strings again, with dying fingers, and, falling, struck a plaintive note
1428	metamorphoses	Lycormas, angered, did not allow him to die without taking revenge
1429	metamorphoses	 Grasping a heavy bar from the door on his right, he struck Pedasus, in the middle of his neck-bones, and he fell dead to the ground, like a bullock at the sacrifice
1430	metamorphoses	 Pelates, from the banks of Cinyps, tried to take the bar from the left door, and, while attempting to do so, his right hand was transfixed by the spear of Corythus, from Marmarica, and pinned to the wood
1431	metamorphoses	 Abas pierced him in the side as he was fastened there, and he did not fall, but hung there, dying, from the post to which his hand was nailed
1432	metamorphoses	 Melaneus, a follower of Perseus’s cause, was also killed, and Dorylas, the wealthiest man in the fields of Nasamonia, Dorylas whose wealth was in fields, than whom no man held a greater tract, nor could pile up as many heaps of spices
1433	metamorphoses	 A missile thrown from the side stuck in his groin, that fatal place
1434	metamorphoses	 When Halcyoneus of Bactria, the perpetrator of the wound, saw him gasping for life, his eyes rolling, he said ‘Of all your lands you shall have only this earth you lie on!’ and left his bloodless corpse
1435	metamorphoses	 But Perseus, the avenger, the descendant of Abas, turned against him the spear, pulled hot from the wound
1436	metamorphoses	 Catching the nose, it went through the middle of the neck, jutting out front and back
1437	metamorphoses	While Fortune aided his hand, Perseus killed Clytius and Clanis, born of one mother, with different wounds
1438	metamorphoses	 An ashen spear, from his strong arm, went through both Clytius’s thighs, while Clanis’s jaw bit on a javelin
1439	metamorphoses	 Mendesian Celadon was killed, Astreus, of unknown father and Syrian mother, Aethion, once skilled in telling the future, now deceived by lack of foresight, Thoactes, the armour-bearer of the king, and Agyrtes, notorious for murdering his own father
1440	metamorphoses	There is yet more to be done, despite what he has endured: the purpose of all is to overwhelm this one man
1441	metamorphoses	 The bands of conspirators oppose him on all sides, in a cause opposed to justice, and good faith
1442	metamorphoses	 His father, with helpless loyalty, and his new bride and her mother, support him to the best of their abilities, filling the palace with their cries
1443	metamorphoses	 But the clash of weapons and the groans of the fallen, drown them out, and at the same time Bellona, goddess of war, pollutes and drenches the penates, the household gods, with blood, and stirs renewed conflict
1444	metamorphoses	Phineus and a thousand followers of Phineus, surround the one man
1445	metamorphoses	 Spears to the right of him, spears to the left of him, fly thicker than winter hail, past his eyes and ears
1446	metamorphoses	 He sets his back and shoulders against a massive stone column, and protected behind, turns towards the opposing crowd of men, and withstands their threat
1447	metamorphoses	 The Chaonian, Molpeus, presses him on the left, and on the right Ethemon, a Nabatean
1448	metamorphoses	 Like a tiger, goaded by hunger, that hears the bellowing of two herds of cattle in separate valleys, and does not know which it would rather rush at, fired up to rush at either, so Perseus hesitates whether to strike right or left
1449	metamorphoses	 He drives Molpeus off, piercing him with a wound to the leg, and is content to let him go: but Ethemon allows him no time, and raging and eager to give him a wound high on the neck, flails at him, incautiously and violently, and fractures his sword, striking it on the extreme edge of the column
1450	metamorphoses	 The blade is detached, and fixes itself in its owner’s throat
1451	metamorphoses	 The wound it gives him is not serious enough to cause his death, but as he stands there, quivering, and uselessly stretching out his defenceless arms, Perseus stabs him with Cyllenian Mercury’s curved sword
1452	metamorphoses	When Perseus saw indeed that, his efforts would succumb to the weight of numbers, he said ‘Since you plan it like this, I will ask help of the enemy
1453	metamorphoses	 If there are any friends here, turn your face away!’ and he held up the Gorgon’s head
1454	metamorphoses	 ‘Find others, who might be worried by your marvel’ said Thesculus, but as he prepared to throw his deadly javelin, he was frozen, like a marble statue, in the act
1455	metamorphoses	 Ampyx, next to him, thrust his sword straight at the heart of the courageous descendant of Lynceus, and, in thrusting, his right hand stiffened, without movement this way or that
1456	metamorphoses	 But Nileus who falsely claimed that he was born of the Nile with its seven mouths, his shield engraved with its seven streams, part gold, part silver, cried ‘Perseus, see, the sources of my people: it will be a great consolation to you to take with you, in death, to the silent shadows, the knowledge of having fallen to so noble a man’
1457	metamorphoses	 The last echo of his voice was cut off in mid-flight, and you might believe his mouth still wished to speak, though it was no longer pervious to words
1458	metamorphoses	Eryx rebuked them, saying, ‘Lack of courage, not the power of the Gorgon, freezes you
1459	metamorphoses	 Rush in with me and knock this youth and his magic weapon to the ground!’ He had started his rush, but the floor held his feet fast, and there he stayed, unmoving stone, a fully-armed statue
1460	metamorphoses	They all deserved the punishment they suffered, except one of Perseus’s warriors
1461	metamorphoses	 While he was fighting on his side, Aconteus, saw the Gorgon’s head, and took the shape of hardened stone
1462	metamorphoses	 Astyages struck him with his long sword thinking he was still alive, and the blade gave a high-pitched ringing noise
1463	metamorphoses	 While Astyages stood there amazed, the same power transformed him, and he remained there with a wondering look on his marble face
1464	metamorphoses	 It would take a long time to tell the names of the middle ranks of men: two hundred bodies survived the fight, two hundred bodies were turned to stone, at sight of the Gorgon’s head
1465	metamorphoses	Now, at last, Phineus regrets the unjust fight, but what can he do? He sees the figures in diverse attitudes, and recognises the men, and calling on each by name, asks his help
1466	metamorphoses	 Disbelieving, he touches the bodies nearest to him
1467	metamorphoses	 They are marble
1468	metamorphoses	 He averts his gaze from Perseus, and in supplication, he stretches out his hands in acknowledgement, his arms still held out towards him
1469	metamorphoses	 ‘Perseus’, he cries, ‘you have won! Take away that monstrous thing of yours: remove your head of the Medusa, whoever she may be, that turns men to stone
1470	metamorphoses	 Take it away, I beg you! It was not hate, or desire for power, that drove me to war
1471	metamorphoses	 I took up arms to win a bride! Your claim was greater by merit, but mine by precedence
1472	metamorphoses	 I do not regret ending it
1473	metamorphoses	 Give me nothing, except my life, most resolute of men, the rest is yours!’ So speaking, not daring to look towards him to whom he directed his request, Perseus replied ‘Have no fear, most cowardly Phineus, I will grant both what I can grant, and what is a great gift to the fearful! You will not suffer the sword
1474	metamorphoses	 Rather I will cause you to be an enduring monument through the ages, and you will always be seen in my father-in-law’s palace, so that my wife may find solace in the statue of her intended
1475	metamorphoses	’ He spoke, and carried the head of Phorcys’s daughter to where Phineus had turned his frightened face
1476	metamorphoses	 As Phineus tried to avert his gaze, his neck hardened, and the tears on his cheeks were turned to stone
1477	metamorphoses	 Now the frightened face, the suppliant expression, the submissive hands, and the slavish appearance, remained, in marble
1478	metamorphoses	The victorious descendant of Abas, with his bride, enters Argos, his ancestral city, and as the champion and vindicator of his grandfather Acrisius, who little deserves it, he attacks Proetus, who has made his brother a fugitive by force of arms, and seized his stronghold
1479	metamorphoses	 But neither by force of arms, nor by possession of the stronghold he had taken in his wickedness, could he overcome the fierce gaze of the snake-wreathed monster
1480	metamorphoses	Still, you, O Polydectes, king of tiny Seriphos, softened neither by the young man’s virtue, visible in all his efforts, nor by his suffering, nursed a harsh and unrelenting hatred, and there was no limit to your baseless anger
1481	metamorphoses	 You disparaged the praise given him, and accused his account of the killing of Medusa of being a lie
1482	metamorphoses	 ‘I will give you evidence of its truth
1483	metamorphoses	 Friends, protect your eyes!’ cried Perseus, and with the face of Medusa he turned the face of the king to bloodless stone
1484	metamorphoses	Up to this point Tritonian Minerva had given her time, freely, in friendship, to this brother of hers, conceived in a shower of gold, but now, surrounded by vaulted cloud, she vanished from the island of Seriphos, and leaving Cythnus and Gyarus behind on her right, she headed for Thebes, and Mount Helicon, home of the virgin Muses, crossing the sea by whichever way seemed quickest
1485	metamorphoses	 Reaching it, she alighted there, and spoke to the sisters, learned in song, saying ‘Talk of a new fountain has reached my ears, that gushed out from under the hard hoof of winged Pegasus, born of Medusa
1486	metamorphoses	 That is the reason for my journey
1487	metamorphoses	 I wanted to see this wonderful creation
1488	metamorphoses	 He himself I saw born from his mother’s blood
1489	metamorphoses	"’
"
1490	metamorphoses	Urania replied ‘Whatever reason brings you here, to see our home, goddess, you are dear to our hearts
1491	metamorphoses	 But the tale is true: Pegasus is the source of our fountain’, and she led her to the sacred waters
1492	metamorphoses	 Pallas, having looked in wonder, for a long time, at this stream, made by the blow of the horse’s hoof, gazed around her at the groves of ancient trees, the caves, and the grass, embroidered with innumerable flowers, and said that the daughters of Mnemosyne were equally happy in their home and their pursuits
1493	metamorphoses	 At which one of the sisters answered, ‘O, Tritonia, who would have been one of our choir, if your virtues had not formed you for greater things, what you say is true, and you rightly approve our arts and our haunts
1494	metamorphoses	 Our life is happy, if only it were safe
1495	metamorphoses	 But (nothing is sacred to the wicked), all things frighten virgin minds
1496	metamorphoses	 Dread Pyreneus’s destruction is in front of my eyes, and my mind has not yet recovered fully
1497	metamorphoses	That fierce man had captured Daulis and the Phocian fields, with his Thracian warriors, and wrongly held the kingdom
1498	metamorphoses	 We were heading for the shrine on Parnassus
1499	metamorphoses	 He saw us going by, and his face showing apparent reverence for our divinity, he said (knowing us), “Mnemonides, wait, don’t be afraid, I beg you, to shelter from the rain and the lowering skies” (it was raining): “The gods have often entered humbler homes”
1500	metamorphoses	 Responding to his words, and the weather, we gave the man our assent, and went into the entrance hall of the palace
1501	metamorphoses	 The rain stopped, the north wind overcame the south, and the dark clouds fled from the clearing sky
1502	metamorphoses	 We wished to go
1503	metamorphoses	 Pyreneus closed the doors, and prepared for violence, and we escaped that only by taking to our wings
1504	metamorphoses	 He stood on the highest summit, as if he would follow us, saying “Whatever is your way, is also mine”, and foolishly threw himself from the roof of the main tower
1505	metamorphoses	 He fell headlong, breaking his skull, hammering the ground in dying, and staining the earth with his evil blood
1506	metamorphoses	"’ 
"
1507	metamorphoses	The Muse was speaking: wings sounded in the air, and voices in greeting came out of the high branches
1508	metamorphoses	 The daughter of Jupiter looked up, and questioned where the sound came from, that was so much like mouths speaking, and thought it human, though it was birdsong
1509	metamorphoses	 Nine of them, magpies, that imitate everything, had settled in the branches, bemoaning their fate
1510	metamorphoses	 While she wondered, the other began speaking, goddess to goddess, ‘Defeated in a contest, they have been added only recently to the flocks of birds
1511	metamorphoses	 Pierus of Pella, rich in fields, was their father, and Paeonian Euippe was their mother
1512	metamorphoses	 Nine times, while giving birth, she called, nine times, to powerful Lucina
1513	metamorphoses	 Swollen with pride in their numbers, this crowd of foolish sisters came here, to us, through the many cities of Achaia and Haemonia, and challenged us to a singing competition, saying “Stop cheating the untutored masses with your empty sweetness
1514	metamorphoses	 If you have faith in yourselves, contend with us, you goddesses of Thespiae
1515	metamorphoses	 We cannot be outdone in voice or art, and we are your equals in numbers
1516	metamorphoses	 If you want, if you are defeated, you can grant us the Heliconian fountains, Hippocrene, of Medusa’s offspring, and Boeotian Aganippe
1517	metamorphoses	 Or we will grant you the Emathian plains as far as snow-covered Paeonia! Let the nymphs decide the outcome
1518	metamorphoses	"”
"
1519	metamorphoses	It was shameful to compete with them, but it seemed more shameful to concede
1520	metamorphoses	 The nymphs were elected, and swore on their streams to judge fairly, and sat on platforms of natural rock
1521	metamorphoses	 Then, without drawing lots, the one who had first declared the contest sang, of the war with the gods, granting false honours to the giants, and diminishing the actions of the mighty deities
1522	metamorphoses	 How Typhoeus, issued forth from his abode in the depths of the earth, filling the heavenly gods with fear, and how they all turned their backs in flight, until Egypt received them, and the Nile with its seven mouths
1523	metamorphoses	 She told how earth-born Typhoeus came there as well, and the gods concealed themselves in disguised forms
1524	metamorphoses	 “Jupiter” she said, “turned himself into a ram, the head of the flock, and even now Libyan Ammon is shown with curving horns
1525	metamorphoses	 Delian Apollo hid as a crow, Bacchus, Semele’s child, as a goat, Diana, the sister of Phoebus, a cat, Saturnian Juno a white cow, Venus a fish, and Cyllenian Mercury the winged ibis
1526	metamorphoses	"” 
"
1527	metamorphoses	‘This much she played on her lute, with singing voice
1528	metamorphoses	 Then called on us, - but perhaps you are not at leisure, or free to listen to a repetition of our music?’ ‘Do not stop’ said Pallas, ‘but sing your song again as you arranged it!’ and she sat amongst the light shadows of the grove
1529	metamorphoses	 The Muse renewed her tale ‘We gave our best singer to the contest
1530	metamorphoses	 Calliope, who rose, with her loose hair bound with ivy, tried out the plaintive strings with her fingers, then accompanied the wandering notes with this song
1531	metamorphoses	“Ceres first turned the soil with curving plough, first ripened the crops and produce of the earth, first gave us laws: all things are Ceres’s gift
1532	metamorphoses	 My song is of her
1533	metamorphoses	 If only I could create a song in any way worthy of the goddess! This goddess is truly a worthy subject for my song
1534	metamorphoses	Trinacris, the vast isle of Sicily, had been heaped over the giant’s limbs, and with its great mass oppressed buried Typhoeus, he who had dared to aspire to a place in heaven
1535	metamorphoses	 He struggles it’s true and often tries to rise, but his right hand is held by the promontory of Ausonian Pelorus, and his left hand by you, Pachynus
1536	metamorphoses	 Lilybaeum presses on his legs, Etna weighs down his head, supine beneath it, Typhoeus throws ash from his mouth, and spits out flame
1537	metamorphoses	 Often, a wrestler, he throws back the weight of earth, and tries to roll the high mountains and the cities from his body, and then the ground trembles, and even the lord of the silent kingdom is afraid lest he be exposed, and the soil split open in wide fissures, and the light admitted to scare the anxious dead
1538	metamorphoses	Fearing this disaster, the king of the dark had left his shadowy realm, and, drawn in his chariot by black horses, carefully circled the foundations of the Sicilian land
1539	metamorphoses	 When he had checked and was satisfied that nothing was collapsing, he relinquished his fears
1540	metamorphoses	 Then Venus, at Eryx, saw him moving, as she sat on the hillside, and embraced her winged son, Cupid, and said ‘My child, my hands and weapons, my power, seize those arrows, that overcome all, and devise a path for your swift arrows, to the heart of that god to whom the final share of the triple kingdom fell
1541	metamorphoses	 You conquer the gods and Jupiter himself, the lords of the sea, and their very king, who controls the lords of the sea
1542	metamorphoses	 Why is Tartarus excepted? Why not extend your mother’s kingdom and your own? We are talking of a third part of the world
1543	metamorphoses	 And yet, as is evident to me, I am scorned in heaven, and Love’s power diminishes with mine
1544	metamorphoses	Don’t you see how Pallas, and the huntress Diana, forsake me? And Ceres’s daughter too, Proserpine, will be a virgin if we allow it, since she hopes to be like them
1545	metamorphoses	 But you, if you delight in our shared kingdom, can mate the goddess to her uncle
1546	metamorphoses	’ So Venus spoke: he undid his quiver, and at his mother’s bidding took an arrow, one from a thousand, and none was sharper, more certain, or better obeyed the bow
1547	metamorphoses	 Then he bent the pliant tips against his knee, and with his barbed arrow struck Dis in the heart
1548	metamorphoses	"”
"
1549	metamorphoses	“Not far from the walls of Enna, there is a deep pool
1550	metamorphoses	 Pergus is its name
1551	metamorphoses	 Caÿster does not hear more songs than rise from the swans on its gliding waves
1552	metamorphoses	 A wood encircles the waters, surrounds them on every side, and its leaves act as a veil, dispelling Phoebus’s shafts
1553	metamorphoses	 The branches give it coolness, and the moist soil, Tyrian purple flowers: there, it is everlasting Spring
1554	metamorphoses	 While Proserpine was playing in this glade, and gathering violets or radiant lilies, while with girlish fondness she filled the folds of her gown, and her basket, trying to outdo her companions in her picking, Dis, almost in a moment, saw her, prized her, took her: so swift as this, is love
1555	metamorphoses	 The frightened goddess cries out to her mother, to her friends, most of all to her mother, with piteous mouth
1556	metamorphoses	 Since she had torn her dress at the opening, the flowers she had collected fell from her loosened tunic, and even their scattering caused her virgin tears
1557	metamorphoses	 The ravisher whipped up his chariot, and urged on the horses, calling them by name, shaking out the shadowy, dark-dyed, reins, over their necks and manes, through deep pools, they say, and the sulphurous reeking swamps of the Palici, vented from a crevice of the earth, to Syracuse where the Bacchiadae, a people born of Corinth between two seas, laid out their city between unequal harbours
1558	metamorphoses	Between Cyane and Pisaean Arethusa, there is a bay enclosed by narrow arms
1559	metamorphoses	 Here lived Cyane, best known of the Sicilian nymphs, from whom the name of the spring was also taken
1560	metamorphoses	 She showed herself from the pool as far as her waist, and recognising the goddess, cried out to Dis, ‘No’, and ‘Go no further!’ ‘You cannot be Ceres’s son against her will: the girl should have been asked, and not abused
1561	metamorphoses	 If it is right for me to compare small things with great, Anapis prized me and I wedded him, but I was persuaded by talk and not by terror
1562	metamorphoses	’ Speaking, she stretched her arms out at her sides, obstructing him
1563	metamorphoses	 The son of Saturn could scarcely contain his wrath, and urging on the dread horses, he turned his royal sceptre with powerful arm, and plunged it through the bottom of the pool
1564	metamorphoses	 The earth, pierced, made a road to Tartarus, and swallowed the headlong chariot, into the midst of the abyss
1565	metamorphoses	"”
"
1566	metamorphoses	“Cyane, mourning the rape of the goddess, and the contempt for the sanctities of her fountain, nursed an inconsolable grief in her silent heart, and pined away wholly with sorrow
1567	metamorphoses	 She melted into those waters whose great goddess she had previously been
1568	metamorphoses	 You might see her limbs becoming softened, her bones seeming pliant, her nails losing their hardness
1569	metamorphoses	 First of all the slenderest parts dissolve: her dusky hair, her fingers and toes, her feet and ankles (since it is no great transformation from fragile limbs to cool waters)
1570	metamorphoses	 Next her breast and back, shoulders and flanks slip away, vanishing into tenuous streams
1571	metamorphoses	 At last the water runs in her ruined veins, and nothing remains that you could touch
1572	metamorphoses	Meanwhile the mother, fearing, searches in vain for the maid, through all the earth and sea
1573	metamorphoses	 Neither the coming of dewy-haired Aurora, nor Hesperus, finds her resting
1574	metamorphoses	 Lighting pine torches with both hands at Etna’s fires, she wanders, unquiet, through the bitter darkness, and when the kindly light has dimmed the stars, she still seeks her child, from the rising of the sun till the setting of the sun
1575	metamorphoses	She found herself thirsty and weary from her efforts, and had not moistened her lips at any of the springs, when by chance she saw a hut with a roof of straw, and she knocked on its humble door
1576	metamorphoses	 At that sound, an old woman emerged, and saw the goddess, and, when she asked for water, gave her something sweet made with malted barley
1577	metamorphoses	 While she drank what she had been given a rash, foul-mouthed boy stood watching, and taunted her, and called her greedy
1578	metamorphoses	 The goddess was offended, and threw the liquid she had not yet drunk, mixed with the grains of barley, in his face
1579	metamorphoses	 His skin, absorbing it, became spotted, and where he had once had arms, he now had legs
1580	metamorphoses	 A tail was added to his altered limbs, and he shrank to a little shape, so that he has no great power to harm
1581	metamorphoses	 He is like a lesser lizard, a newt, of tiny size
1582	metamorphoses	 The old woman wondered and wept, and, trying to touch the creature, it ran from her and searched out a place to hide
1583	metamorphoses	 It has a name fitting for its offence, stellio, its body starred with various spots
1584	metamorphoses	It would take too long to tell through what lands and seas the goddess wandered
1585	metamorphoses	 Searching the whole earth, she failed to find her daughter: she returned to Sicily, and while crossing it from end to end, she came to Cyane, who if she had not been changed would have told all
1586	metamorphoses	 But though she wished to, she had neither mouth nor tongue, nor anything with which to speak
1587	metamorphoses	 Still she revealed clear evidence, known to the mother, and showed Persephone’s ribbon, fallen, by chance, into the sacred pool
1588	metamorphoses	 As soon as she recognised it, the goddess tore her dishevelled hair, and beat her breast again and again with her hands, as if she at last comprehended the rape
1589	metamorphoses	 She did not know yet where Persephone was, but condemned all the lands, and called them thankless and unworthy of her gift of corn, Sicily, that Trinacria, above all, where she had discovered the traces of her loss
1590	metamorphoses	So, in that place, with cruel hands, she broke the ploughs that turned up the soil, and, in her anger, dealt destruction to farmers, and the cattle in their fields, alike, and ordered the ever-faithful land to fail, and spoiled the sowing
1591	metamorphoses	 The fertility of that country, acclaimed throughout the world, was spoken of as a fiction: the crops died as young shoots, destroyed by too much sun, and then by too much rain
1592	metamorphoses	 Wind and weather harmed them, and hungry birds gathered the scattered seed
1593	metamorphoses	 Thistles and darnel and stubborn grasses ruined the wheat harvest
1594	metamorphoses	"”
"
1595	metamorphoses	“Then Arethusa, once of Elis, whom Alpheus loved, lifted her head from her pool, and brushed the wet hair from her forehead, saying ‘O great goddess of the crops, mother of that virgin sought through all the earth, end your fruitless efforts, and do not anger yourself so deeply against the faithful land
1596	metamorphoses	 The land does not deserve it: it opened to the rape against its will
1597	metamorphoses	 It is not my country I pray for: I came here as a stranger
1598	metamorphoses	 Pisa is my country, and Elis is my source
1599	metamorphoses	 I am a foreigner in Sicily, but its soil is more to me than other lands
1600	metamorphoses	 Here is my home: here are my household gods
1601	metamorphoses	 Most gentle one, preserve it
1602	metamorphoses	 A fitting time will come for me to tell you, how I moved from my country, and came to Ortygia, over such a great expanse of sea, when you are free of care, and of happier countenance
1603	metamorphoses	 The fissured earth showed me a way, and slipping below the deepest caverns, here, I lifted up my head, and saw the unfamiliar stars
1604	metamorphoses	So, while I glided underground down there, among Stygian streams, with these very eyes, I saw your Proserpine
1605	metamorphoses	 She was sad indeed, but, though her face was fearful still, she was nevertheless a queen, the greatest one among the world of shadows, the powerful consort, nevertheless, of the king of hell!’ The mother was stunned to hear these words, as if petrified, and was, for a long time, like someone thunderstruck, until the blow of deep amazement became deep indignation
1606	metamorphoses	 She rose, in her chariot, to the realms of heaven
1607	metamorphoses	 There, her whole face clouded with hate, she appeared before Jove with dishevelled hair
1608	metamorphoses	‘Jupiter I have come to you in entreaty for my child and for your own’ she cried
1609	metamorphoses	 ‘If the mother finds no favour with you, let the daughter move you, and do not let your concern for her be less, I beg you, because I gave her birth
1610	metamorphoses	 See, the daughter I have searched for so long, has been found, if you call it finding to lose her more surely, if you call it finding merely to know where she is
1611	metamorphoses	 I can bear the fact that she has been raped, if he will only return her! A spoiler is not worthy to be the husband of your daughter, even if she is no longer my daughter
1612	metamorphoses	’ Jupiter replied ‘Our child is a pledge and a charge, between us, you and I
1613	metamorphoses	 But if only we are willing to give things their right names, the thing is not an insult in itself: the truth is it is love
1614	metamorphoses	 He would not be a shameful son-in-law for us, if only you would wish it, goddess
1615	metamorphoses	 How great a thing it is to be Jupiter’s brother, even if all the rest is lacking! Why, what if there is nothing lacking at all, except what he yielded to me by lot? But if you have such a great desire to separate them, Proserpine shall return to heaven, but on only one condition, that no food has touched her lips, since that is the law, decreed by the Fates
1616	metamorphoses	"’ ”
"
1617	metamorphoses	“He spoke, and Ceres felt sure of regaining her daughter
1618	metamorphoses	 But the Fates would not allow it, for the girl had broken her fast, and wandering, innocently, in a well-tended garden, she had pulled down a reddish-purple pomegranate fruit, hanging from a tree, and, taking seven seeds from its yellow rind, squeezed them in her mouth
1619	metamorphoses	 Ascalaphus was the only one to see it, whom, it is said, Orphne bore, to her Acheron, in the dark woods, she not the least known of the nymphs of Avernus
1620	metamorphoses	 He saw, and by his cruel disclosure, prevented Proserpine’s return
1621	metamorphoses	 Then the queen of Erebus grieved, and changed the informant into a bird of ill omen: she sprinkled his head with water from the Phlegethon, and changed him to a beak, plumage, and a pair of huge eyes
1622	metamorphoses	 Losing his own form he is covered by his tawny wings, and looks like a head, and long, curving claws
1623	metamorphoses	 He scarcely stirs the feathers growing on his idle wings
1624	metamorphoses	 He has become an odious bird, a messenger of future disaster, the screech owl, torpid by day, a fearful omen to mortal creatures
1625	metamorphoses	He indeed can be seen to have deserved his punishment, because of his disclosure and his words
1626	metamorphoses	 But why have you, Sirens, skilled in song, daughters of Acheloüs, the feathers and claws of birds, while still bearing human faces? Is it because you were numbered among the companions, when Proserpine gathered the flowers of Spring? When you had searched in vain for her on land, you wanted, then, to cross the waves on beating wings, so that the waters would also know of your trouble
1627	metamorphoses	 The gods were willing, and suddenly you saw your limbs covered with golden plumage
1628	metamorphoses	 But, so that your song, born, sweetly, in our ears, and your rich vocal gift, might not be lost with your tongues, each virgin face and human voice remained
1629	metamorphoses	Now Jupiter, intervening, between his brother and grieving sister, divides the turning year, equally
1630	metamorphoses	 And now the goddess, Persephone, shared divinity of the two kingdoms, spends so many months with her mother, so many months with her husband
1631	metamorphoses	 The aspect of her face and mind alters in a moment
1632	metamorphoses	 Now the goddess’s looks are glad that even Dis could see were sad, a moment ago
1633	metamorphoses	 Just as the sun, hidden, before, by clouds of rain, wins through and leaves the clouds
1634	metamorphoses	"”
"
1635	metamorphoses	“Ceres, kindly now, happy in the return of her daughter, asks what the cause of your flight was, Arethusa, and why you are now a sacred fountain
1636	metamorphoses	 The waters fall silent while their goddess lifts her head from the deep pool, and wringing the water from her sea-green tresses, she tells of the former love of that river of Elis
1637	metamorphoses	‘I was one of the nymphs, that lived in Achaia,’ she said ‘none of them keener to travel the woodland, none of them keener to set out the nets
1638	metamorphoses	 But, though I never sought fame for my beauty, though I was wiry, my name was, the beautiful
1639	metamorphoses	 Nor did my looks, praised too often, give me delight
1640	metamorphoses	 I blushed like a simpleton at the gifts of my body, those things that other girls used to rejoice in
1641	metamorphoses	 I thought it was sinful to please
1642	metamorphoses	Tired (I remember), I was returning, from the Stymphalian woods
1643	metamorphoses	 It was hot, and my efforts had doubled the heat
1644	metamorphoses	 I came to a river, without a ripple, hurrying on without a murmur, clear to its bed, in whose depths you could count every pebble: you would scarce think it moving
1645	metamorphoses	 Silvery willows and poplars, fed by the waters, gave a natural shade to the sloping banks
1646	metamorphoses	 Approaching I dipped my toes in, then as far as my knees, and not content with that I undressed, and draped my light clothes on a hanging willow, and plunged, naked, into the stream
1647	metamorphoses	 While I gathered the water to me and splashed, gliding around in a thousand ways, and stretching out my arms to shake the water from them, I thought I heard a murmur under the surface, and, in fear, I leapt for the nearest bank of the flood
1648	metamorphoses	‘What are you rushing for, Arethusa?’ Alpheus called from the waves
1649	metamorphoses	 ‘Why are you rushing?’ He called again to me, in a strident voice
1650	metamorphoses	 Just as I was, I fled, without my clothes (I had left my clothes on the other bank): so much the more fiercely he pursued and burned, and being naked, I seemed readier for him
1651	metamorphoses	 So I ran, and so he wildly followed, as doves fly from a hawk on flickering wings, as a hawk is used to chasing frightened doves
1652	metamorphoses	 Even beyond Orchemenus, I still ran, by Psophis, and Cyllene, and the ridges of Maenalus, by chill Erymanthus, Elis, he no quicker than I
1653	metamorphoses	 But I could not stay the course, being unequal in strength: he was fitted for unremitting effort
1654	metamorphoses	 Still, across the plains, over tree-covered mountains, through rocks and crags, and where there was no path, I ran
1655	metamorphoses	 The sun was at my back
1656	metamorphoses	 I saw a long shadow stretching before my feet, unless it was my fear that saw it, but certainly I feared the sound of feet, and the deep breaths from his mouth stirred the ribbons in my hair
1657	metamorphoses	 Weary with the effort to escape him, I cried out ‘Help me: I will be taken
1658	metamorphoses	 Diana, help the one who bore your weapons for you, whom you often gave your bow to carry, and your quiver with all its arrows!’ The goddess was moved, and raising an impenetrable cloud, threw it over me
1659	metamorphoses	The river-god circled the concealing fog, and in ignorance searched about the hollow mist
1660	metamorphoses	 Twice, without understanding, he rounded the place, where the goddess had concealed me, and twice called out ‘Arethusa, O Arethusa!’ What wretched feelings were mine, then? Perhaps those the lamb has when it hears the wolves, howling round the high fold, or the hare, that, hidden in the briars, sees the dogs hostile muzzles, and does not dare to make a movement of its body? He did not go far: he could see no signs of my tracks further on: he observed the cloud and the place
1661	metamorphoses	 Cold sweat poured down my imprisoned limbs, and dark drops trickled from my whole body
1662	metamorphoses	 Wherever I moved my foot, a pool gathered, and moisture dripped from my hair, and faster than I can now tell the tale I turned to liquid
1663	metamorphoses	 And indeed the river-god saw his love in the water, and putting off the shape of a man he had assumed, he changed back to his own watery form, and mingled with mine
1664	metamorphoses	 The Delian goddess split the earth, and plunging down into secret caverns, I was brought here to Ortygia, dear to me, because it has the same name as my goddess, the ancient name, for Delos, where she was born, and this was the first place to receive me, into the clear air
1665	metamorphoses	"’ ”
"
1666	metamorphoses	“That was as far as Arethusa went
1667	metamorphoses	 The goddess of all that is fertile, fastened twin dragons to her chariot, curbing them with the bit, between their teeth, and was carried through the air, between heaven and earth
1668	metamorphoses	 Reaching Eleusis, by Athens, city of Tritonian Minerva, she gave her swift chariot to Triptolemus, and ordered him to scatter the seeds she gave, partly in untilled soil, partly in fields reclaimed, after lying for a long time fallow
1669	metamorphoses	Now the youth was carried high over Europe and Asia
1670	metamorphoses	 He turned his face towards Scythia where, Lyncus was king
1671	metamorphoses	 He stood before the king’s household gods
1672	metamorphoses	 He was asked how he had come there, and the reason for his journey, his name and his country
1673	metamorphoses	 He said ‘Athens, the famous city, is my home, Triptolemus, my name
1674	metamorphoses	 I came not by ship, on the sea, or by foot, over land
1675	metamorphoses	 The clear air parted for me
1676	metamorphoses	 I bring you the gifts of Ceres
1677	metamorphoses	 If you scatter them through the wide fields, they will give you back fruitful harvests, and ripening crops
1678	metamorphoses	’ The barbarian was jealous
1679	metamorphoses	 So that he might be the author, of so great a gift, he received him like a guest, but attacked Triptolemus, with a sword, while he was in deep sleep
1680	metamorphoses	 As he attempted to pierce the youth’s breast, Ceres turned the king into a lynx, then ordered the youth, of Athens, the city of Mopsopus, to drive the sacred team back through the air
1681	metamorphoses	"”
"
1682	metamorphoses	‘So ended the singing, from the greatest of our singers, and the nymphs, with one harmonious voice, said that the goddesses of Helicon had taken the honours
1683	metamorphoses	 When the losers hurled abuse at us, I said “Seeing that you deserve punishment enough for your challenge, and now add profanities to your offence, and since our patience is not unlimited, we will move on to sentence you, and follow where anger prompts us
1684	metamorphoses	” The Emathides laughed and ridiculed these threatening words, but as they tried to speak, and, attack us with insolent hands, making a great clamour, they saw feathers spring from under their nails, and plumage cover their arms
1685	metamorphoses	 Each one saw the next one’s mouth harden to a solid beak, and a new bird enter the trees
1686	metamorphoses	 When they wanted to beat their breasts in sorrow, they hung in the air, lifted by the movement of their arms, magpies now, the slanderers of the woods
1687	metamorphoses	 Even now, as birds, their former eloquence remains, their raucous garrulity, and their monstrous capacity for chatter
1688	metamorphoses	"’
"
1689	metamorphoses	Tritonian Minerva had listened to every word, and approved of the Aonian Muses’s song, and their justified indignation
1690	metamorphoses	 Then she said, to herself, ‘To give praise is not enough, let me be praised as well, and not allow my divine powers to be scorned without inflicting punishment
1691	metamorphoses	’ Her thoughts turned to Arachne, of Maeonia, whom she had heard would not give her due credit, in the art of spinning
1692	metamorphoses	 The girl was not known for her place of birth, or family, but for her skill
1693	metamorphoses	 Her father, Idmon of Colophon, dyed the absorbent wool purple, with Phocaean murex
1694	metamorphoses	 Her mother was dead
1695	metamorphoses	 She too had been of humble birth, and the father the same
1696	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless, though she lived in a modest home, in little Hypaepa, Arachne had gained a name for artistry, throughout the cities of Lydia
1697	metamorphoses	Often the nymphs of Mount Tmolus deserted their vine-covered slopes, and the nymphs of the River Pactolus deserted their waves, to examine her wonderful workmanship
1698	metamorphoses	 It was not only a joy to see the finished cloths, but also to watch them made: so much beauty added to art
1699	metamorphoses	 Whether at first she was winding the rough yarn into a new ball, or working the stuff with her fingers, teasing out the clouds of wool, repeatedly, drawing them into long equal threads, twirling the slender spindle with practised thumb, or embroidering with her needle, you could see she was taught by Pallas
1700	metamorphoses	 Yet she denied it, and took offence at the idea of such a teacher
1701	metamorphoses	 ‘Contend with me’ she said ‘I will not disagree at all if I am beaten’
1702	metamorphoses	Pallas Minerva took the shape of an old woman: adding grey hair to her temples, and ageing her limbs, which she supported with a stick
1703	metamorphoses	 Then she spoke, to the girl, as follows
1704	metamorphoses	 ‘Not everything old age has is to be shunned: knowledge comes with advancing years
1705	metamorphoses	 Do not reject my advice: seek great fame amongst mortals for your skill in weaving, but give way to the goddess, and ask her forgiveness, rash girl, with a humble voice: she will forgive if you will ask
1706	metamorphoses	’ Arachne looked fiercely at her and left the work she was on: scarcely restraining her hands, and with dark anger in her face
1707	metamorphoses	 Pallas, disguised it is true, received this answer
1708	metamorphoses	 ‘Weak-minded and worn out by tedious old age, you come here, and having lived too long destroys you
1709	metamorphoses	 Let your daughter-in-law if you have one, let your daughter if you have one, listen to your voice
1710	metamorphoses	 I have wisdom enough of my own
1711	metamorphoses	 You think your advice is never heeded: that is my feeling too
1712	metamorphoses	" Why does she not come herself? Why does she shirk this contest?’
"
1713	metamorphoses	The goddess said ‘She is here!’ and, relinquishing the old woman’s form, revealed Pallas Minerva
1714	metamorphoses	 The nymphs and the Phrygian women worshipped her godhead: the girl alone remained unafraid, yet she did blush, as the sky is accustomed to redden when Aurora first stirs, and, after a while, to whiten at the sun from the east
1715	metamorphoses	 She is stubborn in her attempt, and rushes on to her fate, eager for a worthless prize
1716	metamorphoses	 Now, Jupiter’s daughter does not refuse, and does not give warning, or delay the contest a moment
1717	metamorphoses	 Immediately they both position themselves, in separate places, and stretch out the fine threads, for the warp, over twin frames
1718	metamorphoses	 The frame is fastened to the cross-beam; the threads of the warp separated with the reed; the thread of the weft is inserted between, in the pointed shuttles that their fingers have readied; and, drawn through the warp, the threads of the weft are beaten into place, struck by the comb’s notched teeth
1719	metamorphoses	 They each work quickly, and, with their clothes gathered in tight, under their breasts, apply skilful arms, their zeal not making it seem like work
1720	metamorphoses	 There, shades of purple, dyed in Tyrian bronze vessels, are woven into the cloth, and also lighter colours, shading off gradually
1721	metamorphoses	 The threads that touch seem the same, but the extremes are distant, as when, often, after a rainstorm, the expanse of the sky, struck by the sunlight, is stained by a rainbow in one vast arch, in which a thousand separate colours shine, but the eye itself still cannot see the transitions
1722	metamorphoses	 There, are inserted lasting threads of gold, and an ancient tale is spun in the web
1723	metamorphoses	Pallas Athene depicts the hill of Mars, and the court of the Aeropagus, in Cecrops’s Athens, and the old dispute between Neptune and herself, as to who had the right to the city and its name
1724	metamorphoses	 There the twelve gods sit in great majesty, on their high thrones, with Jupiter in the middle
1725	metamorphoses	 She weaves the gods with their familiar attributes
1726	metamorphoses	 The image of Jupiter is a royal one
1727	metamorphoses	 There she portrays the Ocean god, standing and striking the rough stone, with his long trident, and seawater flowing from the centre of the shattered rock, a token of his claim to the city
1728	metamorphoses	 She gives herself a shield, a sharp pointed spear, and a helmet for her head, while the aegis protects her breast
1729	metamorphoses	 She shows an olive-tree with pale trunk, thick with fruit, born from the earth at a blow from her spear, the gods marvelling: and Victory crowns the work
1730	metamorphoses	Then she adds four scenes of contest in the four corners, each with miniature figures, in their own clear colours, so that her rival might learn, from the examples quoted, what prize she might expect, for her outrageous daring
1731	metamorphoses	 One corner shows Thracian Mount Rhodope and Mount Haemus, now icy peaks, once mortal beings who ascribed the names of the highest gods to themselves
1732	metamorphoses	 A second corner shows the miserable fate of the queen of the Pygmies: how Juno, having overcome her in a contest, ordered her to become a crane and make war on her own people
1733	metamorphoses	 Also she pictures Antigone, whom Queen Juno turned into a bird for having dared to compete with Jupiter’s great consort: neither her father Laomedon, nor her city Ilium were of any use to her, but taking wing as a white stork she applauds herself with clattering beak
1734	metamorphoses	 The only corner left shows Cinyras, bereaved: and he is seen weeping as he clasps the stone steps of the temple that were once his daughters’ limbs
1735	metamorphoses	 Minerva surrounded the outer edges with the olive wreaths of peace (this was the last part) and so ended her work with emblems of her own tree
1736	metamorphoses	The Maeonian girl depicts Europa deceived by the form of the bull: you would have thought it a real bull and real waves
1737	metamorphoses	 She is seen looking back to the shore she has left, and calling to her companions, displaying fear at the touch of the surging water, and drawing up her shrinking feet
1738	metamorphoses	 Also Arachne showed Asterie, held by the eagle, struggling, and Leda lying beneath the swan’s wings
1739	metamorphoses	 She added Jupiter who, hidden in the form of a satyr, filled Antiope, daughter of Nycteus with twin offspring; who, as Amphitryon, was charmed by you, Alcmena, of Tiryns; by Danaë, as a golden shower; by Aegina, daughter of Asopus, as a flame; by Mnemosyne, as a shepherd; by Proserpine, Ceres’s daughter, as a spotted snake
1740	metamorphoses	" 
"
1741	metamorphoses	She wove you, Neptune, also, changed to a fierce bull for Canace, Aeolus’s daughter
1742	metamorphoses	 In Enipeus’s form you begot the Aloidae, and deceived Theophane as a ram
1743	metamorphoses	 The golden-haired, gentlest, mother of the cornfields, knew you as a horse
1744	metamorphoses	 The snake-haired mother of the winged horse, knew you as a winged bird
1745	metamorphoses	 Melantho knew you as a dolphin
1746	metamorphoses	 She gave all these their own aspects, and the aspects of the place
1747	metamorphoses	 Here is Phoebus like a countryman, and she shows him now with the wings of a hawk, and now in a lion’s skin, and how as a shepherd he tricked Isse, Macareus’s daughter
1748	metamorphoses	 She showed how Bacchus ensnared Erigone with delusive grapes, and how Saturn as the double of a horse begot Chiron
1749	metamorphoses	 The outer edge of the web, surrounded by a narrow border, had flowers interwoven with entangled ivy
1750	metamorphoses	Neither Pallas nor Envy itself could fault that work
1751	metamorphoses	 The golden-haired warrior goddess was grieved by its success, and tore the tapestry, embroidered with the gods’ crimes, and as she held her shuttle made of boxwood from Mount Cytorus, she struck Idmonian Arachne, three or four times, on the forehead
1752	metamorphoses	 The unfortunate girl could not bear it, and courageously slipped a noose around her neck: Pallas, in pity, lifted her, as she hung there, and said these words, ‘Live on then, and yet hang, condemned one, but, lest you are careless in future, this same condition is declared, in punishment, against your descendants, to the last generation!’ Departing after saying this, she sprinkled her with the juice of Hecate’s herb, and immediately at the touch of this dark poison, Arachne’s hair fell out
1753	metamorphoses	 With it went her nose and ears, her head shrank to the smallest size, and her whole body became tiny
1754	metamorphoses	 Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs, the rest is belly, from which she still spins a thread, and, as a spider, weaves her ancient web
1755	metamorphoses	All of Lydia murmurs: the tale goes through the towns of Phrygia, and fills the whole world with talk
1756	metamorphoses	 Niobe had known Arachne
1757	metamorphoses	 As a girl, before her marriage, she had lived in Maeonia, near Mount Sipylus
1758	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless she was not warned by her countrywoman’s fate, to give the gods precedence, and use more modest words
1759	metamorphoses	 Many things swelled her pride, but neither her husband Amphion’s marvellous art in music, nor both of their high lineages, nor the might of their great kingdom of Thebes, pleased her, though they did please her, as much as her children did
1760	metamorphoses	 And Niobe would have been spoken of as the most fortunate of mothers, if she had not seemed so to herself
1761	metamorphoses	Now Manto, the daughter of Tiresias, prescient of the future, stirred by divine impulse, went through the middle of the streets, declaiming
1762	metamorphoses	 ‘Women of Thebes, Ismenides, go, as a crowd, and wreathe your hair with laurel, and bring incense with holy prayer to Latona, and Latona’s children, Diana and Apollo
1763	metamorphoses	 Latona commands it through my mouth
1764	metamorphoses	’ They obey: all the Theban women, as commanded, dress their temples with sweet-bay, and bring incense and words of prayer to the sacred flames
1765	metamorphoses	Look, Niobe comes, followed by a crowded thong, visible, in her Phrygian robes woven with gold, and as beautiful as anger will let her be
1766	metamorphoses	 Turning her lovely head with the hair falling loose over both her shoulders, she pauses, and looks around with pride in her eyes, from her full height, saying ‘What madness, to prefer the gods you are told about to the ones you see? Why is Latona worshipped at the altars, while as yet my godhead is without its incense? Tantalus is my father, who is the only man to eat the food of the gods
1767	metamorphoses	 My mother is one of the seven sisters, the Pleiades
1768	metamorphoses	 Great Atlas, who carries the axis of the heavens on his shoulders, is one of my grandfathers
1769	metamorphoses	 Jupiter is the other, and I glory in having him as my father-in-law as well
1770	metamorphoses	 The peoples of Phrygia fear me
1771	metamorphoses	 Cadmus’s royal house is under my rule: and the walls, built to my husband’s lyre, and Thebes’s people, will be ruled by his power and mine
1772	metamorphoses	 Whichever part of the palace I turn my eyes on, I look at immense wealth
1773	metamorphoses	 Augment it with my beauty, worthy of a goddess, and add to this my seven daughters, as many sons, and soon my sons- and my daughters-in-law! Now, ask what the reason is for my pride, and then dare to prefer Latona to me, that Titaness, daughter of Coeus, whoever he is
1774	metamorphoses	 Latona, whom the wide earth once refused even a little piece of ground to give birth on
1775	metamorphoses	Land, sea, and sky were no refuge for your goddess
1776	metamorphoses	 She was exiled from the world, until Delos, pitying the wanderer, gave her a precarious place, saying “Friend, you wander the earth, I the sea
1777	metamorphoses	” There she gave birth to twins, only a seventh of my offspring
1778	metamorphoses	 I am fortunate (indeed, who can deny it?) and I will stay fortunate (and who can doubt that too?)
1779	metamorphoses	 My riches make me safe
1780	metamorphoses	 I am greater than any whom Fortune can harm, and though she could take much away, she would leave me much more
1781	metamorphoses	 Surely my comforts banish fear
1782	metamorphoses	 Imagine that some of this host of children could be taken from me, I would still not, bereaved, be reduced to the two of Latona’s family
1783	metamorphoses	 In that state, how far is she from childlessness? Go home – enough of holy things – and take those laurel wreaths from your hair!’ They relinquish them, and leave the rite unfinished, except what is their right, reverencing the goddess in a secret murmur
1784	metamorphoses	The goddess was deeply angered, and on the summit of Mount Cynthus she spoke to her twin children
1785	metamorphoses	 ‘See, it will be doubted whether I, your mother, proud to have borne you, and giving way to no goddess, except Juno, am a goddess, and worship will be prevented at my altars through all the ages, unless you help me, my children
1786	metamorphoses	 Nor is this my only grief
1787	metamorphoses	 This daughter of Tantalus has added insult to injury, and has dared to put her children above you, and has called me childless, may that recoil on her own head, and has shown she has her father’s tongue for wickedness
1788	metamorphoses	’ Latona would have added her entreaties to what she had related, but Phoebus cried ‘Enough! Long complaint delays her punishment!’ Phoebe said the same, and falling swiftly through the air, concealed by clouds, they reached the house of Cadmus
1789	metamorphoses	There was a broad, open plain near the walls, flattened by the constant passage of horses, where many wheels and hard hooves had levelled the turf beneath them
1790	metamorphoses	 There, a number of Amphion’s seven sons mounted on their strong horses, and sitting firmly on their backs, bright with Tyrian purple, guided them using reins heavy with gold
1791	metamorphoses	 While Ismenus, one of these, who had been the first of his mother’s burdens, was wheeling his horse’s path around in an unerring circle, and hauling at the foaming bit, he cried out ‘Oh, I am wounded!’ and revealed an arrow fixed in his chest, and loosing the reins from his dying hands, slipped gradually, sideways, over his mount’s right shoulder
1792	metamorphoses	Next Sipylus, hearing the sound of a quiver in the empty air, let out the reins, just as a shipmaster sensing a storm runs for it when he sees the cloud, and claps on all sail, so that not even the slightest breeze is lost
1793	metamorphoses	 Still giving full rein, he was overtaken, by the arrow none can avoid, and the shaft stuck quivering in his neck, and the naked tip protruded from his throat
1794	metamorphoses	 Leaning forward, as he was, he rolled down over the mane and the galloping hooves, and stained the ground with warm blood
1795	metamorphoses	Unlucky Phaedimus, and Tantalus, who carried his grandfather’s name, at the end of the usual task imposed on them, had joined the exercise of the young men, and were gleaming with oil in the wrestling match
1796	metamorphoses	 And now they were fully engaged, in a tight hold, chest to chest, when an arrow, loosed from the taut bow, pierced them both, as they were
1797	metamorphoses	 They groaned as one, and fell as one, their limbs contorted with pain
1798	metamorphoses	 As they lay there, they cast a last dying look, as one, and, as one, gave up the ghost
1799	metamorphoses	 Alphenor saw them die, and striking at his breast in anguish, he ran to them to lift their cold bodies in his embrace
1800	metamorphoses	 In this filial service he also fell, for Delian Apollo tore at his innermost parts with deadly steel
1801	metamorphoses	 As the shaft was removed, a section of his lung was drawn with it, caught on the barbs, and with his life’s blood his spirit rushed out into the air
1802	metamorphoses	But it was not a simple wound that longhaired Damasicthon suffered
1803	metamorphoses	 He was hit where the shin begins, and where the sinews of the knee leave a soft place between
1804	metamorphoses	 While he was trying to pull out the fatal shaft with his hand, another arrow was driven into his throat as far as the feathers
1805	metamorphoses	 The rush of blood expelled it, and gushing out, spurted high in the air, in a long jet
1806	metamorphoses	 The last son, Ilioneus, stretched out his arms in vain entreaty
1807	metamorphoses	 ‘O you company of all the gods, spare me!’ he cried, unaware that he need not ask them all
1808	metamorphoses	 The archer god Apollo was moved, though already the dart could not be recalled: yet only a slight wound killed the boy, the arrow not striking deeply in his heart
1809	metamorphoses	The rumour of trouble, the people’s sorrow, and the tears of her own family, confirming sudden disaster to the mother, left her astounded that the gods could have done it, and angered that they had such power, and dared to use it
1810	metamorphoses	 Now, she learned that the father, Amphion, driving the iron blade through his heart, had, in dying, ended pain and life together
1811	metamorphoses	 Alas, how different this Niobe from that Niobe, the one, who a moment ago chased the people from Latona’s altar, and made her way through the city with head held high, enviable to her friends, and now more to be pitied by her enemies
1812	metamorphoses	 She threw herself on the cold bodies, and without regard for due ceremony, gave all her sons a last kiss
1813	metamorphoses	 Turning from them she lifted her bruised arms to the sky, and cried out ‘Feed your heart, cruel one, Latona, on my pain, feed your heart, and be done! Be done, savage spirit! I am buried seven times
1814	metamorphoses	 Exult and triumph over your enemy! But where is the victory? Even in my misery I have more than you in your happiness
1815	metamorphoses	" After so many deaths, I still outdo you!’
"
1816	metamorphoses	She spoke, and the twang of a taut bowstring sounded, terrifying all of them, except Niobe
1817	metamorphoses	 Pain gave her courage
1818	metamorphoses	 The sisters, with black garments, and loosened hair, were standing by their brothers’ bodies
1819	metamorphoses	 One, grasping at an arrow piercing her side, falling, fainted in death beside her brother’s face
1820	metamorphoses	 A second, attempting to comfort her grieving mother, fell silent, and was bent in agony with a hidden wound
1821	metamorphoses	 She pressed her lips together, but life had already fled
1822	metamorphoses	 One fell trying in vain to run, and her sister fell across her
1823	metamorphoses	 One tried to hide, while another trembled in full view
1824	metamorphoses	 Now six had been dealt death, suffering their various wounds: the last remained
1825	metamorphoses	 The mother, with all her robes and with her body, protected her, and cried out ‘Leave me just one, the youngest! I only ask for one, the youngest of all!’ While she prayed, she, for whom she prayed, was dead
1826	metamorphoses	 Childless, she sat among the bodies of her sons, her daughters, and her husband, frozen in grief
1827	metamorphoses	The breeze stirs not a hair, the colour of her cheeks is bloodless, and her eyes are fixed motionless in her sad face: nothing in that likeness is alive
1828	metamorphoses	 Inwardly her tongue is frozen to the solid roof of her mouth, and her veins cease their power to throb
1829	metamorphoses	 Her neck cannot bend, nor her arms recall their movement, nor her feet lead her anywhere
1830	metamorphoses	 Inside, her body is stone
1831	metamorphoses	 Yet she weeps, and, enclosed in a powerful whirlwind, she is snatched away to her own country: there, set on a mountain top, she wears away, and even now tears flow from the marble
1832	metamorphoses	Now all men and women are indeed afraid of the anger manifested by divine being, and all pay more respect to the great power of the goddess, the mother of the twins
1833	metamorphoses	 As often happens, because of recent events they tell old stories, and one says ‘In Lycia’s fertile fields, in ancient times, also, the farmers spurned the goddess, and not without suffering for it
1834	metamorphoses	 The thing is not well known, it is true, because the men were unknown, nevertheless, it was wonderful
1835	metamorphoses	 I myself saw the place, and the lake made notable by the strangeness of it, since my father, getting old, and unable to endure the journey, had ordered me to collect some choice cattle from there, and one of the men of that country had offered himself as a guide
1836	metamorphoses	 While I crossed the pastureland with him, there was an old altar, black with ashes, standing in the middle of a lake, surrounded by trembling reeds
1837	metamorphoses	" My guide stopped and, shivering with fear, said in a murmur ‘Have mercy on me!’ and I, similarly, said in a murmur ‘Have mercy!’
"
1838	metamorphoses	Then I asked him whether it was an altar to the Naiads, Faunus, or a local god, and my friend replied ‘Young man, it is no mountain spirit in this altar
1839	metamorphoses	 She calls it hers, whom the queen of heaven once banned from the world, and whom vagrant Delos, a lightly floating island, would barely accept, at her prayer
1840	metamorphoses	 There, between Pallas’s olive tree and a date-palm, Latona bore her twins, against their step-mother Juno’s will
1841	metamorphoses	 Having endured her labour, even then she fled Juno, carrying the divine twins clasped to her breast
1842	metamorphoses	Then, inside the borders of Lycia, home of the Chimaera, as the fierce sun scorched the fields, the goddess, weary from her long struggle, and parched by the radiant heat, felt her thirst: also her hungry children had drunk all her rich milk
1843	metamorphoses	 By chance she saw a smallish lake in a deep valley
1844	metamorphoses	 Countrymen were there, gathering bushy osiers, rushes, and the fine marsh sedges
1845	metamorphoses	 The Titan’s daughter approached, and putting her knee to the ground, rested, to enjoy a drink of the cool water
1846	metamorphoses	 The group of rustics denied it to her
1847	metamorphoses	 The goddess, denied, spoke
1848	metamorphoses	 ‘Why do you forbid me your waters? The use of water is everyone’s right
1849	metamorphoses	 Nature has not made the sun, or the air, or the clear waves, private things
1850	metamorphoses	 I come for a public gift, and yet I beg you to grant it to me as a suppliant
1851	metamorphoses	 I was not preparing to bathe my limbs and my weary body here, only to quench my thirst
1852	metamorphoses	 My mouth lacks moisture from speaking, my throat is dry, and there’s scarcely a path here for speech
1853	metamorphoses	 A drink of water would be nectar to me, and I would bear witness to accepting life from it, as well: you will be giving life from your waves
1854	metamorphoses	 Let these children move you, also, who stretch their little arms out from my breast
1855	metamorphoses	"’
"
1856	metamorphoses	And it chanced that they did stretch out their arms
1857	metamorphoses	 Who would not have been moved by the goddess’s winning words? Yet, despite her prayers they persisted in denying her, with threats, if she did not take herself off, and added insults besides
1858	metamorphoses	 Not content with that, they also stirred the pool with their hands and feet, and churned up the soft mud from the depths, by leaping about, maliciously
1859	metamorphoses	 Anger forgot thirst, for now the daughter of Coeus could not bear to beg from the unworthy, nor speak in words inferior to those of a goddess, and stretching her palms to the heavens, she said ‘Live in that swamp for ever!’ It happened as the goddess wished: It is their delight to be under the water, now to submerge their bodies completely in the deep pool, now to show their heads, now to swim on the surface
1860	metamorphoses	 Often they squat on the edges of the marsh, often retreat to the cool lake, but now as before they employ their ugly voices in quarrelling, and shamefully, even though they are under the water, from under the water they try out their abuse
1861	metamorphoses	 Now their voices are also hoarse, their inflated throats are swollen, and their croaking distends their wide mouths
1862	metamorphoses	 Their shoulders and heads meet, and their necks appear to have vanished
1863	metamorphoses	 Their backs are green; their bellies, the largest part of their body, are white, and, as newly made frogs, they leap in their muddy pool
1864	metamorphoses	When whoever it was had finished relating the ruin of the men of Lycia, another storyteller remembered the satyr, Marsyas, whom Apollo, Latona’s son, had defeated, playing on the flute, that Tritonian Minerva invented
1865	metamorphoses	 He had exacted punishment
1866	metamorphoses	 Marsyas cried ‘Why do you peel me out of myself? Aah! I repent’, he screamed in agony
1867	metamorphoses	 ‘Aah! Music is not worth this pain!’ As he screams, the skin is flayed from the surface of his body, no part is untouched
1868	metamorphoses	 Blood flows everywhere, the exposed sinews are visible, and the trembling veins quiver, without skin to hide them: you can number the internal organs, and the fibres of the lungs, clearly visible in his chest
1869	metamorphoses	 The woodland gods, and the fauns of the countryside, wept, and his brother satyrs, Olympus his friend and pupil, still dear to him then, and the nymphs, and all who pastured their fleecy sheep and horned cattle on those mountains
1870	metamorphoses	 The fertile soil was drenched, and the drenched earth caught the falling tears, and absorbed them into its deep veins
1871	metamorphoses	 It formed a stream then, and sent it into the clear air
1872	metamorphoses	 From there it ran within sloping banks, quickly, to the sea, the clearest river of Phrygia, taking Marsyas’s name
1873	metamorphoses	From such tales as these the company turns immediately to the present, and mourns the loss of Amphion and his children
1874	metamorphoses	 The mother was blamed, though even then one man, her brother Pelops, is said to have wept for her and, after taking off his tunic, to have shown the ivory, of his left shoulder
1875	metamorphoses	 This was of flesh, and the same colour as his right shoulder, at the time of his birth
1876	metamorphoses	 Later, when he had been cut in pieces, by his father, it is said that the gods fitted his limbs together again
1877	metamorphoses	 They found the pieces, but one was lost, between the upper arm and the neck
1878	metamorphoses	 Ivory was used in place of the missing part, and by means of that Pelops was made whole
1879	metamorphoses	The princes, of countries to the southwest, near neighbours of Thebes, gathered, and the cities related to Thebes urged their kings to go and offer sympathy
1880	metamorphoses	 Argos and Sparta, and Peloponnesian Mycenae, Calydon not yet cursed for rejecting Diana, fertile Orchomenos, and Corinth famous for bronze; warlike Messene, Patrae, and low-lying Cleonae, Nelean Pylos, and Troezen not yet ruled by Pittheus; and whichever of the other cities were southwest of the Isthmus, lying between its two seas, or seen to the northeast of the Isthmus, lying between its two seas
1881	metamorphoses	 But who can believe this? Athens, alone, did nothing
1882	metamorphoses	 War prevented them doing so
1883	metamorphoses	 A Barbarian army had crossed the sea and brought terror to the walls of the city of Mopsopius
1884	metamorphoses	Tereus of Thrace routed these Barbarians, with his army of auxiliaries, and won a great name by his victory
1885	metamorphoses	 Since Tereus was a master of men and riches, and happened to trace his descent from mighty Mars himself, Pandion, king of Athens, made them allies, by giving him his daughter Procne in marriage
1886	metamorphoses	 Neither Juno, who attends on brides, nor Hymen, nor the three Graces, was there
1887	metamorphoses	 The Eumenides, the Furies, held torches snatched from a funeral
1888	metamorphoses	 The Eumenides, the Furies, prepared their marriage bed, and the unholy screech owl brooded over their house, and sat on the roof of their chamber
1889	metamorphoses	 By this bird-omen, Procne and Tereus were joined
1890	metamorphoses	 By this bird-omen, they were made parents
1891	metamorphoses	 Thrace of course rejoiced with them, and they themselves gave thanks to the gods, and the day when Pandion’s daughter married her illustrious king, and the day on which Itys their son was born, they commanded to be celebrated as festivals: so, always, our real advantages escape us
1892	metamorphoses	Now, Titan, the sun, had guided the turning year through five autumns when Procne said, coaxingly to her husband, ‘If any thanks are due me, either send me to see my sister, or let my sister come here
1893	metamorphoses	 You can promise my father she will return after a brief stay
1894	metamorphoses	 It would be worth a great deal to me, if you allowed me to see Philomela
1895	metamorphoses	’ Tereus ordered his ship to sea, and with sail and oar reached the harbour of Cecrops, and landed on the shore of Piraeus
1896	metamorphoses	As soon as he gained access to his father-in-law, right hand was joined to right hand, and they began by wishing each other favourable omens
1897	metamorphoses	 Tereus had started to tell of the reason for his visit, his wife’s request, and promise a speedy return if she were sent back with him, when, see, Philomela entered, dressed in rich robes, and richer beauty, walking as we are used to being told the naiads and dryads of the deep woods do, if only one were to give them, like her, culture and dress
1898	metamorphoses	 Seeing the girl, Tereus took fire, just as if someone touched a flame to corn stubble, or burned the leaves, or hay stored in a loft
1899	metamorphoses	 Her beauty was worthy of it, but he was driven by his natural passion, and the inclination of the people of his region is towards lust: he burnt with his own vice and his nation’s
1900	metamorphoses	 His impulse was to erode her attendants care, and her nurse’s loyalty, even seduce the girl herself with rich gifts, to the extent of his kingdom, or rape her and defend the rape in savage war
1901	metamorphoses	 There was nothing he would not dare, possessed by unbridled desire, nor could he contain the flame in his heart
1902	metamorphoses	Now he suffered from impatience, and eagerly returned to Procne’s request, pursuing his own wishes as hers
1903	metamorphoses	 Desire made him eloquent, and whenever he petitioned more strongly than was seemly, he would make out that Procne wished it so
1904	metamorphoses	 He even embellished his speeches with tears, as though she had commissioned him to do that too
1905	metamorphoses	 You gods, what secret darknesses human hearts hide! Due to his efforts, Tereus is viewed as faithful, in his deceit, and is praised for his crime
1906	metamorphoses	 Moreover Philomela wishes his request granted, and resting her forearms on her father’s shoulders, coaxing him to let her go to visit her sister, she urges it, in her own interest, and against it
1907	metamorphoses	 Tereus gazes at her, and imagining her as already his, watching her kisses, and her arms encircling her father’s neck, it all spurs him on, food and fuel to his frenzy
1908	metamorphoses	 Whenever she embraces her father, he wishes he were that father: though of course his intentions would be no less wicked
1909	metamorphoses	 The father is won over by the twin entreaties
1910	metamorphoses	 The girl is overjoyed, and thanks her father, and thinks, poor wretch, that what will bring sorrow to both sisters is actually a success for both
1911	metamorphoses	Now little was left of Phoebus’s daily labour, and his horses were treading the spaces of the western sky
1912	metamorphoses	 A royal feast was served at Pandion’s table, with wine in golden goblets
1913	metamorphoses	 Then their bodies sated, they gave themselves to quiet sleep
1914	metamorphoses	 But though the Thracian king retired to bed, he was disturbed by thoughts of her, and remembering her features, her gestures, her hands, he imagined the rest that he had not yet seen, as he would wish, and fuelled his own fires, in sleepless restlessness
1915	metamorphoses	 Day broke, and Pandion, clasping his son-in-law’s right hand, in parting, with tears welling in his eyes, entrusted his daughter to him
1916	metamorphoses	 ‘Dear son, since affectionate reasons compel it, and both of them desire it (you too have desired it, Tereus), I give her over to you, and by your honour, by the entreaty of a heart joined to yours, and by the gods above, I beg you, protect her with a father’s love, and send back to me, as soon as is possible (it will be all too long a wait for me), this sweet comfort of my old age
1917	metamorphoses	" You too, as soon as is possible (it is enough that your sister is so far away), if you are at all dutiful, Philomela, return to me!’
"
1918	metamorphoses	So he commanded his daughter and kissed her, and soft tears mingled with his commands
1919	metamorphoses	 As a token of their promise he took their two right hands and linked them together, and asked them, with a prayer, to remember to greet his absent daughter, and grandson, for him
1920	metamorphoses	 His mouth sobbing, he could barely say a last farewell, and he feared the forebodings in his mind
1921	metamorphoses	As soon as Philomela was on board the brightly painted ship, and the sea was churned by the oars, and the land left behind them, the barbarian king cried ‘I have won! I carry with me what I wished for!’ He exults, and his passion can scarcely wait for its satisfaction
1922	metamorphoses	 He never turns his eyes away from her, no differently than when Jupiter’s eagle deposits a hare, caught by the curved talons, in its high eyrie: there is no escape for the captive, and the raptor gazes at its prize
1923	metamorphoses	Now they had completed their journey, and disembarked from the wave-worn ship, on the shores of his country
1924	metamorphoses	 The king took her to a high-walled building, hidden in an ancient forest, and there he locked her away, she, pale and trembling, fearing everything, in tears now, begging to know where her sister was
1925	metamorphoses	 Then, confessing his evil intent, he overcame her by force, she a virgin and alone, as she called out, again and again, in vain, to her father, her sister, and most of all to the great gods
1926	metamorphoses	 She quivered like a frightened lamb, that fails to realise it is free, wounded and discarded by a grey wolf, or like a dove trembling, its feathers stained with its blood, still fearing the rapacious claws that gripped it
1927	metamorphoses	 After a brief while, when she had come to her senses, she dragged at her dishevelled hair, and like a mourner, clawed at her arms, beating them against her breasts
1928	metamorphoses	 Hands outstretched, she shouted ‘Oh, you savage
1929	metamorphoses	 Oh, what an evil, cruel, thing you have done
1930	metamorphoses	 Did you care nothing for my father’s trust, sealed with holy tears, my sister’s affection, my own virginity, your marriage vows? You have confounded everything
1931	metamorphoses	 I have been forced to become my sister’s rival
1932	metamorphoses	 You are joined to both
1933	metamorphoses	 Now Procne will be my enemy! Why not rob me of life as well, you traitor, so that no crime escapes you? If only you had done it before that impious act
1934	metamorphoses	 Then my shade would have been free of guilt
1935	metamorphoses	 Yet, if the gods above witness such things, if the powers of heaven mean anything, if all is not lost, as I am, then one day you will pay me for this! I, without shame, will tell what you have done
1936	metamorphoses	 If I get the chance it will be in front of everyone
1937	metamorphoses	 If I am kept imprisoned in these woods, I will fill the woods with it, and move the stones, that know of my guilt, to pity
1938	metamorphoses	" The skies will hear of it, and any god that may be there!’
"
1939	metamorphoses	The king’s anger was stirred by these words, and his fear also
1940	metamorphoses	 Goaded by both, he freed the sword from its sheath by his side, and seizing her hair gathered it together, to use as a tie, to tether her arms behind her back
1941	metamorphoses	 Philomela, seeing the sword, and hoping only for death, offered up her throat
1942	metamorphoses	 But he severed her tongue with his savage blade, holding it with pincers, as she struggled to speak in her indignation, calling out her father’s name repeatedly
1943	metamorphoses	 Her tongue’s root was left quivering, while the rest of it lay on the dark soil, vibrating and trembling, and, as though it were the tail of a mutilated snake moving, it writhed, as if, in dying, it was searching for some sign of her
1944	metamorphoses	 They say (though I scarcely dare credit it) that even after this crime, he still assailed her wounded body, repeatedly, in his lust
1945	metamorphoses	" 
"
1946	metamorphoses	He controlled himself sufficiently to return to Procne, who, seeing him returned, asked where her sister was
1947	metamorphoses	 He, with false mourning, told of a fictitious funeral, and tears gave it credence
1948	metamorphoses	 Procne tore her glistening clothes, with their gold hems, from her shoulders, and put on black robes, and built an empty tomb, and mistakenly brought offerings, and lamented the fate of a sister, not yet due to be lamented in that way
1949	metamorphoses	The sun-god has circled the twelve signs, and a year is past
1950	metamorphoses	 What can Philomela do? A guard prevents her escape; the thick walls of the building are made of solid stone; her mute mouth can yield no token of the facts
1951	metamorphoses	 Great trouble is inventive, and ingenuity arises in difficult times
1952	metamorphoses	 Cleverly, she fastens her thread to a barbarian’s loom, and weaves purple designs on a white background, revealing the crime
1953	metamorphoses	 She entrusts it, when complete, to a servant, and asks her, by means of gestures, to take it to her mistress
1954	metamorphoses	 She, as she is asked, takes it to Procne, not knowing what it carries inside
1955	metamorphoses	 The wife of the savage king unrolls the cloth, and reads her sister’s terrible fate, and by a miracle keeps silent
1956	metamorphoses	 Grief restrains her lips, her tongue seeking to form words adequate to her indignation, fails
1957	metamorphoses	 She has no time for tears, but rushes off, in a confusion of right and wrong, her mind filled with thoughts of vengeance
1958	metamorphoses	It was the time when the young Thracian women used to celebrate the triennial festival of Bacchus
1959	metamorphoses	 (Night knew their holy rites: by night, Mount Rhodope rang with the high-pitched clashing of bronze)
1960	metamorphoses	 By night the queen left her palace, prepared herself for the rites of the god, and took up the weapons of that frenzied religion
1961	metamorphoses	 Tendrils of vine wreathed her head; a deerskin was draped over her left side; a light javelin rested on her shoulder
1962	metamorphoses	 Hurtling through the woods with a crowd of her companions, terrifying, driven by maddening grief, Procne embodies you, Bacchus
1963	metamorphoses	 She comes at last to the building in the wilderness, and howls out loud, giving the ecstatic cry of Euhoe, breaks the door down, seizes her sister, disguises her with the tokens of a wild Bacchante, hides her face with ivy leaves, and dragging her along with her, frightened out of her wits, leads her inside the palace walls
1964	metamorphoses	When Philomela realised that she had reached that accursed house, the wretched girl shuddered in horror, and her whole face grew deathly pale
1965	metamorphoses	 Procne, once there, took off the religious trappings; uncovered the downcast face of her unhappy sister, and clutched her in her arms
1966	metamorphoses	 But Philomela could not bear to lift her eyes, seeing herself as her sister’s betrayer
1967	metamorphoses	 With her face turned towards the ground, wanting to swear by the gods, and call them to witness, that her shame had been visited on her by force, she made signs with her hands in place of speech
1968	metamorphoses	 Procne burned, and could not control her anger, reproaching her sister for weeping, saying ‘Now is not the time for tears, but for the sword, or for what overcomes the sword, if you know of such a thing
1969	metamorphoses	 I am prepared for any wickedness, sister; to set the palace alight with a torch, and throw Tereus, the author of this, into the midst of the flames; or to cut out his eyes and tongue, and the parts which brought shame to you; or to force out his guilty spirit through a thousand wounds! I am ready for any enormity: but what it should be, I still do not know yet
1970	metamorphoses	"’
"
1971	metamorphoses	While Procne was going over these things, Itys came to his mother
1972	metamorphoses	 His arrival suggested what she might do, and regarding him with a cold gaze, she said ‘Ah! How like your father you are!’ Without speaking further, seething in silent indignation, she began to conceive her tragic plan
1973	metamorphoses	 Yet, when the boy approached, and greeted his mother, and put his little arms round her neck, and kissed her with childish endearments, she was moved, her anger was checked, and her eyes were wet with the tears that gathered against her will
1974	metamorphoses	" But, realising that her mind was wavering through excess affection, she turned away from him, and turned to look at her sister’s face again, till, gazing at both in turn, she said ‘Why should the one be able to speak his endearments, while the other is silent, her tongue torn out? Though he calls me mother, why can she not call me sister? Look at the husband you are bride to, Pandion’s daughter! This is unworthy of you! Affection is criminal in a wife of Tereus’
"
1975	metamorphoses	Without delay, she dragged Itys off, as a tigress does an un-weaned fawn, in the dark forests of the Ganges
1976	metamorphoses	 As they reached a remote part of the great palace, Procne, with an unchanging expression, struck him with a knife, in the side close to the heart, while he stretched out his hands, knowing his fate at the last, crying out ‘Mother! Mother!’, and reaching out for her neck
1977	metamorphoses	 That one wound was probably enough to seal his fate, but Philomela opened his throat with the knife
1978	metamorphoses	 While the limbs were still warm, and retained some life, they tore them to pieces
1979	metamorphoses	 Part bubble in bronze cauldrons, part hiss on the spit: and the distant rooms drip with grease
1980	metamorphoses	The wife invites the unsuspecting Tereus to the feast, and giving out that it is a sacred rite, practised in her country, where it is only lawful for the husband to be present, she sends away their followers and servants
1981	metamorphoses	 Tereus eats by himself, seated in his tall ancestral chair, and fills his belly with his own child
1982	metamorphoses	 And in the darkness of his understanding cries ‘Fetch Itys here’
1983	metamorphoses	Procne cannot hide her cruel exultation, and now, eager to be, herself, the messenger of destruction, she cries ‘You have him there, inside, the one you ask for
1984	metamorphoses	’ He looks around and questions where the boy is
1985	metamorphoses	 And then while he is calling out and seeking him, Philomela, springs forward, her hair wet with the dew of that frenzied murder, and hurls the bloodstained head of Itys in his father’s face
1986	metamorphoses	 Nor was there a time when she wished more strongly to have the power of speech, and to declare her exultation in fitting words
1987	metamorphoses	The Thracian king pushed back the table with a great cry, calling on the Furies, the snake-haired sisters of the vale of Styx
1988	metamorphoses	 Now if he could, he would tear open his body, and reveal the dreadful substance of the feast, and his half-consumed child
1989	metamorphoses	 Then he weeps, and calls himself the sepulchre of his unhappy son, and now pursues, with naked sword, the daughters of Pandion
1990	metamorphoses	You might think the Athenian women have taken wing: they have taken wings
1991	metamorphoses	 One of them, a nightingale, Procne, makes for the woods
1992	metamorphoses	 The other, a swallow, Philomela, flies to the eaves of the palace, and even now her throat has not lost the stain of that murder, and the soft down bears witness to the blood
1993	metamorphoses	 Tereus swift in his grief and desire for revenge, is himself changed to a bird, with a feathered crest on its head
1994	metamorphoses	 An immoderate, elongated, beak juts out, like a long spear
1995	metamorphoses	 The name of the bird is the hoopoe, and it looks as though it is armed
1996	metamorphoses	This tragedy sent Pandion down to the shadows of Tartarus before his time, before the last years of old age
1997	metamorphoses	 His rule over the kingdom, and his wealth passed to Erectheus, whose ability for sound government, and superiority in warfare, was never in doubt
1998	metamorphoses	 He had four sons and the same number of daughters, and two of the daughters were rivals in beauty
1999	metamorphoses	 Of these two, Procris made you happy in marriage, Cephalus, grandson of Aeolus
2000	metamorphoses	 But you, Boreas, god of the north wind, were long denied your beloved, Orithyia, harmed by your origins, with Tereus, among the Thracians
2001	metamorphoses	This was so while Boreas wooed her, and preferred prayers to force
2002	metamorphoses	 But when charm got him nowhere, he bristled with anger, which is his usual mood for too much of the time, and said ‘I deserve it! Why have I relinquished my own weapons, force and ferocity, and anger and menacing moods, and turned to prayers, that are unbecoming for me to use? Force is fitting for me
2003	metamorphoses	 By force, I drive forward the mists, by force move the sea
2004	metamorphoses	 I overturn knotted oaks, harden the snow, and strike earth with hail
2005	metamorphoses	 And, when I meet my brothers under the open sky (since that is my battleground) I struggle so fiercely with them that the midst of the heavens echoes with our collisions, and lightning leaps, hurled from the vaulted clouds
2006	metamorphoses	 So, when I penetrate the hollow openings of the earth, and apply my proud back to the deepest cave roofs, I trouble the shades, and the whole world with the tremors
2007	metamorphoses	 That is how I should have sought a wife, and not become Erectheus’s son-in-law by prayer but by action
2008	metamorphoses	"’
"
2009	metamorphoses	With these, or other equally forceful words, Boreas unfurled his wings, by whose beating the whole world is stirred, and made the wide ocean tremble
2010	metamorphoses	 Trailing his cloak of dust over the mountain summits, he swept the land, and, shrouded in darkness, the lover embraced his Orithyia, with his dusky wings, as she shivered with fear
2011	metamorphoses	 As he flew, his own flames of passion were fanned, and burned fiercer
2012	metamorphoses	 Nor did the thief halt in his flight through the air, till he reached the walls of the city and people of Thrace, the Cicones
2013	metamorphoses	There the girl from Attica married the chilly tyrant, and became a mother, giving birth to twin brothers, who took after their mother, in everything else but their father’s wings
2014	metamorphoses	 Yet they say the wings were not present, on their bodies, when they were born, but while they still were lacking beards, to match their red hair, Calais, and Zetes, as boys, were wingless
2015	metamorphoses	 But both alike, soon after, began to sprout the pinions of birds on their shoulders, and both their jaws and cheeks grew tawny
2016	metamorphoses	 And, when their boyhood was over, the youths sailed, as Argonauts, with the Minyans, in that first ship, through unknown seas, to seek the glittering wool of a golden fleece
2017	metamorphoses	And now the Argonauts were ploughing through the sea in their ship, built in Thessalian Pagasae
2018	metamorphoses	 They had visited Phineus, king of Thracian Salmydessus, living out a useless old age in perpetual blindness, and the winged sons of Boreas had driven the birdlike Harpies from the presence of the unhappy, aged man
2019	metamorphoses	 At last, after enduring many trials, under their famous leader, Jason, they reached the turbulent river-waters of the muddy Phasis, in the land of Colchis
2020	metamorphoses	 While they were standing before King Aeetes, of Aea, requesting the return of the Golden Fleece, taken from the divine ram that carried Phrixus, and while extreme terms were being imposed, involving daunting tasks, Medea, the daughter of the king, conceived an overwhelming passion for Jason
2021	metamorphoses	 She fought against it for a time, but when reason could not overcome desire, she debated with herself
2022	metamorphoses	‘Medea, you struggle in vain: some god, I do not know which, opposes you
2023	metamorphoses	 I wonder if this, or something, like this, is what people indeed call love? Or why would the tasks my father demands of Jason seem so hard? They are more than hard! Why am I afraid of his death, when I have scarcely seen him? What is the cause of all this fear? Quench, if you can, unhappy girl, these flames that you feel in your virgin heart! If I could, I would be wiser! But a strange power draws me to him against my will
2024	metamorphoses	 Love urges one thing: reason another
2025	metamorphoses	 I see, and I desire the better: I follow the worse
2026	metamorphoses	 Why do you burn for a stranger, royal virgin, and dream of marriage in an alien land? This earth can also give you what you can love
2027	metamorphoses	 Whether he lives or dies, is in the hands of the gods
2028	metamorphoses	" Let him live! I can pray for this even if I may not love him: what is Jason guilty of? Who, but the heartless, would not be touched by Jason’s youth, and birth, and courage? Who, though the other qualities were absent, could not be stirred by his beauty?
"
2029	metamorphoses	He has stirred my heart, indeed
2030	metamorphoses	 And unless I offer my help, he will feel the fiery breath of the bronze-footed bulls; have to meet that enemy, sprung from the soil, born of his own sowing; or be given as captured prey to the dragon’s greed
2031	metamorphoses	 If I allow this, then I am born of the tigress: then I show I have a heart of stone and iron! Why can I not watch him die, and shame my eyes by seeing? Why do I not urge the bulls on, to meet him, and the wild earth-born warriors, and the unsleeping dragon? Let the gods also desire the better! Though it is not for me to pray for, but to bring about
2032	metamorphoses	Shall I betray my father’s country? Shall some unknown be saved by my powers, and unhurt because of me, without me, set his sails to the wind, and be husband to another, leaving Medea to be punished? If he could do that, if he could set another woman above me, let him die, the ungrateful man! But his look, his nobility of spirit, and his graceful form, do not make me fear deceit or forgetfulness of my kindness
2033	metamorphoses	 And he will give me his word beforehand, and I will gather the gods to witness our pledge
2034	metamorphoses	 Why fear when it is certain? Prepare yourself, and dispel all delay: Jason will be for ever in your debt, take you to himself in sacred marriage, and through the cities of Pelasgian Greece, the crowds of women will glorify you as his saviour
2035	metamorphoses	Carried by the winds, shall I leave my native country, my sister, my brother, my father, and my gods? Well then, my father is barbarous, and my country is savage, and my brother is still a child: my sister’s prayers are for me, and the greatest god is within! I will not be leaving greatness behind, but pursuing greatness: honour as a saviour of these Achaean people, familiarity with a better land and with cities whose fame is flourishing even here, the culture and arts of those places, and the man, the son of Aeson, for whom I would barter those things that the wide world owns, joined to whom I will be called fortunate, dear to the gods, and my head will be crowned with the stars
2036	metamorphoses	What of the stories of mountains that clash together in mid-ocean, and Charybdis the bane of sailors, now sucking in, now spewing out the sea, and rapacious dog-headed Scylla, yelping over the Sicilian deeps? Well, holding what I love, clinging to Jason’s breast, I shall be carried over the wide seas: in his arms, I will fear nothing, or if I am afraid, I will only be afraid for him
2037	metamorphoses	But do you call that marriage, Medea, and clothe your fault with fair names? Consider instead, how great a sin you are near to, and while you can, shun the crime!’ She spoke, and in front of her eyes, were rectitude, piety, modesty: and now, Cupid, defeated, was turning away
2038	metamorphoses	She went to the ancient altars of Hecate, daughter of the Titan Perses, that the shadowy grove conceals, in the remote forest
2039	metamorphoses	 And now she was strong and her passion, now conquered, had ebbed, when she saw the son of Aeson and the flame, that was dead, relit
2040	metamorphoses	 Her cheeks flushed, and then her whole face became pallid
2041	metamorphoses	 Just as a tiny spark that lies buried under the ashes, takes life from a breath of air, and grows and, living, regains its previous strength, so now her calmed passion, that you would have thought had dulled, when she saw the young hero, flared up at his visible presence
2042	metamorphoses	It chanced that Aeson’s son was more than usually handsome that day: you could forgive her for loving him
2043	metamorphoses	 She gazed at him, and fixed her eyes on him as if she had never looked at him before, and in her infatuation, seeing his face, could not believe him mortal, nor could she turn away
2044	metamorphoses	 So that when, indeed, the stranger grasped her right hand, and began to speak, and in a submissive voice asked for her help, promising marriage, she replied in a flood of tears
2045	metamorphoses	 ‘I see what I am doing: it is not ignorance of the truth that ensnares me, but love
2046	metamorphoses	" Your salvation is in my gift, but being saved, remember your promise!’
"
2047	metamorphoses	He swore by the sacred rites of the Triple Goddess, by the divine presence of the grove, by the all-seeing Sun, who was the father of King Aeetes, his father-in-law to be, and by his own good fortune, and by his great danger
2048	metamorphoses	 Immediately, as he was now trusted, he accepted the magic herbs from her, and learnt their use, and returned to the palace, joyfully
2049	metamorphoses	The next day’s dawn dispelled the glittering stars
2050	metamorphoses	 Then the people gathered on the sacred field of Mars and took up their position on the ridge
2051	metamorphoses	 The king was seated in the middle, clothed in purple, and distinguished by his ivory sceptre
2052	metamorphoses	 Behold, the bronze-footed bulls, breathing Vulcan’s fire from nostrils of steel
2053	metamorphoses	 At the touch of their heat the grass shrivels, and as stoked fires roar, or as broken limestone, that has absorbed the heat inside an earthen furnace, hisses explosively, when cool water is scattered over it, so the flames sounded, pent up in their heaving chests and burning throats
2054	metamorphoses	 Still the son of Aeson went out to meet them
2055	metamorphoses	As he came to them, the fierce creatures, with their iron-tipped horns, turned their terrible gaze towards him, pawed the dusty ground with their cloven feet, and filled the air with the steam of their bellowing
2056	metamorphoses	 The Minyans were frozen in fear
2057	metamorphoses	 He went up to the bulls, not feeling their fiery breath (so great is the power of magic drugs!), and stroking their hanging dewlaps, with a bold hand, yoked them together, and forced them to pull the heavy blade, and till the virgin field with the iron plough
2058	metamorphoses	 The Colchians were stunned, but the Argonauts increased their shouting, and heightened his courage
2059	metamorphoses	Then he took the dragon’s teeth from the bronze helmet, and scattered them over the turned earth
2060	metamorphoses	 The soil softened the seeds that had been steeped in virulent poison, and they sprouted, and the teeth, freshly sown, produced new bodies
2061	metamorphoses	 As an embryo takes on human form in the mother’s womb, and is fully developed there in every aspect, not emerging to the living air until it is complete, so when those shapes of men had been made in the bowels of the pregnant earth, they surged from the teeming soil, and, what is even more wonderful, clashed weapons, created with them
2062	metamorphoses	 The Pelasgians’ faces fell in fear, and their courage failed them, when they saw these warriors preparing to hurl their sharp spears, at the head of the Haemonian hero
2063	metamorphoses	 She also, who had rendered him safe, was afraid
2064	metamorphoses	 When she saw the solitary youth attacked by so many enemies, she grew pale, and sat there, suddenly cold and bloodless
2065	metamorphoses	 And in case the herbs she had given him had not been potent enough, she chanted a spell to support them, and called on her secret arts
2066	metamorphoses	He threw a boulder into the midst of his enemies, and this turned their attack, on him, against themselves
2067	metamorphoses	 The earth-born brothers died at each other’s hands, and fell as in civil war
2068	metamorphoses	 The Achaeans cheered, and clung to the victor, and hugged him in eager embraces
2069	metamorphoses	 You also, princess among the Barbarians, longed to hold the victorious man: but modesty prevented it
2070	metamorphoses	 Still, you might have held him, but concern for your reputation stopped you from doing so
2071	metamorphoses	 What you might fittingly do you did, rejoicing silently, giving thanks, for your incantations, and the gods who inspired them
2072	metamorphoses	The final task was to put the dragon to sleep with the magic drugs
2073	metamorphoses	 Known for its crest, its triple tongues and curved fangs, it was the dread guardian of the tree’s gold
2074	metamorphoses	 But when Jason had sprinkled it with the Lethean juice of a certain herb, and three times repeated the words that bring tranquil sleep, that calm the rough seas and turbulent rivers, sleep came to those sleepless eyes, and the heroic son of Aeson gained the Golden Fleece
2075	metamorphoses	 Proud of his prize, and taking with him a further prize, the one who had helped him gain it, the hero, and his wife Medea, returned to the harbour at Iolchos
2076	metamorphoses	The elderly Haemonian mothers and fathers bring offerings to mark their sons’ return, and melt incense heaped in the flames
2077	metamorphoses	 The sacrifice, with gilded horns, that they have dedicated, is led in and killed
2078	metamorphoses	 But Aeson is absent from the rejoicing, now near death, and weary with the long years
2079	metamorphoses	 Then Jason, his son, said ‘O my wife, to whom I confess I owe my life, though you have already given me everything, and the total of all your kindnesses is beyond any promises we made, let your incantations, if they can (what indeed can they not do?) reduce my own years and add them to my father’s!’ He could not restrain his tears
2080	metamorphoses	 Medea was moved by the loving request, and the contrast with Aeetes, abandoned by her, came to mind
2081	metamorphoses	 Yet, not allowing herself to be affected by such thoughts, she answered ‘Husband, what dreadful words have escaped your lips? Do you think I can transfer any part of your life to another? Hecate would not allow it: nor is yours a just request
2082	metamorphoses	 But I will try to grant a greater gift than the one you ask for, Jason
2083	metamorphoses	 If only the Triple Goddess will aid me, and give her assent in person to this great act of daring, I will attempt to renew your father’s length of years, without need for yours
2084	metamorphoses	"’
"
2085	metamorphoses	Three nights were lacking before the moon’s horns met, to make their complete orb
2086	metamorphoses	 When it was shining at its fullest, and gazed on the earth, with perfect form, Medea left the palace, dressed in unclasped robes
2087	metamorphoses	 Her feet were bare, her unbound hair streamed down, over her shoulders, and she wandered, companionless, through midnight’s still silence
2088	metamorphoses	 Men, beasts, and birds were freed in deep sleep
2089	metamorphoses	 There were no murmurs in the hedgerows: the still leaves were silent, in silent, dew-filled, air
2090	metamorphoses	 Only the flickering stars moved
2091	metamorphoses	" Stretching her arms to them she three times turned herself about, three times sprinkled her head, with water from the running stream, three times let out a wailing cry, then knelt on the hard earth, and prayed:
"
2092	metamorphoses	"‘Night, most faithful keeper of our secret rites;
"
2093	metamorphoses	"Stars, that, with the golden moon, succeed the fires of light;
"
2094	metamorphoses	"Triple Hecate, you who know all our undertakings,
"
2095	metamorphoses	"and come, to aid the witches’ art, and all our incantations:
"
2096	metamorphoses	"You, Earth, who yield the sorceress herbs of magic force:
"
2097	metamorphoses	"You, airs and breezes, pools and hills, and every watercourse;
"
2098	metamorphoses	Be here; all you Gods of Night, and Gods of Groves endorse
2099	metamorphoses	Streams, at will, by banks amazed, turn backwards to their source
2100	metamorphoses	"I calm rough seas, and stir the calm by my magic spells:
"
2101	metamorphoses	"bring clouds, disperse the clouds, raise storms and storms dispel;
"
2102	metamorphoses	"and, with my incantations, I break the serpent’s teeth;
"
2103	metamorphoses	"and root up nature’s oaks, and rocks, from their native heath;
"
2104	metamorphoses	"and move the forests, and command the mountain tops to shake,
"
2105	metamorphoses	earth to groan, and from their tombs the sleeping dead to wake
2106	metamorphoses	"You also, Luna, I draw down, eclipsed, from heaven’s stain,
"
2107	metamorphoses	"though bronzes of Temese clash, to take away your pains;
"
2108	metamorphoses	"and at my chant, the chariot of the Sun-god, my grandsire,
"
2109	metamorphoses	grows pale: Aurora, at my poisons, dims her morning fire
2110	metamorphoses	"You quench the bulls’ hot flame for me: force their necks to bow,
"
2111	metamorphoses	"beneath the heavy yoke, that never pulled the curving plough:
"
2112	metamorphoses	"You turn the savage warfare, born of the serpent’s teeth,
"
2113	metamorphoses	"against itself, and lull the watcher, innocent of sleep;
"
2114	metamorphoses	that guard deceived, bring golden spoil, to the towns of Greece
2115	metamorphoses	"Now I need the juice by which old age may be renewed,
"
2116	metamorphoses	"that can regain the prime of years, return the flower of youth,
"
2117	metamorphoses	and You will grant it
2118	metamorphoses	" Not in vain, stars glittered in reply:
"
2119	metamorphoses	not in vain, winged dragons bring my chariot, through the sky
2120	metamorphoses	"’
"
2121	metamorphoses	There, sent from the sky, was her chariot
2122	metamorphoses	 When she had mounted, stroked the dragons’ bridled necks, and shaken the light reins in her hands, she was snatched up on high
2123	metamorphoses	 She looked down on Thessalian Tempe far below, and sent the dragons to certain places that she knew
2124	metamorphoses	 She considered those herbs that grow on Mount Ossa, those of Mount Pelion, Othrys and Pindus, and higher Olympus, and of those that pleased her, plucked some by the roots, and cut others, with a curved pruning-knife of bronze
2125	metamorphoses	 Many she chose, as well, from the banks of the Apidanus
2126	metamorphoses	 Many she chose, as well, from the Amphrysus
2127	metamorphoses	 Nor did she omit the Enipeus
2128	metamorphoses	 Peneus, and Spercheus’s waters gave something, and the reedy shores of Boebe
2129	metamorphoses	 And at Anthedon, by Euboea, she picked a plant of long life, not yet famous for the change it made in Glaucus’s body
2130	metamorphoses	 Then she returned, after nine days and nine nights surveying all the lands she had crossed, from her chariot, drawn by the winged dragons
2131	metamorphoses	 The dragons had only smelt the herbs, yet they shed their skins of many years
2132	metamorphoses	 Reaching her door and threshold, she stopped on the outside, and under the open sky, avoiding contact with any man, she set up two altars of turf, one on the right to Hecate, one on the left to Youth
2133	metamorphoses	 She wreathed them with sacred boughs from the wildwood, then dug two trenches near by in the earth, and performed the sacrifice, plunging her knife into the throat of a black-fleeced sheep, and drenching the wide ditches with blood
2134	metamorphoses	 She poured over it cups of pure honey, and again she poured over it cups of warm milk, uttering words as she did so, calling on the spirits of the earth, and begging the shadowy king and his stolen bride, not to be too quick to steal life from the old man’s limbs
2135	metamorphoses	When she had appeased the gods by prayer and murmured a while, she ordered Aeson’s exhausted body to be carried into the air, and freeing him to deep sleep with her spells, she stretched him out like a corpse on a bed of herbs
2136	metamorphoses	 She ordered Jason, his son, to go far off, and the attendants to go far off, and warned them to keep profane eyes away from the mysteries
2137	metamorphoses	 They went as she had ordered
2138	metamorphoses	 Medea, with streaming hair, circled the burning altars, like a Bacchante, and dipping many-branched torches into the black ditches filled with blood, she lit them, once they were darkened, at the twin altars
2139	metamorphoses	 Three times with fire, three times with water, three times with sulphur, she purified the old man
2140	metamorphoses	Meanwhile a potent mixture is heating in a bronze cauldron set on the flames, bubbling, and seething, white with turbulent froth
2141	metamorphoses	 She boils there, roots dug from a Thessalian valley, seeds, flowerheads, and dark juices
2142	metamorphoses	 She throws in precious stones searched for in the distant east, and sands that the ebbing tide of ocean washes
2143	metamorphoses	 She adds hoar-frost collected by night under the moon, the wings and flesh of a vile screech-owl, and the slavering foam of a sacrificed were-wolf, that can change its savage features to those of a man
2144	metamorphoses	 She does not forget the scaly skin of a thin Cinyphian water-snake, the liver of a long-lived stag, the eggs and the head of a crow that has lived for nine human life-times
2145	metamorphoses	With these, and a thousand other nameless things, the barbarian witch pursued her greater than mortal purpose
2146	metamorphoses	 She stirred it all with a long-dry branch of a fruitful olive, mixing the depths with the surface
2147	metamorphoses	 Look! The ancient staff turned in the hot cauldron, first grew green again, then in a short time sprouted leaves, and was, suddenly, heavily loaded with olives
2148	metamorphoses	 And whenever the flames caused froth to spatter from the hollow bronze, and warm drops to fall on the earth, the soil blossomed, and flowers and soft grasses grew
2149	metamorphoses	As soon as she saw this, Medea unsheathed a knife, and cut the old man’s throat, and letting the old blood out, filled the dry veins with the juice
2150	metamorphoses	 When Aeson had absorbed it, part through his mouth, and part through the wound, the white of his hair and beard quickly vanished, and a dark colour took its place
2151	metamorphoses	 At a stroke his leanness went, and his pallor and dullness of mind
2152	metamorphoses	 The deep hollows were filled with rounded flesh, and his limbs expanded
2153	metamorphoses	 Aeson marvelled, recalling that this was his self of forty years ago
2154	metamorphoses	Bacchus saw this wondrous miracle from heaven’s heights, and realising from it, that the Nymphs of Mount Nysa, who had nursed him, could have their youth restored, he secured that gift from the witch of Colchis
2155	metamorphoses	 There was no end to her magic
2156	metamorphoses	 Phasian Medea, pretending to a sham quarrel with her husband, fled as a suppliant to Pelias’s threshold, he who had usurped Aeson’s throne
2157	metamorphoses	 There, the king’s daughters received her, since he himself was weighed down by the years
2158	metamorphoses	 The lying Colchian soon won them over by a skilful show of friendship, and when she told them of one of her greatest gifts, the removal of Aeson’s many years, and lingered over it, hope was aroused in Pelias’s daughters that similar magic arts might rejuvenate their father
2159	metamorphoses	They begged her, and told her to set a price however great
2160	metamorphoses	 She was silent for a moment, and appeared to hesitate, keeping the minds of her petitioners in suspense by a show of solemn pretence
2161	metamorphoses	 When, eventually, she promised to do it, she said ‘To give you greater confidence in my gift, your oldest ram, the leader of your flocks, will by turned into a young lamb again, by my magic drugs
2162	metamorphoses	’ Straight away the woolly creature, worn out by innumerable years, was dragged forward, his horns curving round his hollow temples
2163	metamorphoses	 When the witch had cut his wizened throat with her Thessalian knife, hardly staining the blade with blood, she immersed the sheep’s carcass in the bronze cauldron, along with her powerful magic herbs
2164	metamorphoses	 These shrank its limbs, melted away its horns, and, with its horns, the years
2165	metamorphoses	 A high-pitched bleating came from inside the vessel, and while they were wondering at the bleating, a lamb leapt out, and frisked away, seeking the udder and milk
2166	metamorphoses	Pelias’s daughters were stunned, and now the truth of her promise had been displayed, they insisted even more eagerly
2167	metamorphoses	 Three times Phoebus had unyoked his horses, after their plunge into the western ocean, and on the fourth night the stars were glittering in all their radiance, when the deceitful daughter of Aeetes set clear water, and herbs, but ineffectual ones, over a blazing fire
2168	metamorphoses	 And now the king and his guards also were deep in death-like sleep, achieved by her incantations and the power of her magic spells
2169	metamorphoses	 The king’s daughters, at her command, crossed the threshold, with the Colchian witch, and stood around his bed
2170	metamorphoses	 ‘Why do you hesitate, so timidly?’ she said
2171	metamorphoses	 ‘Un-sheath your blades, and let out the old blood, so that I can fill the empty veins with new! Your father’s life and youth are in your hands
2172	metamorphoses	" If you have any filial affection, if those are not vain hopes that stir you, render your father this service, banish old age with your weapons, and drive out his poisoned blood with a stroke of the iron blade!’
"
2173	metamorphoses	Urged on by these words, the more love each had for him, the quicker she was to act without love, and did evil, to avoid greater evil
2174	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless they could not bear to see their own blows, and turned their eyes away, and with averted faces, wounded him blindly with cruel hands
2175	metamorphoses	 Streaming blood, the old man still raised himself on his elbow, and, though mutilated, tried to rise from his bed
2176	metamorphoses	 Stretching his pallid hands out among the many weapons, he cried ‘Daughters, why are you doing this? What has made you take up weapons against your father’s life?’ Their strength and courage vanished
2177	metamorphoses	 But as he was about to utter more words, the Colchian witch cut his throat, and plunged his torn body into the seething water
2178	metamorphoses	She would not have escaped punishment had she not taken to the air, with her winged dragons
2179	metamorphoses	 Through the high sky, clockwise, she fled, over the shadowy slopes of Pelion, Chiron’s home; over Othrys and the places made famous by the ancient fate of Cerambus, who, aided by the nymphs and changed to a winged scarab beetle, lifted into the air, when the all-powerful sea drowned the solid earth, and so escaped un-drowned from Deucalion’s flood
2180	metamorphoses	 She passed Aeolian Pitane on the left, with its huge stone serpent image, and Ida’s grove where Liber concealed, in the deceptive shape of a stag, the bullock stolen by his son
2181	metamorphoses	 She passed the place where the father of Corythus, Paris, lay, buried under a little sand; and where Hecuba, changed to a black bitch of Hecate, Maera, spread terror through the fields with her strange barking
2182	metamorphoses	She flew over Astypalaea, the city of Eurypylus, where the women of the island, of Cos, acquired horns when they abused Hercules, as he and his company departed: over Rhodes, beloved of Phoebus: and the Telchines of the city of Ialysos on Rhodes, whose eyes corrupted everything they looked on, so that Jupiter, disgusted with them, sank them under his brother’s ocean waves
2183	metamorphoses	 She passed the walls of ancient Carthaea, on the island of Ceos, where Alcidamas, as a father, would marvel, one day, that a peace-loving dove could spring from the body of his daughter, Ctesylla
2184	metamorphoses	Then she saw Lake Hyrie, and Cycnean Tempe, made famous suddenly by a swan
2185	metamorphoses	 There Phylius, at the boy Cycnus’s command, brought him birds and a fierce lion he had tamed
2186	metamorphoses	 Ordered to overcome a wild bull as well, he did overcome him, but angry that his love was rejected so often, he refused to grant this last gift of a bull, when asked
2187	metamorphoses	 Cycnus, angered, said ‘You will wish you had’ and leapt from a high cliff
2188	metamorphoses	 All thought he had fallen, but changed to a swan he beat through the air on white wings, though his mother, Hyrie, not knowing he was safe, pined away with weeping, and became the lake that carries her name
2189	metamorphoses	Near there was the city of Pleuron, where Combe the daughter of Ophius, on flickering wings, escaped death at the hands of her sons, the Aetolian Curetes
2190	metamorphoses	 And then Medea looked down at the fields of Calaurea’s isle, sacred to Leto, whose king and queen were also changed to birds
2191	metamorphoses	 On her right was Cyllene, where Menephron lay with his mother, as though he were a wild beast
2192	metamorphoses	 Further on she sees the Cephisus, the river-god lamenting his grandson’s fate, changed by Apollo into a lumbering seal, and the home of Eumelus, mourning his son Botres, reborn as a bird, the bee-eater, in the air
2193	metamorphoses	At last, the dragon’s wings brought her to Corinth, the ancient Ephyre, and its Pirenian spring
2194	metamorphoses	 Here, tradition says, that in earliest times, human bodies sprang from fungi, swollen by rain
2195	metamorphoses	 After Jason’s new bride Glauce had been consumed by the fires of vengeful Colchian witchcraft and both the Isthmus’s gulfs had witnessed flame consuming the king’s palace, Medea impiously bathed her sword in the blood of their sons
2196	metamorphoses	 Then, after performing this evil act, she fled from Jason’s wrath
2197	metamorphoses	 Carried by her dragons that are born of the Titans, she reached Pallas’s citadel of Athens
2198	metamorphoses	 This once knew you Phene, the most righteous, and you old Periphas, both flying in the air, as birds, the eagle and the osprey: and Alcyone, granddaughter of Polypemon, resting on strange new wings
2199	metamorphoses	 It was Aegeus who gave Medea sanctuary there, damned thereafter by that one action: and not content with taking her in, he even entered into a contract of marriage with her
2200	metamorphoses	Now Theseus came to Athens, Aegeus’s son, but as yet unknown to him
2201	metamorphoses	 He, by his courage, had brought peace to the Isthmus between the two gulfs
2202	metamorphoses	 Medea, seeking his destruction, prepared a mixture of poisonous aconite, she had brought with her from the coast of Scythia
2203	metamorphoses	 This poison is said to have dripped from the teeth of Cerberus, the Echidnean dog
2204	metamorphoses	 There is a dark cavern with a gaping mouth, and a path into the depths, up which Hercules, hero of Tiryns, dragged the dog, tied with steel chains, resisting and twisting its eyes away from the daylight and the shining rays
2205	metamorphoses	 Cerberus, provoked to a rabid frenzy, filled all the air with his simultaneous three-headed howling, and spattered the green fields with white flecks of foam
2206	metamorphoses	 These are supposed to have congealed and found food to multiply, gaining harmful strength from the rich soil
2207	metamorphoses	 Because they are long-lived, springing from the hard rock, the country people call these shoots, of wolf-bane, ‘soil-less’ aconites
2208	metamorphoses	 Through his wife’s cunning Aegeus, the father, himself offered the poison to his son, as if he were a stranger
2209	metamorphoses	 Theseus, unwittingly, had taken the cup he was given in his right hand, when his father recognised the emblems of his own house, on the ivory hilt of his son’s sword, and knocked the evil drink away from his mouth
2210	metamorphoses	 But she escaped death, in a dark mist, raised by her incantations
2211	metamorphoses	Though the father was overjoyed that his son was unharmed, he was still horrified that so great a crime could have come so close to success
2212	metamorphoses	 He lit fires on the altars, and heaped gifts for the gods
2213	metamorphoses	 His axes struck the mountainous necks of oxen, their horns tied with the sacrificial ribbons
2214	metamorphoses	 They say that was the happiest day that dawned in the city of Erectheus
2215	metamorphoses	 The statesmen celebrated among the people, and they sang verses, made even more inspired by the wine
2216	metamorphoses	"‘Great Theseus, admired in Marathon,
"
2217	metamorphoses	"for the blood of the Cretan bull,
"
2218	metamorphoses	"your act and gift made Cromyon’s fields
"
2219	metamorphoses	safe for the farmers plough
2220	metamorphoses	"Epidaurus’s land saw you defeat
"
2221	metamorphoses	"Vulcan’s club-wielding son,
"
2222	metamorphoses	"and the banks of the River Cephisus
"
2223	metamorphoses	saw evil Procrustes brought down
2224	metamorphoses	"Eleusis, sacred to Ceres the Mother,
"
2225	metamorphoses	"witnessed Cercyon’s fall:
"
2226	metamorphoses	"Sinis, you killed, a man of great strength
"
2227	metamorphoses	"twisted to evil art,
"
2228	metamorphoses	"who could bend pine-tree trunks to the earth,
"
2229	metamorphoses	"and tear men’s bodies apart:
"
2230	metamorphoses	"and Sciron is done for, and safe paths reach
"
2231	metamorphoses	"Megara’s Lelegeïan wall:
"
2232	metamorphoses	"though the ocean denied his bones a grave,
"
2233	metamorphoses	"and the land denied the same,
"
2234	metamorphoses	"till, long-time hurled, they hardened to cliffs,
"
2235	metamorphoses	and the cliffs bear Sciron’s name
2236	metamorphoses	"If we wanted to count your years and your honours,
"
2237	metamorphoses	"the deeds would exceed the years:
"
2238	metamorphoses	"to you, the bravest, we empty our wine-cups,
"
2239	metamorphoses	and offer our public prayers
2240	metamorphoses	"’
"
2241	metamorphoses	The palace echoed to the people’s applause and the prayers of friends, and there was no sad place in the whole city
2242	metamorphoses	Nevertheless Aegeus’s pleasure in receiving his son was not carefree (indeed, joy is never complete, and some trouble always comes to spoil our delight)
2243	metamorphoses	 Minos, of Crete, was preparing for war
2244	metamorphoses	 Powerful in men and ships, his anger as a father was more powerful still, and by right of arms he was seeking to avenge the death of Androgeos, his son
2245	metamorphoses	 But first he acquired allies for his war, crossing the sea in the swift fleet that was his strength
2246	metamorphoses	 The island of Anaphe joined with him, and that of Astypalaea (Anaphe by promises, Astypalaea by Cretan supremacy in war); low-lying Myconos, and chalky-soiled Cimolos; Syros flowering with thyme, flat Seriphos, marble-cliffed Paros, and Siphnos, betrayed to him by that disloyal princess, Arne, whom, when she had taken the gold her greed demanded, the gods changed into a bird, the black-footed, black-winged jackdaw, that still delights in gold
2247	metamorphoses	But Oliaros gave no aid to the Cretan ships; nor Didyme, Tenos, Andros, Gyaros; nor Peparethos rich in bright olives
2248	metamorphoses	 Sailing northwest Minos sought Oenopia, the kingdom of the Aeacidae
2249	metamorphoses	 They called it Oenopia in ancient times, but Aeacus himself named it Aegina after his mother
2250	metamorphoses	 The crowd rushed down, to meet Minos, wanting to see so famous a man
2251	metamorphoses	 Telamon went to him, and Peleus, junior to Telamon, and Phocus, the third child, their half-brother
2252	metamorphoses	 Aeacus himself came, also, slow with the burden of years, and asked the cause of his visit
2253	metamorphoses	 The ruler of a hundred cities sighed, reminded of his grief for his son, and replied ‘I beg your aid in a war, waged for my son’s sake; to be part of a just fight: I ask the comfort of marking out his tomb
2254	metamorphoses	’ The grandson of Asopus said ‘You ask in vain what my city cannot give
2255	metamorphoses	 No city is more closely linked to Athens, city of Cecrops, than this; we and they are bound by treaty
2256	metamorphoses	"’
"
2257	metamorphoses	Minos turned away, sadly, saying ‘Your treaty will cost you dear’, since he thought it more useful to threaten war than to fight, and consume his strength too soon
2258	metamorphoses	 The Cretan fleet could still be seen from Aegina’s walls, when a ship from Athens arrived, under full sail, and entered the allied port, bearing Cephalus, and likewise greetings from his country
2259	metamorphoses	 Though they had not seen him for a long time, the sons of Aeacus still knew him, and clasped his right hand, and led him to their father’s house
2260	metamorphoses	 The hero went forward, observed on all sides, even now retaining traces of his former beauty, carrying a branch of his country’s olive
2261	metamorphoses	 And to right and left, he, the elder, had two younger men, Clytos and Butes, the sons of Pallas
2262	metamorphoses	After meeting and exchanging a few words, Cephalus described his mandate from Athens, asking for help and quoting the treaty sworn to by their ancestors, adding that Minos was out to control all Achaia
2263	metamorphoses	 When he had invoked the treaty, in this way, to aid his cause, Aeacus, resting his left hand on the handle of his sceptre, replied ‘Don’t ask for our help, assume it
2264	metamorphoses	 Don’t hesitate to reckon the forces of this island your own, and (let this state of my fortunes last!) energy is not lacking
2265	metamorphoses	 I have men enough, and thank the gods, the moment is auspicious and there will be no excuses
2266	metamorphoses	’ ‘I wish it may always be so’ Cephalus said ‘and may your city swell its numbers
2267	metamorphoses	 Indeed, as I came I felt happy: so many equally youthful, handsome people, meeting me on the way
2268	metamorphoses	 Yet there were many I missed, that I saw before, when I visited the city
2269	metamorphoses	’ Aeacus sighed, and spoke sadly
2270	metamorphoses	 ‘From a bad beginning, better fortune follows
2271	metamorphoses	 I wish I could recall the one for you without the other! I’ll take them in order, now, and not stall you with irrelevances
2272	metamorphoses	" Those your mind, remembering, misses are only bones and ashes, and how great a part of my wealth perished with them!
"
2273	metamorphoses	A terrible plague afflicted the people through the unjust anger of Juno, detesting us because our island had been named after my mother, her rival
2274	metamorphoses	 While it looked like a human disease, and the cause of the disastrous epidemic was hidden, we fought it with medical skill
2275	metamorphoses	 But the destruction cancelled out our efforts, which waned as we were conquered
2276	metamorphoses	 At the outset the sky shrouded the earth in a thick fog, and held the sultry heat under clouds
2277	metamorphoses	 While Luna filled her horns four times to make her disc complete, and four times thinned her full disc away, hot southerly winds breathed their deadly air on us
2278	metamorphoses	 We know the pestilence reached our lakes and streams
2279	metamorphoses	 Thousands of snakes slithered through the empty fields, and fouled the waters with their slime
2280	metamorphoses	 The unexpected power of the disease surprised us, at the first, with its destruction of dogs, sheep and cattle, wild animals and birds
2281	metamorphoses	 The wretched ploughman watches in dismay as sturdy oxen stumble in their task, and sink down onto the furrows
2282	metamorphoses	 The flocks of sheep give out a sickly bleating, while the wool falls away of itself, and their bodies waste
2283	metamorphoses	 The spirited horse, once famous on the track, loses his glory, and forgetting past honour, whinnies in his stall, dying a slow death
2284	metamorphoses	 The wild boar no longer remembers his fury; the deer cannot trust to speed; the bears cannot match the strength of the herds
2285	metamorphoses	 Lethargy grips them all
2286	metamorphoses	 Decaying carcasses lie in the roadways, fields and woods, and the air is fouled with the stench
2287	metamorphoses	 Strangely, dogs, carrion birds, and grey wolves, will not touch them
2288	metamorphoses	 They rot on the ground, pollute the air with their dying breath, and spread contagion far and wide
2289	metamorphoses	Increasing in virulence the pestilence spreads to the luckless farmers themselves, and takes lordship inside the city walls
2290	metamorphoses	 Firstly the inner organs grow hot, and a flushed skin and feverish breath are symptoms of hidden warmth
2291	metamorphoses	 The tongue is rough and swollen with heat: the lips are parted, parched with dry breath, and gasping suck in the heavy air
2292	metamorphoses	 The sick cannot tolerate a bed or any kind of covering, but lie face down on the bare ground, though the earth does not cool their bodies, their bodies heat the earth
2293	metamorphoses	No one can control it, and it breaks out fiercely among the doctors themselves, and the practice of their skill condemns the practitioners
2294	metamorphoses	 The nearer people are to the sick, and the more selflessly they attend them, the more swiftly they meet their fate, and as the hope of recovery deserts them, and they see the end of their illness only in death, they give way to their desires, and ignore what is good for them, since nothing is any good
2295	metamorphoses	 Everywhere they cling to the fountains and runnels and deep wells, and drinking, thirst is not quenched sooner than life
2296	metamorphoses	 Many of them are too weak to stand, and even die in the water, yet others still draw it
2297	metamorphoses	 Others loathe their hateful beds so much they leave them, and if they lack the strength to stand, they roll out onto the ground
2298	metamorphoses	 They quit their household gods since their house seems fatal to them, and, because the cause is unknown, the building itself is blamed
2299	metamorphoses	 You see them, half-dead, wandering the streets, while they can still stay on their feet, others lying on the ground weeping, turning their exhausted gaze upwards in their dying efforts, and stretching their arms out to the stars in the overhanging sky, breathing their last, here or there, wherever death has overtaken them
2300	metamorphoses	What were my feelings then? What could they be, but to hate life, and to wish to be with my people? Wherever I looked as I turned my gaze, there were layers of dead, like rotten apples fallen from shaken branches, or acorns from a windblown ilex
2301	metamorphoses	 See that temple opposite on the hill with a flight of steps up to it? It is Jupiter’s
2302	metamorphoses	 Who among us did not bring useless offerings to those shrines? How often a husband while still praying for his wife, or a father still praying for his son, ended his life in front of those implacable altars, part of the unused incense found in their hands! How often the sacrificial bulls fell down, without waiting for the blow, while the priest was praying and pouring unmixed wine between the horns
2303	metamorphoses	 Even when I was sacrificing to Jove, for myself my country and my three sons, the victim let out a dreadful moan, and suddenly collapsed without a stroke from my blade, barely staining the knives below with its blood
2304	metamorphoses	 The diseased entrails showed no marks, from which to read the prophetic truths, and warnings, of the gods
2305	metamorphoses	 That offensive morbidity penetrated to their vital organs
2306	metamorphoses	 I have seen corpses thrown down in front of the temple doors, in front of the altars, to make their deaths even more of a reproach
2307	metamorphoses	 Some cut off their breath with a noose, and banished, by death, their fear of death, summoning their approaching fate from the beyond
2308	metamorphoses	The bodies of the dead were not given the usual rites (the exit gates from the city could not cope with so many funerals)
2309	metamorphoses	 They either lay on the ground unburied, or were given to the heaped pyres without ceremony
2310	metamorphoses	 And now there was no reverence left: the people struggled to the pyres, and were consumed by others’ flames
2311	metamorphoses	 There was no one left to mourn, and the spirits of parents and children, of young and old were left to wander, unwept
2312	metamorphoses	 There was no space in the burial mounds, and not enough wood for the fires
2313	metamorphoses	"’
"
2314	metamorphoses	Stunned by such a storm of dark events, I said ‘O Jupiter, if they do not lie when they say that you were held in Aegina’s embrace, she, the daughter of Asopus, and if you are not ashamed, mighty father, to have fathered me, give me back my people or bury me too in their tomb
2315	metamorphoses	’ He gave me a flash of lightning as a sign, and thunder followed
2316	metamorphoses	 I said ‘I interpret this to be an omen, and that you give me it as a pledge, and may these accordingly be auspicious tokens of your purpose
2317	metamorphoses	"’
"
2318	metamorphoses	There happened to be an oak-tree nearby, with open spreading branches, seeded from Dodona, and sacred to Jove
2319	metamorphoses	 I noticed a long train of food-gathering ants, carrying vast loads in their tiny mouths, and forging their own way over its corrugated bark
2320	metamorphoses	 Admiring their numbers, I said ‘Best of fathers, give me as many citizens as this and fill the city’s empty walls
2321	metamorphoses	’ The tall oak-tree quivered, and its branches filled with sound, without a wind
2322	metamorphoses	 I shivered, my limbs quaking with fear, and my hair stood on end
2323	metamorphoses	 Though I kissed the oak-tree and the earth, not acknowledging my hopes, yet I did hope, and cherished my longings in my heart
2324	metamorphoses	 Night fell, and sleep claimed my care-worn body
2325	metamorphoses	The same oak-tree was there before my eyes, with the same branches, and the same insects on its branches, and it shook with a similar motion, and seemed to scatter its column of grain-bearers onto the ground below
2326	metamorphoses	 Suddenly they seemed to grow larger and larger, and raise themselves from the soil, and stand erect, they lost their leanness, many feet, and their black colouration, and their limbs took on human form
2327	metamorphoses	 Sleep vanished
2328	metamorphoses	 Awake again, I dismissed my dream, bemoaning the lack of help from the gods
2329	metamorphoses	 But there was a great murmuring in the palace, and I thought I heard human voices, those I was now unaccustomed to
2330	metamorphoses	 While I suspected that it was an effect of sleep, Telamon came running and throwing open the door, shouted ‘Father, come out and see, something greater than you could hope or believe
2331	metamorphoses	" Come now!’
"
2332	metamorphoses	I went, and saw such men as I had seen in sleep’s imagining, in ranks such as I recognised and knew
2333	metamorphoses	 They approached and saluted me as king
2334	metamorphoses	 I fulfilled my prayer to Jove, and divided the city amongst this new people, along with the lost farmers’ empty fields
2335	metamorphoses	 I called them Myrmidons, a name that did not belie each one’s origin as an ant, μύρμηξ
2336	metamorphoses	 You have seen their bodies: they still retain the habits they had before, a thrifty, hard-working people, tenacious of achievement, and keeping what they achieve
2337	metamorphoses	 These men fresh in years and spirit, will follow you to war, as soon as that favourable east wind that brought you here’ (it was indeed an easterly that had brought him) ‘has swung round to the south
2338	metamorphoses	"’
"
2339	metamorphoses	They filled a long day with this and other talk: the last of the light was given over to feasting, and night to sleep
2340	metamorphoses	 The sun shone gold again, but an east wind was still blowing, and kept the sails from the homeward voyage
2341	metamorphoses	 The sons of Pallas joined Cephalus, their senior, and Cephalus and the princes then went to the king: but the king was still in a deep sleep
2342	metamorphoses	 Phocus, Aeacus’s son, received them at the threshold, since Telamon and his brother were selecting men for the war
2343	metamorphoses	 Phocus led the Athenians into an inner walk, beautiful and secluded, where they sat down together, and noticed that the grandson of Aeolus carried a spear in his hand, tipped with gold, and made of an unknown wood
2344	metamorphoses	 In the midst of their first short conversation, he said ‘I am knowledgeable about woodland, and hunting wild animals, but I have been wondering for a while what tree that shaft was cut from
2345	metamorphoses	 If it were ash it would be deep yellow, and if it were cornelian cherry it would be knotted
2346	metamorphoses	 What it is I am ignorant of, but my eyes have never seen one more beautifully formed for throwing
2347	metamorphoses	’ One of the Athenian brothers replied ‘You will marvel at its usefulness more than at its looks
2348	metamorphoses	 It hits whatever it is aimed at: there is no chance involved, and then it flies back, bloodied, without needing to be retrieved
2349	metamorphoses	’ Then truly the son of the Nereid wanted to know everything: why this was so, where it came from, and who gave such a wondrous gift
2350	metamorphoses	 What he wanted to know, Cephalus told him, but was still ashamed to say what a high price it had cost him
2351	metamorphoses	 He was silent, and touched with sadness for his lost wife, tears welling in his eyes, he uttered these words
2352	metamorphoses	‘Son of the goddess, this weapon makes me weep (who would believe that?) and it will for many years if the fates grant me them
2353	metamorphoses	 This weapon did for my dear wife and me
2354	metamorphoses	 I wish that I had always been without it! She was Procris, or if Orithyia’s name has chanced to fill your ears more loudly, the sister of that Orithyia whom Boreas stole, though if you were to compare the two in looks and manner, Procris was more worth stealing! Her father Erechtheus brought us together in marriage, and love brought us together too
2355	metamorphoses	 I was called happy, and I was
2356	metamorphoses	 But the gods’ vision of the future was otherwise, or perhaps things would still be so
2357	metamorphoses	The second month after our marriage, I was setting out nets to trap antlered deer, when golden Aurora, chasing away the shadows, saw me from the summit of Mount Hymettus, that is always bright with flowers, and took me away against my will
2358	metamorphoses	 By the grace of the goddess I can repeat the truth: though her face has the blush of roses, though she keeps the borderland of light and night, though she drinks the dewy nectar, I was in love with Procris
2359	metamorphoses	 Procris was in my heart: Procris was always on my lips
2360	metamorphoses	 I kept talking about the sacred marriage bed, and the newness of our union, the recent wedding, and the prior claim of our deserted couch
2361	metamorphoses	 The goddess was angered and said “Stop complaining, ungrateful man: have your Procris! But if my vision is far-sighted, you will wish you had never had her
2362	metamorphoses	” In a fury, she sent me back to her
2363	metamorphoses	As I was returning, reconsidering the goddess’s words, I began to fear lest my wife had not been faithful to our marriage vows
2364	metamorphoses	 Her youth and beauty prompted thoughts of adultery, but her character forbade those thoughts
2365	metamorphoses	 But I had been away a while, and she from whom I was returning was herself an example of the fault, and lovers fear the worst
2366	metamorphoses	 I decided to try what might grieve me, testing her chaste loyalty with gifts
2367	metamorphoses	 Aurora supported my fears, and she changed my appearance (I felt it happening)
2368	metamorphoses	Unrecognisable, I went back to Athens, city of Pallas, and entered my house
2369	metamorphoses	 The house itself was irreproachable, gave every sign of innocence, and was only anxious for its vanished master
2370	metamorphoses	 With difficulty, by a thousand stratagems, I gained access to Erechtheus’s daughter
2371	metamorphoses	 When I saw her I was rooted to the spot, and almost relinquished my thoughts of testing her loyalty
2372	metamorphoses	 Indeed I could hardly keep from confessing the truth, and hardly keep from kissing her, as I ought
2373	metamorphoses	 She was sad (but no one could be more lovely than her in her sadness)
2374	metamorphoses	 She grieved with longing for the husband who had been snatched away
2375	metamorphoses	 Phocus, she was Beauty, whom Grief itself so befits! Why should I tell how many times her chaste nature repelled my advances? All those many times she said “I hold myself, in trust, for one man only: wherever he is, I keep what I can give, in trust, for that one man
2376	metamorphoses	” For whom, in his senses, was that not a great enough trial of loyalty? But I was not satisfied, and struggled on, wounding myself, until by promising to give a fortune for just one night with her, and then increasing the offer, I forced her to hesitate
2377	metamorphoses	" Wrongly victorious, I cried out “I am no adulterer, wicked one! I am your true husband! You have me for a witness, you traitress!”
"
2378	metamorphoses	She said not a word
2379	metamorphoses	 Silent with overwhelming shame, she fled from the treacherous threshold, and her evil husband
2380	metamorphoses	 Deeply hurt by me, and hating the whole race of men, she wandered the mountains, following the ways of Diana
2381	metamorphoses	 Then, deserted, a more violent flame burned in my bones
2382	metamorphoses	 I begged her forgiveness, and confessed I had sinned, and that I too might have succumbed to the same fault, given the offer, if such gifts were offered to me
2383	metamorphoses	 When I had owned to this, and after she had first taken revenge for her wounded honour, she returned to me, and we lived out sweet years in harmony
2384	metamorphoses	 Moreover, as though she in yielding herself gave only a small prize, she gave me a hound as a gift, that her own goddess Cynthia had entrusted to her, saying “he will surpass all other dogs for speed
2385	metamorphoses	” She gave me a spear, likewise, the one, you see, I have in my hands
2386	metamorphoses	" Do you want to know the fate of the other gift? Listen to something marvellous: you will be stirred by the strangeness of the thing!’
"
2387	metamorphoses	‘Oedipus, son of Laïus, had solved with his genius the riddles whose meaning was previously not understood, and the Sphinx, dark prophetess, had hurtled headlong from the cliff, her enigmatic words forgotten
2388	metamorphoses	 Immediately Aonian Thebes was plagued again (since righteous Themis does not leave such things unpunished!) and many country people feared that the Teumessian vixen would destroy their flocks and themselves
2389	metamorphoses	 The young men of the neighbourhood came, and we beat over the wide fields
2390	metamorphoses	 That swift creature leapt lightly over the nets, and cleared the tops of the traps we had set
2391	metamorphoses	 Then we slipped our hounds from the tether, but she escaped their pursuit, and, travelling no slower than a bird flies, mocked the pack
2392	metamorphoses	 With one great shout the hunters called on me to loose Laelaps, ‘Hurricane’ (the name of my wife’s gift)
2393	metamorphoses	 He had long been struggling to free himself from his leash, and straining his neck against the restraint
2394	metamorphoses	 He had scarcely been released properly before we lost sight of him
2395	metamorphoses	The hot dust showed the print of his paws, but he had vanished from sight
2396	metamorphoses	 No javelin was quicker than him, no lead shot from a whirled sling, no light arrow shot from a Cretan bow
2397	metamorphoses	 There was an intervening hill whose summit overlooked the surrounding fields
2398	metamorphoses	 I climbed it, and watched the spectacle of this strange race, where the quarry seemed to be caught, and then to escape its fate
2399	metamorphoses	 Nor does the cunning animal run in a straight course in the open, but it eludes the pursuing muzzle and swings back in a circle, so its enemy cannot charge
2400	metamorphoses	 The hound presses hard, and matches its pace, seems to grip it, and does not grip it, and worries at the air with its empty snapping
2401	metamorphoses	I turned to my spear for help
2402	metamorphoses	 While I was balancing it in my right hand, while I was trying to fit my fingers into the throwing strap, I turned my eyes away
2403	metamorphoses	 When I turned them back to the same place, I saw (a marvel) two shapes of marble in the middle of the plain
2404	metamorphoses	 One you would think to be fleeing, the other pursuing
2405	metamorphoses	 Assuredly, if a god was with them, that god must have willed that both should be unconquered in the race,’ He got so far in his story, and was silent
2406	metamorphoses	 ‘What crime has the spear committed?’ said Phocus
2407	metamorphoses	 And Cephalus recounted its crime
2408	metamorphoses	‘Phocus, my happiness was the beginning of my sorrow, and I will speak of happiness first
2409	metamorphoses	 Son of Aeacus, what a joy it is to remember that blessed time, when, in those early years, I was delighted, and rightly so, with my wife, and she was delighted with her husband
2410	metamorphoses	 We two had mutual cares, and a shared love
2411	metamorphoses	 She would not have preferred Jupiter’s bed to my love, and no woman could have captured me, not if Venus herself had come there
2412	metamorphoses	 An equal flame burnt in our hearts
2413	metamorphoses	" 
"
2414	metamorphoses	Just after dawn, when the first rays struck the hilltops, full of youthfulness, I used to go hunting in the woods
2415	metamorphoses	 I used to take no servants, or horses, or keen-scented hounds, or knotted snares
2416	metamorphoses	 I trusted in my spear
2417	metamorphoses	 But when my right hand was sated with the slaughter of wild creatures, I would return to the cool of the shade, and the breeze, aura, out of the chill valleys
2418	metamorphoses	 I courted the breeze, gentle to me, in the midst of the heat: I waited for aura: she was rest for my labour
2419	metamorphoses	 “Aura” (Indeed, I remember) I used to call “Come to me, delight me, enter my breast, most pleasing one, and, as you do, be willing to ease this heat I burn with!” Perhaps I did add more endearments (so my fate led me on)
2420	metamorphoses	 “You are my greatest pleasure” I used to say
2421	metamorphoses	 “You revive me, and cherish me
2422	metamorphoses	 You make me love the woods and lonely places
2423	metamorphoses	 It is always your breath I try to catch with my lips
2424	metamorphoses	"”
"
2425	metamorphoses	Someone, I don’t know who, hearing the ambiguous words, represented my speech as a betrayal, and thought the word aura I called so often, was the name of a nymph, a nymph he believed I loved
2426	metamorphoses	 Immediately the unthinking witness went to Procris with the tale of my imagined disloyalty, and whispered what he had heard
2427	metamorphoses	 Love is a credulous thing
2428	metamorphoses	 Overcome with sudden pain, they tell me that she fainted
2429	metamorphoses	 After a long time she revived, weeping for herself, calling her fate evil
2430	metamorphoses	 She complained of my faithlessness, and troubled by an imaginary crime, she feared what was nothing, feared a name without substance, and grieved, the unhappy woman, as though aura were a real rival
2431	metamorphoses	Yet she often doubted, and hoped, in her misery, that she was wrong, declaring she would not believe it, and unless she witnessed it herself, would not condemn her husband as guilty of any crime
2432	metamorphoses	 Next morning, when Dawn’s light had dispelled the night I left to seek the woods, and, victorious from the hunt, lying on the grass, I said “Aura, come and relieve my suffering!” and suddenly, amongst my words, I thought I heard someone’s moan
2433	metamorphoses	 “Come, dearest!” I still said, and as the fallen leaves made a rustling sound in reply, I thought it was a wild creature, and threw my spear quickly
2434	metamorphoses	 It was Procris
2435	metamorphoses	" Clasping the wound in her breast she cried out “Ah, me!”
"
2436	metamorphoses	Recognising it as the voice of my faithful wife, I ran headlong and frantic towards that voice
2437	metamorphoses	 I found her half-alive, her clothes sprinkled with drops of blood, and (what misery!) trying to pull this spear, her gift to me, from the wound
2438	metamorphoses	 I lifted her body, dearer to me than my own, with gentle arms, tore the fabric from her breast, and bound up the cruel wound, trying to stem the blood, begging her not to leave me, guilty of her death
2439	metamorphoses	 Though her strength was failing, and even though she was dying, she forced herself to speak a little
2440	metamorphoses	 “By the bed we swore to share, by the gods that I entreat, those that are above, and those that are of my house, by any good I have deserved of you, and by the abiding love, that still, while I die, remains, that is itself the cause of my death, do not allow this Aura to marry you in my place!” She spoke, and then I knew at last the error of the name, and told her
2441	metamorphoses	 But what was the use of telling? She wavered, and the little strength she had ebbed away with her blood
2442	metamorphoses	 While she could still gaze at anything, she gazed at me; and to me, and on my lips, breathed out her unfortunate spirit
2443	metamorphoses	 And her look seemed easier then, untroubled by death
2444	metamorphoses	"’
"
2445	metamorphoses	The hero, weeping, had told this sorrowful tale, when, behold, Aeacus entered with his two sons, and their newly enlisted men, whom Cephalus then accepted, with all their heavy armour
2446	metamorphoses	Now Lucifer dispelling night, and unveiling shining day, the east wind dropped, and rain clouds gathered
2447	metamorphoses	 The mild south wind, gave Cephalus and the Aeacides safe return, bringing them, more quickly than they expected, to the harbour they steered for, by its favourable action
2448	metamorphoses	 Meanwhile Minos was laying waste the coast of Megara, and testing his military strength against the city of Alcathoüs, where Nisus ruled, who had a bright lock of purple hair, on the crown of his head, amongst his distinguished grey tresses, that guaranteed the safety of his kingdom
2449	metamorphoses	The horns of a new moon had risen six times and the fortunes of war still hung in the balance, so protractedly did Victory hover between the two, on hesitant wings
2450	metamorphoses	 There was a tower of the king, added to walls of singing stone, where Apollo, Latona’s son, once rested his golden lyre, and the sound resonated in the rock
2451	metamorphoses	 In days of peace, Scylla, the daughter of King Nisus, often used to climb up there, and make the stones ring using small pebbles
2452	metamorphoses	 In wartime also she would often watch the unyielding armed conflicts from there, and now, as the war dragged on, she had come to know the names of the hostile princes, their weapons, horses, armour and Cretan quivers
2453	metamorphoses	 Above all she came to know the face of their leader, Europa’s son, more than was fitting
2454	metamorphoses	If he covered his head with a plumed helmet, she thought him handsome in a helmet
2455	metamorphoses	 If he carried his shining bronze shield, a shield became him well
2456	metamorphoses	 When he hurled his heavy spear, with taut limbs, the girl admired his strength combined with skill
2457	metamorphoses	 When he bent the broad arc of his bow, with a flight notched in it, she swore that it was Phoebus Apollo, standing there, with his arrow ready
2458	metamorphoses	 But when he exposed his face, free of the bronze, and when, clothed in purple, he took to horseback, his white horse conspicuous with its embroidered trappings, and he controlled its foaming bit, Nisus’s daughter was scarcely in control of herself, scarcely in a rational frame of mind
2459	metamorphoses	 Happy the spear he held, she said, and happy the reins he lifted in his hand
2460	metamorphoses	 Her impulse was to run, though only a girl, if it had been allowed, through the enemy lines; her impulse was to throw herself from the top of the tower into the Cretan camp, to open the bronze gates to their army, or anything else Minos might wish
2461	metamorphoses	As she sat gazing at the white tents of the Dictaean king, she said ‘I am not sure whether I should show joy or grief at this miserable war
2462	metamorphoses	 I grieve because Minos is the enemy of one who loves him, but if there had been no war, he would never have been known to me! If he accepted me as a hostage he could abandon the war: he would have me as his companion, me as a pledge of peace
2463	metamorphoses	 If she, who gave birth to you, most handsome of kings, was as beautiful as you are, no wonder the god was on fire for her
2464	metamorphoses	 O I would be three times happy if I could take wing, through the air, and stand in the camp of the Cretan king, and reveal myself, and my love, and ask what dowry he would need to win me: so long as he does not demand my country’s stronghold! Rather let my hopes of marriage die, than that I be capable of betrayal! - Though often many have found it better to be defeated, if a peace-loving conqueror showed clemency
2465	metamorphoses	 Indeed he wages a just war because of his murdered son: his cause is powerful, and the arms that support his cause
2466	metamorphoses	 Then, I think we will be conquered
2467	metamorphoses	" And if that is the end that awaits the city, why should his strength breach these walls of mine, rather than my love?
"
2468	metamorphoses	It would be better for him to win, without slaughter, or delay, and without the shedding of his own blood
2469	metamorphoses	 At least I would not be afraid lest someone inadvertently wound your breast, Minos: for who would be so cruel as to venture to aim his throw at you, unless he was careless? The idea pleases me, and I am firm in my decision to deliver myself to you, with my country as my dowry, and so put an end to war
2470	metamorphoses	 But, it is not enough merely to want it! There is a guard watching the entrance, and my father holds the keys of the gate
2471	metamorphoses	 I only fear through him I might be unlucky: only he hinders my wishes
2472	metamorphoses	 Would that the gods had devised things so that I had no father! Surely everyone is their own god: Fortune rejects idle wishes
2473	metamorphoses	 Another girl, fired with as great a passion as mine, would, long ago, have destroyed anything that stood in the way of her love
2474	metamorphoses	 And why should another be braver than I am? I would dare to go through fire and sword: but there is no need here to brave fire or sword: I need one lock of my father’s hair
2475	metamorphoses	 That is more precious than gold to me, that purple lock of hair will bless me, and let me achieve my desire
2476	metamorphoses	"’
"
2477	metamorphoses	As she was speaking, Night, most powerful healer of our cares, darkened, and, with the shadows, her boldness grew
2478	metamorphoses	 The first hours of quiet had come, when sleep soothes hearts that the day’s anxieties have wearied: the daughter steals silently into her father’s room, and (alas, the evil!) robs him of the fateful lock of hair
2479	metamorphoses	 Through the middle of the enemy camp she goes (so certain of her worth to them) with the impious prize she has gained, straight to the king: who is startled by her speech to him
2480	metamorphoses	 ‘Love drove me to crime! I, Scylla, daughter of King Nisus, deliver, to you, the gods of my house, and my country
2481	metamorphoses	 I ask no gift but yourself
2482	metamorphoses	 Take this purple lock of hair as the pledge of my love, and know that I do not deliver merely a lock of his hair to you, but his head!’ And she held out her gift in her sinful hand
2483	metamorphoses	 Minos recoiled from what she offered him, and shaken by the thought of this unnatural act, answered ‘May the gods banish you from their world, O you who disgrace this age, and may land and sea be denied you! Be certain I will never allow Crete, which is my world, and the cradle of Jove, to give sanctuary to such a monstrous child
2484	metamorphoses	"’
"
2485	metamorphoses	He spoke: and after establishing laws for his defeated enemies, this most just of legislators, ordered the cables to be loosed from his fleet, and the oars of the bronze-beaked ships to be set in motion
2486	metamorphoses	 When Scylla saw that the ships were drawing away over the sea, and that their master had refused her the reward for her wickedness, exhausting prayer, she succumbed to violent anger, and, her hair streaming, shouted in her fury, stretching our her hands
2487	metamorphoses	 ‘Where are you running to, deserting the creator of your success, O you whom I have set above my father, set above my country? Where are you running to, cruel one, whose victory was my crime, and my kindness? Does neither the gift I gave, nor my love, move you, nor the knowledge that all my hopes are contained in you alone? Where shall I go, deserted like this? To my country? It is defeated! Even if it were not, it is closed to me through my treachery! To my father’s presence? Whom I betrayed to you? The citizens hate me, with reason, and their neighbours fear my example
2488	metamorphoses	 I am exposed to the world, so that Crete alone might be open to me
2489	metamorphoses	 If you deny me Crete, also, and leave me here, in your ingratitude, your mother was not Europa, but the sandbanks of hostile Syrtis, or the Armenian tigress, or Charybdis’s whirlpool, stirred by the south wind
2490	metamorphoses	 Nor are you Jupiter’s son, nor was your mother deceived by the image of a bull
2491	metamorphoses	 That tale of your birth is a lie! Truly a bull begot you: a wild one, never captive of a heifer’s love
2492	metamorphoses	Nisus, father, punish me! Joy in my pain, walls, that I have betrayed! Now, I confess it, I deserve to be hated, and to die
2493	metamorphoses	 But let one of those whom I have impiously wounded destroy me! Why should you attack me for my crime, who gained victory through that crime? My sin against my father, and my country, was a kindness to you! Pasiphaë is truly a fit mate for you: that adulteress who fooled the fierce bull with that wooden frame, and carried a hybrid foetus in her womb
2494	metamorphoses	 Does my speech penetrate your ears, monster of ingratitude, or do the same winds that blow your ships on, blow my words away to nothingness? Now, Now, it is no wonder to me, that Pasiphaë preferred that bull to you: you have more savagery in you than he had
2495	metamorphoses	 Oh, he is ordering them to run! And the waves resound to the beat of the oars, and I and my land recede
2496	metamorphoses	 No matter
2497	metamorphoses	 Oh, in vain, you forget my kindnesses: I shall follow you against your will, clinging to the curved sternpost, dragged over the wide ocean
2498	metamorphoses	"’
"
2499	metamorphoses	She had scarcely finished speaking when she leapt into the sea, and swam after the fleet, her passion lending her strength, and clung to the Cretan boat
2500	metamorphoses	 Her father, who had been newly changed into a sea eagle, soaring through the air on tawny wings, saw her, and dived towards her, as she clung there, to tear at her with his hooked beak
2501	metamorphoses	 In fear she let go of the sternpost, but as she fell the light breeze seemed to hold her, not letting her touch the water
2502	metamorphoses	 Feathers spring from her arms: changed into a bird, the rock dove, with its red legs and purple throat, she is called Ciris, ‘Cutter’, and acquired that name from her cutting of the lock of hair
2503	metamorphoses	When Minos reached Cretan soil he paid his dues to Jove, with the sacrifice of a hundred bulls, and hung up his war trophies to adorn the palace
2504	metamorphoses	 The scandal concerning his family grew, and the queen’s unnatural adultery was evident from the birth of a strange hybrid monster
2505	metamorphoses	 Minos resolved to remove this shame, the Minotaur, from his house, and hide it away in a labyrinth with blind passageways
2506	metamorphoses	 Daedalus, celebrated for his skill in architecture, laid out the design, and confused the clues to direction, and led the eye into a tortuous maze, by the windings of alternating paths
2507	metamorphoses	 No differently from the way in which the watery Maeander deludes the sight, flowing backwards and forwards in its changeable course, through the meadows of Phrygia, facing the running waves advancing to meet it, now directing its uncertain waters towards its source, now towards the open sea: so Daedalus made the endless pathways of the maze, and was scarcely able to recover the entrance himself: the building was as deceptive as that
2508	metamorphoses	In there, Minos walled up the twin form of bull and man, and twice nourished it on Athenian blood, but the third repetition of the nine-year tribute by lot, caused the monster’s downfall
2509	metamorphoses	 When, through the help of the virgin princess, Ariadne, by rewinding the thread, Theseus, son of Aegeus, won his way back to the elusive threshold, that no one had previously regained, he immediately set sail for Dia, stealing the daughter of Minos away with him, then cruelly abandoned his companion on that shore
2510	metamorphoses	 Deserted and weeping bitterly, as she was, Bacchus-Liber brought her help and comfort
2511	metamorphoses	 So that she might shine among the eternal stars, he took the crown from her forehead, and set it in the sky
2512	metamorphoses	 It soared through the rarefied air, and as it soared its jewels changed to bright fires, and took their place, retaining the appearance of a crown, as the Corona Borealis, between the kneeling Hercules and the head of the serpent that Ophiuchus holds
2513	metamorphoses	Meanwhile Daedalus, hating Crete, and his long exile, and filled with a desire to stand on his native soil, was imprisoned by the waves
2514	metamorphoses	 ‘He may thwart our escape by land or sea’ he said ‘but the sky is surely open to us: we will go that way: Minos rules everything but he does not rule the heavens’
2515	metamorphoses	 So saying he applied his thought to new invention and altered the natural order of things
2516	metamorphoses	 He laid down lines of feathers, beginning with the smallest, following shorter with longer ones, so you might think they had grown like that, on a slant
2517	metamorphoses	 In this way, long ago, the rustic pan-pipes were graduated, with lengthening reeds
2518	metamorphoses	 Then he fastened them together with thread at the middle, and bees’-wax at the base, and, when he had arranged them, he flexed each one into a gentle curve, so that they imitated real bird’s wings
2519	metamorphoses	 His son, Icarus, stood next to him, and, not realising that he was handling things that would endanger him, caught laughingly at the down that blew in the passing breeze, and softened the yellow bees’-wax with his thumb, and, in his play, hindered his father’s marvellous work
2520	metamorphoses	When he had put the last touches to what he had begun, the artificer balanced his own body between the two wings and hovered in the moving air
2521	metamorphoses	 He instructed the boy as well, saying ‘Let me warn you, Icarus, to take the middle way, in case the moisture weighs down your wings, if you fly too low, or if you go too high, the sun scorches them
2522	metamorphoses	 Travel between the extremes
2523	metamorphoses	 And I order you not to aim towards Bootes, the Herdsman, or Helice, the Great Bear, or towards the drawn sword of Orion: take the course I show you!’ At the same time as he laid down the rules of flight, he fitted the newly created wings on the boy’s shoulders
2524	metamorphoses	 While he worked and issued his warnings the ageing man’s cheeks were wet with tears: the father’s hands trembled
2525	metamorphoses	He gave a never to be repeated kiss to his son, and lifting upwards on his wings, flew ahead, anxious for his companion, like a bird, leading her fledglings out of a nest above, into the empty air
2526	metamorphoses	 He urged the boy to follow, and showed him the dangerous art of flying, moving his own wings, and then looking back at his son
2527	metamorphoses	 Some angler catching fish with a quivering rod, or a shepherd leaning on his crook, or a ploughman resting on the handles of his plough, saw them, perhaps, and stood there amazed, believing them to be gods able to travel the sky
2528	metamorphoses	And now Samos, sacred to Juno, lay ahead to the left (Delos and Paros were behind them), Lebinthos, and Calymne, rich in honey, to the right, when the boy began to delight in his daring flight, and abandoning his guide, drawn by desire for the heavens, soared higher
2529	metamorphoses	 His nearness to the devouring sun softened the fragrant wax that held the wings: and the wax melted: he flailed with bare arms, but losing his oar-like wings, could not ride the air
2530	metamorphoses	 Even as his mouth was crying his father’s name, it vanished into the dark blue sea, the Icarian Sea, called after him
2531	metamorphoses	 The unhappy father, now no longer a father, shouted ‘Icarus, Icarus where are you? Which way should I look, to see you?’ ‘Icarus’ he called again
2532	metamorphoses	 Then he caught sight of the feathers on the waves, and cursed his inventions
2533	metamorphoses	 He laid the body to rest, in a tomb, and the island was named Icaria after his buried child
2534	metamorphoses	As he was consigning his unfortunate son to the grave, a noisy partridge poked its head out from a muddy ditch, and, called, cackling joyfully, with whirring wings
2535	metamorphoses	 It was the only one of its kind, not seen in previous years, and only recently made a bird, as a lasting reproach to you, Daedalus
2536	metamorphoses	 Your sister, Perdix, oblivious to the fates, sent you her son, Talus, to be taught: twelve years old, his mind ready for knowledge
2537	metamorphoses	 Indeed, the child, studying the spine of a fish, took it as a model, and cut continuous teeth out of sharp metal, inventing the use of the saw
2538	metamorphoses	 He was also the first to pivot two iron arms on a pin, so that, with the arms at a set distance, one part could be fixed, and the other sweep out a circle
2539	metamorphoses	 Daedalus was jealous, and hurled the boy headlong from Minerva’s sacred citadel, claiming that he had fallen
2540	metamorphoses	 But Pallas Minerva, who favours those with quick minds, caught him, and turned him into the partridge, masking him with feathers in mid-air
2541	metamorphoses	 His inborn energy was transferred to swift wings and feet, and he kept his mother’s name, Perdix, from before
2542	metamorphoses	 But the bird does not perch above the ground, and does not make its nest on branches or on high points, but flies low on whirring wings over the soil, and lays its eggs in a sheltered place
2543	metamorphoses	Now Sicily, the land of Mount Etna, held the weary Daedalus, and King Cocalus, regarded as peaceable, had taken up arms, against Minos, in defence of the suppliant: and thanks to Theseus, Athens now had ceased to pay Crete the sorrowful levy
2544	metamorphoses	 The temple was wreathed with flowers, and the Athenians called out to warlike Minerva, to Jupiter and to the other gods, honouring them with gifts, and the blood of sacrificial offerings, and the contents of their incense-boxes
2545	metamorphoses	 Far-wandering fame had spread the name of Theseus through all the cities of the Argolis, and the peoples inhabiting wealthy Achaia begged for his help in their great trouble, and Calydon, as a suppliant, despite having Meleager, asked his help, with anxious prayers
2546	metamorphoses	The reason for their asking was a wild boar, servant and avenging power of Diana’s aggression
2547	metamorphoses	 King Oeneus of Calydon, they say, made offerings, from the successful harvests of a full year, of the first fruits of the crops to Ceres, of wine to Bacchus, ‘the deliverer from care’, of libations of flowing oil, from the olives, to golden Minerva
2548	metamorphoses	 The honour they desire was paid to all the gods, beginning with the rural deities: only the daughter of Latona’s altar was passed by: neglected, it is said, and left without its incense
2549	metamorphoses	 Anger even touches the gods
2550	metamorphoses	 ‘I shall not suffer this without exacting punishment’ she cried ‘and, though not honoured, it will not be said that I was un-avenged
2551	metamorphoses	’ And the goddess, spurned, sent an avenging wild boar, over the Aetolian fields: grassy Epirus had none greater than it, and those of the island of Sicily were smaller
2552	metamorphoses	 Its eyes glowed with bloodshot fire: its neck was stiff with bristles, and the hairs, on its hide, bristled stiffly like spear-shafts: just as a palisade stands, so the hairs stood like tall spears
2553	metamorphoses	 Hot foam flecked the broad shoulders, from its hoarse grunting
2554	metamorphoses	 Its tusks were the size of an Indian elephant’s: lightning came from its mouth: and the leaves were scorched, by its breath
2555	metamorphoses	 Now it trampled the young shoots of the growing crops, now cut short the ripeness, longed-for by the mournful farmer, and scythed down the corn in ear
2556	metamorphoses	 The granaries and threshing floors waited for the promised harvest in vain
2557	metamorphoses	 Heavy clusters of grapes were brought down along with the trailing vines, and fruit and branch of the evergreen olives
2558	metamorphoses	 It rages among the cattle too
2559	metamorphoses	 Neither the herdsmen and dogs, nor their own fierce bulls can defend the herds
2560	metamorphoses	 The people scatter, and only count themselves safe behind city walls
2561	metamorphoses	At last Meleager and a handpicked group of men gather, longing for glory: Castor and Polydeuces, the Dioscuri, twin sons of Tyndareus and Leda, one son famous for boxing, the other for horsemanship: Jason who built the first ship: Theseus and Pirithoüs, fortunate in friendship: Plexippus and Toxeus, the two sons of Thestius, uncles of Meleager: Lynceus and swift Idas, sons of Aphareus: Caeneus, once a woman: warlike Leucippus: Acastus, famed for his javelin: Hippothoüs: Dryas: Phoenix, Amyntor’s son: Eurytus and Cleatus, the sons of Actor: and Phyleus, sent by Elis
2562	metamorphoses	Telamon was there, and Peleus, father of the great Achilles: with Admetus, the son of Pheres, and Iolaüs from Boeotia were Eurytion, energetic in action, and Echion unbeaten at running: and Lelex from Locria, Panopeus, Hyleus, and daring Hippasus: Nestor, still in the prime of life: and those that Hippocoön sent, with Enaesimus, from ancient Amyclae: Laërtes, Penelope’s father-in-law with Ancaeus of Arcady: Mopsus, the shrewd son of Ampyx: and Amphiaraüs, son of Oecleus, not yet betrayed by his wife, Eriphyle
2563	metamorphoses	And Atalanta, the warrior girl of Tegea, the glory of Arcadia’s woods, with a polished brooch clasping the neck of her garment, and her hair simply done, caught in a single knot
2564	metamorphoses	 An ivory quiver, holding her arrows, that rattled as she moved, hung from her left shoulder, and her left hand held the bow
2565	metamorphoses	 So she was dressed: as for her face, you might truly say, the virgin was there, in a boy, and a boy, in the girl
2566	metamorphoses	 The moment he saw her, that moment, Meleager, the hero of Calydon, desired her, though the gods might refuse it, devoured by secret fires
2567	metamorphoses	 ‘O, happy the man, whom she might think worthy!’ he said
2568	metamorphoses	 Neither time nor honour allowed him further words: the greater task of the greater conflict urged him on
2569	metamorphoses	A forest thick with trees, that had never been cut, at any time, began above the plain, and overlooked the sloping fields
2570	metamorphoses	 When the heroes reached it, some spread out hunting nets, others loosed the dogs from their leashes, while others again followed the deeply-marked trail, keen to discover their quarry
2571	metamorphoses	 There was a deep valley that collected streams of rainwater, falling near it: and it held, in its depths, pliant willows, smooth sedges, and marsh grasses, and osiers and tall bulrushes, above the lowly reeds
2572	metamorphoses	 The boar was roused from there, and made a violent charge into the midst of its enemies, like lightning forced from colliding clouds
2573	metamorphoses	 Trees were flattened by its impact, and the woods crashed as it drove into them
2574	metamorphoses	 The warriors shouted, and held their spears spread outward, with firm hands, waving their broad blades
2575	metamorphoses	 The boar rushed them, scattering the dogs, as they obstructed it in its fury, putting the baying pack to flight with sidelong swipes of its tusks
2576	metamorphoses	 The first spear, delivered by Echion’s arm, was ineffectual, and gave the trunk of a maple a glancing blow
2577	metamorphoses	 The next, if it had not been thrown with too great a force, aimed at the creature’s back, seemed certain to stick there, but the throw was too long
2578	metamorphoses	 Jason of Pagasae hurled the spear
2579	metamorphoses	Then Mopsus, son of Ampyx, cried out ‘Phoebus, if I have worshipped you, and do so now, grant what I ask, that my spear strikes surely!’ The god did what he could, to fulfil the prayer: the boar was hit, but without being wounded
2580	metamorphoses	 Diana had stolen the iron point of the javelin, in flight: what arrived was the wooden shaft without its tip
2581	metamorphoses	 The wild beast’s anger was aroused, and blazed out no more gently than lightning
2582	metamorphoses	 Flame burned in its eyes, and was breathed from its chest
2583	metamorphoses	 With dangerous and unerring momentum, the boar hurtled towards the young men, as a stone flies from a taut catapult, aimed at walls or battlements full of soldiers
2584	metamorphoses	 Hippalmus and Pelagon, holding the right flank, were knocked to the ground: their friends caught them up as they lay there
2585	metamorphoses	 But Enaesimus, son of Hippocoön, did not escape the fatal blow: about to turn his back, in alarm, he sank down, as the sinews of his knee gave way
2586	metamorphoses	 And King Nestor of Pylos, might perhaps have perished before his time at Troy, but, using the leverage of his firmly planted spear, he vaulted into a tree, that stood close by, and looked down, from a place of safety, on the quarry he had escaped
2587	metamorphoses	The fierce creature, sharpening its tusks on the trunk of an oak, threatened them with destruction, and confident in its freshly renewed weapons, ripped open mighty Hippasus’s thigh, with one curving edge
2588	metamorphoses	 But now the Gemini, Castor and Pollux, not yet changed into stars in the sky, twin brothers, conspicuous among the rest, both rode up, on horses whiter than snow, and brandishing their javelins in the air as one, hurled them, the points quivering with the motion
2589	metamorphoses	They would have wounded the beast, had not the bristling creature retreated into the dense woods where no horse or spear could penetrate
2590	metamorphoses	 Telamon did follow, and careless where he was placing his feet, in his enthusiasm, fell flat on the ground, tripping over the root of a tree
2591	metamorphoses	 While Peleus was lifting him, the girl from Tegea strung a swift arrow, and sent it speeding from the curved bow
2592	metamorphoses	 The shaft just grazed the top of the boar’s back, and fixing itself below one ear, reddened the bristles with a thin stream of blood
2593	metamorphoses	 Nor did she praise her own successful shot more than Meleager did
2594	metamorphoses	 He was supposed to have been the first to see the blood, and first, having seen it, to point it out to his friends, saying: ‘You will be honoured for the value of this service
2595	metamorphoses	’ The warriors flushed with their shame, urged each other on, gaining courage from their clamour, hurling their spears without sense of order
2596	metamorphoses	 The jostling spoilt their throw, and prevented the strike they intended
2597	metamorphoses	 Then Ancaeus of Arcady, with his twin-headed axe, rushing to meet his fate, cried: ‘O warriors, learn how much better a man’s weapons are than a girl’s, and leave the work to me! Though Latona’s daughter herself protects this creature, in her own way, in spite of Diana, my right arm will destroy it
2598	metamorphoses	’ Swollen with pride, like this, with boastful words, he spoke, and, lifting the double axe in both hands, he stood on tiptoe, poised for the downward blow
2599	metamorphoses	 The boar anticipated this daring enemy, and struck at the upper groin, the quickest way to kill, with his twin tusks
2600	metamorphoses	 Ancaeus collapsed, and the slippery mass of his inner organs fell away in a pool of blood: the ground was soaked with the red fluid
2601	metamorphoses	Then Pirithoüs, son of Ixion, went against the quarry, brandishing his hunting-spear in his strong right-hand
2602	metamorphoses	 Theseus, Aegeus’s son, called out ‘Stay, farther away, my soul’s other half, O dearer to me than myself! It is fine to be brave at a distance, also: Ancaeus’s rash courage only did him harm
2603	metamorphoses	’ He spoke, and threw his heavy spear, of cornelian cherry-wood, with its bronze blade
2604	metamorphoses	 Though well aimed and capable of reaching its mark, it was deflected by the leafy branch of an oak
2605	metamorphoses	 Jason, Aeson’s son, hurled his javelin, which swerved by accident, and the fatal throw transfixing the flanks of an innocent hound, pinned it to the ground
2606	metamorphoses	But Meleager’s hand made the difference, and of the two spears he threw, though one stuck in the earth, the other fixed itself in the boar’s back
2607	metamorphoses	 Now, while it raged, and twisted its body round, and spouted out hissing foam and fresh blood, the author of its wound came at it, pricked his quarry to fury, and buried his shining hunting-spear in his enemy’s shoulder
2608	metamorphoses	 Then the companions give proof of their joy, shouting, and crowding around him to grasp his hand in theirs
2609	metamorphoses	 They gaze, wonderingly, at the huge creature covering so much of the earth it lies on, and still think it unsafe to touch the beast, but nevertheless each wets his spear in its blood
2610	metamorphoses	Meleager, himself, pressed his foot down on the head of the deadly creature, and said to Atalanta ‘Girl from Nonacria, take the prize that is mine by right, and let my glory be shared with you
2611	metamorphoses	’ Then he gave her the spoils, the hide bristling with hair, and the head remarkable for its magnificent tusks
2612	metamorphoses	 She delighted in the giver no less than the gift, but the others were envious, and a murmur ran through the whole company
2613	metamorphoses	 Of these, Plexippus, and Toxeus, the sons of Thestius, Meleager’s uncles, stretching their arms out, shouted loudly: ‘Come on, girl, leave them alone: do not steal our titles to honour, and do not let too much faith in your beauty deceive you, lest your love-sick friend turns out to be no help to you
2614	metamorphoses	’ And they took the gifts away from her, and denied him the right to give them
2615	metamorphoses	 The descendant of Mars could not bear this, and bursting with anger, gnashing his teeth, he said: ‘Learn, you thieves of other men’s rights, the difference between threats and actions’, and plunged his iron point into Plexippus’s chest, he expecting nothing of that kind
2616	metamorphoses	 Meleager gave Toxeus, who stood in doubt, wanting to avenge his brother, but fearing his brother’s fate, scant time for doubt, and while his spear was still warm from the first brother’s murder, he warmed it again with the second brother’s blood
2617	metamorphoses	Althaea was carrying thanksgiving offerings, for her son Meleager’s victory, to the temple of the gods, when she saw them bringing back her dead brothers
2618	metamorphoses	 She filled the city with the clamour of wailing, beat her breasts, and replaced her golden robes with black
2619	metamorphoses	 But when she heard who the murderer was, she forgot her mourning, and her longing changed from tears to revenge
2620	metamorphoses	There was a piece of wood that the Three Sisters placed in the fire, when Althaea, the daughter of Thestius, was in the throes of childbirth
2621	metamorphoses	 As they spun the threads of fate firmly under their thumbs, they said: ‘We assign an equal span of time to you, O new born child, and to this brand
2622	metamorphoses	’ When the goddesses vanished, after speaking the prophecy, the mother snatched the burning branch from the fire, and doused it with water
2623	metamorphoses	 It had long been hidden away in the depths of the inner rooms, and preserved, had preserved your years, youth
2624	metamorphoses	 Your mother now brought it out, and called for pinewood and kindling: and, once that was in position, she lit the hostile flames
2625	metamorphoses	 Then she tried, four times, to throw the brand in the fire, and four times, held back
2626	metamorphoses	 The mother fought the sister in her, and the two tugged at the one heart
2627	metamorphoses	 Often her cheeks grew pale at imminent wickedness
2628	metamorphoses	 Often fierce anger filled her eyes with blood
2629	metamorphoses	 One moment she seemed like someone threatening some cruelty: the next you would think her full of compassion
2630	metamorphoses	 When her heart’s fierce passion dried up her tears, the tears welled up again
2631	metamorphoses	 As a ship, that the wind, and the tide opposing the wind, both seize, feels the twin forces and obeys the two, uncertainly, so the daughter of Thestius, was swayed by her emotions, and her anger alternately calmed, and then flared again
2632	metamorphoses	However, the sister in her begins to outweigh the mother, and to appease the shades of her own blood, with blood, she escapes guilt by incurring it
2633	metamorphoses	 Now, as the baleful fire strengthens, she cries ‘Let this be the funeral pyre that cremates my child
2634	metamorphoses	’ As she held the fatal brand in her deadly hand, and stood, wretched woman, in front of the funeral altars, she said ‘Eumenides, Triple Goddesses of Retribution, turn your faces towards these fearful rites! I take revenge, and I do a wicked thing: death must be atoned for by death: crime must be heaped on crime, ruin on ruin
2635	metamorphoses	 Let this impious house end in a flood of mourning! Shall, Oeneus, fortunate, rejoice in his victorious child, while Thestius is bereaved of his sons? Better for both to grieve
2636	metamorphoses	 Only, my brother’s spirits, new-made ghosts, recognise my sense of duty to you, and accept the sacrifice I prepare, so great its cost to me, the evil child of my womb! Ah me! What conclusion do I rush towards? My brothers, forgive a mother! The hand is unequal to what it began: I acknowledge he deserves to die, but I do not desire to be the cause of his death
2637	metamorphoses	" Shall he go unpunished? Shall he live, victorious, proud of his success, and be king in Calydon, while you lie there, the scant ashes of chill shadows? For my part I cannot suffer that to be: let the wicked die, and pull down his father’s hopes, his kingship, and the ruins of his country! Where are my maternal feelings? Where are the sacred allegiances of a parent? Where are the anxieties I suffered over those ten months? O, I wish, when you were an infant burning in those first flames, I had allowed it to be! By my gift, you lived: now for your own fault, you die! Suffer the consequences of what you have done, and give me back the life I twice gave you, once at your birth, once when I snatched at the brand, or let me join my brothers in the tomb!
"
2638	metamorphoses	I yearn to do it, and I cannot do it
2639	metamorphoses	 What shall I do? Now my brothers’ wounds are before my eyes and the image of all that blood: and now heart’s love, and the word ‘mother’ move me
2640	metamorphoses	 Woe to me! Evil is in your victory, my brothers: but victory you shall have: only let me follow you, and the comfort I bring you!’ She spoke, and turning her face away, with trembling hands, threw the fatal brand, into the midst of the fire
2641	metamorphoses	 The piece of wood itself gave, or seemed to give, a sigh, as it was attacked, and burnt, by the reluctant flames
2642	metamorphoses	Far off, and unaware, Meleager is alight with that fire, and feels his inner organs invisibly seared
2643	metamorphoses	 He controls the fierce agonies, with courage
2644	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless he is sad that he must die a bloodless, cowardly death, and calls Ancaeus fortunate in his wounds
2645	metamorphoses	 At the last, groaning with pain, he names his aged father, his brothers, his loving sisters, the companion of his bed, and, it may be, his mother
2646	metamorphoses	 The fire and the suffering flare up, and die away, again, and both are extinguished together
2647	metamorphoses	 Gradually his breath vanishes into the light breeze: gradually white ashes veil the glowing embers
2648	metamorphoses	Noble Calydon lies dead
2649	metamorphoses	 Young men and old lament, people and princes moan, and the women of Calydon, by the River Euenus, tear at their hair, and beat their breasts
2650	metamorphoses	 His father, prone on the ground, mars his aged features and white hair with dust, and rebukes himself for his long years
2651	metamorphoses	 As for his mother, conscious of her dreadful action, she has exacted punishment on herself, with her own hand driving the weapon into her body
2652	metamorphoses	 Not though the god had given me a hundred mouths speaking with tongues, the necessary genius, and all Helicon as my domain, could I describe the sad fate of his poor sisters
2653	metamorphoses	 Forgetting what is seemly, they strike their bruised chests, and while there is something left of the body, the body is caressed again and again, as they kiss it and kiss the bier on which it lies
2654	metamorphoses	Once he is ashes the ashes are gathered, and they press them to their breasts, throw themselves down on his tomb, and clasping the stone carved with his name, they drown the name with tears
2655	metamorphoses	 At last, Diana, satiated with her destruction of the house of Parthaon, lifted them up, all except Gorge, and Deianira, the daughter-in-law of noble Alcmena, and, making feathers spring from their bodies, and stretching long wings over their arms, she gave them beaks, and, changed to guinea-hens, the Meleagrides, launched them into the air
2656	metamorphoses	Meanwhile, Theseus, having played his part in the united effort, turned back towards Athens, Tritonia’s city, where Erectheus once ruled
2657	metamorphoses	 But the River Acheloüs, swollen with rain, blocked his immediate path, and stalled his journey
2658	metamorphoses	 ‘Come under my roof, famous scion of Cecrops,’ the river-god said, ‘and do not commit yourself to my devouring waters
2659	metamorphoses	 They are liable to carry solid tree-trunks along, in their roaring, and roll great boulders over on their sides
2660	metamorphoses	 I have seen whole byres, near the bank, swept away, with all their livestock: and neither the cattle’s strength nor the horses’ speed was of any use
2661	metamorphoses	 Many a strong man has been lost in the whirling vortices, when the torrent was loosed, after mountain snows
2662	metamorphoses	 You will be safer to stay till my river runs in its normal channel, when its bed holds only a slender stream
2663	metamorphoses	"’
"
2664	metamorphoses	Aegeus’s son nodded, and replied: ‘I will make use of your house, and your counsel, Acheloüs
2665	metamorphoses	’ And so he did
2666	metamorphoses	 He entered the dark building, made of spongy pumice, and rough tufa
2667	metamorphoses	 The floor was moist with soft moss, and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells
2668	metamorphoses	Now Hyperion, the sun, had measured out two thirds of his path of light, when Theseus and his companions of the hunt seated themselves on couches
2669	metamorphoses	 Here was Pirithoüs, Ixion’s son, and there, Lelex, Troezen’s hero, his temples already streaked with thinning grey hair, and there were others whom the Acarnanian river-god, greatly delighted to have such a guest, judged worthy of equal honour
2670	metamorphoses	 Quickly the barefoot nymphs set out dishes of food on the nearby tables, and when they had been cleared again, poured wine in jewelled cups
2671	metamorphoses	 Then the greatest of heroes looking out over the waters below, asked: ‘What is that place?’ (He pointed with his finger
2672	metamorphoses	") ‘Tell me what name the island has, though it seems more than an island!’
"
2673	metamorphoses	The river-god replied ‘What you see is not one island: five pieces of land lie together, but the distance conceals their distinctiveness
2674	metamorphoses	 This will make you less astonished at what Diana did to Calydon when she was slighted
2675	metamorphoses	 Those islands were once nymphs, who, though they had slaughtered ten bullocks and invited the rural gods to the festival, forgot me as they led the festal dance
2676	metamorphoses	 I swelled with anger, as fierce as when my flood is at its fullest, and terrible in wind and wave, I tore forest from forest and field from field, and swept the nymphs, who then, at last, remembered me, along with the place they trod, into the sea
2677	metamorphoses	 There the ocean and my waters separated what had been continuous ground, and split it into as many parts as you see islands, the Echinades, there in the midst of the waves
2678	metamorphoses	But as you can see for yourself, far off, far off one island vanishes, dear to me: the sailors call it Perimele
2679	metamorphoses	 I loved her and stole her virginity
2680	metamorphoses	 At which her father, unable to accept it, threw his daughter from the cliffs into the deep, intending to destroy her
2681	metamorphoses	 I caught her, and holding her as she swam, I cried: ‘O God of the Trident, to whom rule over the restless waves, closest to earth, fell by lot, give your aid I beg, and grant a place to one whom a father’s anger drowns, or allow her to be that place herself!’ While I spoke, new earth clasped her body, as she swam, and a solid island rose, round her changed limbs
2682	metamorphoses	At this, the river-god fell silent
2683	metamorphoses	 The wonder of the thing had gripped them all
2684	metamorphoses	 But that daring spirit, Pirithoüs, son of Ixion, scornful of the gods, laughed at their credulity
2685	metamorphoses	 ‘These are fictions you tell of, Acheloüs, and you credit the gods with too much power, if you think they can give and take away the forms of things
2686	metamorphoses	’ The others were startled, and disapproved of his words, Lelex above all, experienced in mind and years, who said: ‘The power of the gods is great and knows no limit, and whatever heaven decrees comes to pass
2687	metamorphoses	 To help convince you, in the hills of Phrygia, an oak and a lime tree stand side by side, surrounded by a low wall
2688	metamorphoses	 I have seen the place, since Pittheus, king of Troezen, sent me into that country, where his father Pelops once ruled
2689	metamorphoses	There is a swamp not far from there, once habitable land but now the haunt of diving-birds and marsh-loving coots
2690	metamorphoses	 Jupiter went there, disguised as a mortal, and Mercury, the descendant of Atlas, setting aside his wings, went with his father, carrying the caduceus
2691	metamorphoses	 A thousand houses they approached, looking for a place to rest: a thousand houses were locked and bolted
2692	metamorphoses	 But one received them: it was humble it is true, roofed with reeds and stems from the marsh, but godly Baucis and the equally aged Philemon, had been wedded in that cottage in their younger years, and there had grown old together
2693	metamorphoses	 They made light of poverty by acknowledging it, and bearing it without discontent of mind
2694	metamorphoses	 It was no matter if you asked for owner or servant there: those two were the whole household: they gave orders and carried them out equally
2695	metamorphoses	So when the gods from heaven met the humble household gods, and stooping down, passed the low doorway, the old man pulled out a bench, and requested them to rest their limbs, while over the bench Baucis threw a rough blanket
2696	metamorphoses	 Then she raked over the warm ashes in the hearth, and brought yesterday’s fire to life, feeding it with leaves and dried bark, nursing the flames with her aged breath
2697	metamorphoses	 She pulled down finely divided twigs and dry stems from the roof, and, breaking them further, pushed them under a small bronze pot
2698	metamorphoses	 Next she stripped the leaves from vegetables that her husband had gathered from his well-watered garden
2699	metamorphoses	 He used a two-pronged stick to lift down a wretched-looking chine of meat, hanging from a blackened beam, and, cutting a meagre piece from the carefully saved chine, put what had been cut, to seethe, in boiling water
2700	metamorphoses	In the meantime they made conversation to pass the time, and prevent their guests being conscious of the delay
2701	metamorphoses	 There was a beech wood tub, suspended by its handle from a crude peg: this had been filled with warm water, and allowed their visitors to refresh their limbs
2702	metamorphoses	 In the middle of the floor there was a mattress of soft sedges
2703	metamorphoses	 Placed on a frame and legs of willow it made a couch
2704	metamorphoses	 They covered it with cloths, that they only used to bring out for the times of sacred festivals, but even these were old and worn, not unworthy of the couch
2705	metamorphoses	 The gods were seated
2706	metamorphoses	The old woman, her skirts tucked up, her hands trembling, placed a table there, but a table with one of the three legs unequal: a piece of broken pot made them equal
2707	metamorphoses	 Pushed underneath, it countered the slope, and she wiped the level surface with fresh mint
2708	metamorphoses	 On it she put the black and green olives that belong to pure Minerva, and the cornelian cherries of autumn, preserved in wine lees; radishes and endives; a lump of cheese; and lightly roasted eggs, untouched by the hot ashes; all in clay dishes
2709	metamorphoses	 After this she set out a carved mixing bowl for wine, just as costly, with cups made of beech wood, hollowed out, and lined with yellow bees’ wax
2710	metamorphoses	 There was little delay before the fire provided its hot food, and the wine, of no great age, circulated, and then, removed again, made a little room for the second course
2711	metamorphoses	 There were nuts, and a mix of dried figs and wrinkled dates; plums, and sweet-smelling apples in open wicker baskets; and grapes gathered from the purple vines
2712	metamorphoses	 In the centre was a gleaming honeycomb
2713	metamorphoses	 Above all, there was the additional presence of well-meaning faces, and no unwillingness, or poverty of spirit
2714	metamorphoses	"’
"
2715	metamorphoses	‘Meanwhile the old couple noticed that, as soon as the mixing bowl was empty, it refilled itself, unaided, and the wine appeared of its own accord
2716	metamorphoses	 They were fearful at this strange and astonishing sight, and timidly Baucis and Philemon murmured a prayer, their palms upwards, and begged the gods’ forgiveness for the meal, and their un-preparedness
2717	metamorphoses	 They had a goose, the guard for their tiny cottage: as hosts they prepared to sacrifice it for their divine guests
2718	metamorphoses	 But, quick-winged, it wore the old people out and, for a long time, escaped them, at last appearing to take refuge with the gods themselves
2719	metamorphoses	 Then the heaven-born ones told them not to kill it
2720	metamorphoses	 “We are gods,” they said, “and this neighbourhood will receive just punishment for its impiety, but to you we grant exemption from that evil
2721	metamorphoses	 Just leave your house, and accompany our steps, as we climb that steep mountainside together
2722	metamorphoses	"”
"
2723	metamorphoses	They both obeyed, and leaning on their sticks to ease their climb, they set foot on the long slope
2724	metamorphoses	 When they were as far from the summit as a bowshot might carry, they looked back, and saw everywhere else vanished in the swamp: only their own roof was visible
2725	metamorphoses	 And while they stood amazed at this, mourning their neighbours’ fate, their old cottage, tiny even for the two of them, turned into a temple
2726	metamorphoses	 Wooden poles became pillars, and the reed thatch grew yellow, until a golden roof appeared, richly carved doors, and a marble pavement covering the ground
2727	metamorphoses	 Then the son of Saturn spoke, calmly, to them: “Ask of us, virtuous old man, and you, wife, worthy of a virtuous husband, what you wish
2728	metamorphoses	"”
"
2729	metamorphoses	When he had spoken briefly with Baucis, Philemon revealed their joint request to the gods
2730	metamorphoses	 “We ask to be priests and watch over your temple, and, since we have lived out harmonious years together, let the same hour take the two of us, so that I never have to see my wife’s grave, nor she have to bury me
2731	metamorphoses	” The gods’ assurance followed the prayer
2732	metamorphoses	 They had charge of the temple while they lived: and when they were released by old age, and by the years, as they chanced to be standing by the sacred steps, discussing the subject of their deaths, Baucis saw Philemon put out leaves, and old Philemon saw Baucis put out leaves, and as the tops of the trees grew over their two faces, they exchanged words, while they still could, saying, in the same breath: “Farewell, O dear companion”, as, in the same breath, the bark covered them, concealing their mouths
2733	metamorphoses	The people of Bithynia still show the neighbouring trees there, that sprang from their two bodies
2734	metamorphoses	 Trustworthy old men related these things to me (there was no reason why they should wish to lie)
2735	metamorphoses	 For my part, I saw garlands hanging from the branches, and placing fresh ones there said: “Let those who love the gods become gods: let those who have honoured them, be honoured
2736	metamorphoses	"” ’
"
2737	metamorphoses	Lelex finished, and the tale and the teller of it had moved them all, Theseus particularly
2738	metamorphoses	 He wished to hear more of the marvellous acts of the gods
2739	metamorphoses	 Acheloüs, the river-god of Calydon, leaning on his elbow, said: ‘Hero, there are those who, once changed in form, retain that transformation: there are others who are allowed to transmute into many shapes: you, for instance, Proteus, inhabitant of the earth-encircling sea
2740	metamorphoses	 A moment ago they saw you as a young man, then as a lion: now as a raging boar, then as a serpent, they fear to touch: and, in a moment, horns revealed you as a bull
2741	metamorphoses	 Often you might have appeared as a stone, often, also, as a tree: sometimes, you formed the likeness of running water, and became a river: sometimes fire, water’s opposite
2742	metamorphoses	" 
"
2743	metamorphoses	Mestra, Erysichthon’s daughter, the wife of Autolycus, had no less power
2744	metamorphoses	 Her father was a man scornful of the gods, who burnt no incense on their altars
2745	metamorphoses	 Erysichthon, it is said, once violated the grove of Ceres with an axe, and desecrated the ancient woods with iron
2746	metamorphoses	 Within them stood a great oak, massive with the years, a sacred grove in itself: strands of wool, wreaths of flowers and votive tablets surrounded it, evidence of prayers granted
2747	metamorphoses	 Often beneath it the Dryads held their festive dances: often, also, linking hands, in line, they circled its trunk’s circumference, its massive girth measuring fifteen arm’s-lengths round
2748	metamorphoses	 The other trees were not less far below it than the grass was far below all of them
2749	metamorphoses	 Triopas’s son would not hold back the blade, even for those reasons, commanding his servants to fell the sacred oak
2750	metamorphoses	When he saw them hesitating at the order, the wretched man snatched the axe from one of them, saying: “Though this be, itself, the goddess, not just what the goddess loves, now its leafy crown will meet the earth
2751	metamorphoses	” As he spoke, while he balanced the blade, for the slanting stroke, Ceres’s oak-tree trembled all over and gave a sigh, and at the same time its acorns and its leaves began to whiten, and its long branches grew pale
2752	metamorphoses	 And, when his impious hand made a gash in the trunk, blood poured out of its damaged bark, like the crimson tide from its severed neck, when the mighty bull falls, in sacrifice, before the altar
2753	metamorphoses	All stood astonished, and one of them tried bravely to prevent the evil, and hinder the barbarous double-edged weapon
2754	metamorphoses	 But the Thessalian glared at him, saying: “Here’s the prize for your pious thought!” and swinging his blade at the man not the tree, struck his head from his trunk
2755	metamorphoses	" He was hewing at the oak-tree repeatedly, when the sound of a voice came from inside the oak, chanting these words:
"
2756	metamorphoses	"“I am a nymph, most dear to Ceres,
"
2757	metamorphoses	"under the surface of this wood,
"
2758	metamorphoses	"who prophesy to you, as I die,
"
2759	metamorphoses	"that punishment will follow blood:
"
2760	metamorphoses	out of my ruin, the only good”
2761	metamorphoses	But he pursued his course of evil, and at last, weakened by innumerable blows, and dragged down by ropes, the tree fell, its weight cutting a swathe through the wood
2762	metamorphoses	"’
"
2763	metamorphoses	‘All her sister Dryads, mourning and dressed in black, horrified at the forest’s loss and their own, went to Ceres, and begged her to punish Erysichthon
2764	metamorphoses	 She assented, and, with a motion of her head, that most beautiful of goddesses stirred the fields, heavy with ripened grain
2765	metamorphoses	 She devised a punishment to rouse men’s pity, if his actions had deserved any pity: to torment him with baleful Hunger
2766	metamorphoses	 But since the goddess herself could not approach her (for fate does not allow Famine and Ceres to meet) she called for one of the mountain spirits, an Oread of wild places, and said to her: “There is a place at the furthest bounds of icy Scythia, with sombre, sterile ground, a land without crops or trees
2767	metamorphoses	 Torpid Cold inhabits it, Fear and Trembling and barren Hunger
2768	metamorphoses	 Order Famine to immure herself in the belly of that sacrilegious wretch, and let no plenty oust her, and let her overcome me in any trial of strength
2769	metamorphoses	 So that the length of the journey does not worry you, take my chariot, take my winged dragons, and govern their bridles on high
2770	metamorphoses	” And she gave her the reins
2771	metamorphoses	 The nymph came to Scythia, carried through the air, in the chariot she was given
2772	metamorphoses	 On the summit of a frozen mountain chain (they call the Caucasus) she loosed the dragons’ necks, and, searching for Famine, saw her in a field of stones, picking at the sparse grass with her nails and teeth
2773	metamorphoses	 Her hair was matted, her eyes sunken, her face pallid: her lips were grey with mould, her throat with scabrous sores: through the hardened skin, her inner organs could be seen: dry bones stuck out beneath her hollow loins: her belly was only the excuse for a belly: her breastbone seemed to hang loosely, only held by the frame of her spine
2774	metamorphoses	 Emaciation made the joints look large: the curve of her knees seemed swollen: and the ankles appeared as extravagant lumps
2775	metamorphoses	When the Oread saw her, she relayed the goddess’s command, from a distance (since she did not dare to approach her), and though she only delayed an instant, and stayed far off, though she had only arrived there a moment before, she still seemed to feel the hunger
2776	metamorphoses	 Changing course, high in the air, she directed the dragons towards Haemonia
2777	metamorphoses	Famine carried out Ceres’s orders, though their tasks are ever opposed, and flew down through the eye of the wind to the appointed house
2778	metamorphoses	 Straight away she entered the bedroom of the sacrilegious man, who was sunk in profound sleep (since it was night), and breathed herself into him, covering his throat, and chest, and lips, with her exhalations, and causing a lack of nourishment in his hollow veins
2779	metamorphoses	 Completing her mission, she left the fertile lands, returning to the houses of poverty, and her customary caves
2780	metamorphoses	Gentle Sleep still lulls Erysichthon, with his peaceful wings
2781	metamorphoses	 He, in sleep, in imagination, dreams of feasts, closes his mouth on vacancy, grinds tooth on tooth, exercises his gluttony on insubstantial food, and, instead of a banquet, fruitlessly eats the empty air
2782	metamorphoses	 But when indeed peace departs a desperate desire to eat possesses his famished jaws and burning belly
2783	metamorphoses	 Without a moment’s delay he calls out for whatever earth, air and sea produce, and at table complains of hunger, and in the midst of eating demands to eat
2784	metamorphoses	 What would feed a city, or satisfy a people, is not enough for one
2785	metamorphoses	 The more he puts away inside, the greater his desire
2786	metamorphoses	 As the ocean receives the rivers of all the earth, and unfilled by the waters, swallows every wandering stream: as the devouring flames never refuse more fuel, burn endless timber, and look for more, the greater the piles they are given, more voracious themselves by being fed, so Erysichthon’s profane lips accept and demand all foods, in the same breath
2787	metamorphoses	 All nourishment in him is a reason for nourishment, and always by eating he creates an empty void
2788	metamorphoses	"’
"
2789	metamorphoses	‘Now hunger, and the deep pit of his gut had consumed his wealth, but even so, Famine worked unabated and his burning appetite was unappeased
2790	metamorphoses	 Eventually, when all he owned was inside him, only his daughter, Mestra, was left, a girl whom the father was not worthy of
2791	metamorphoses	 Having nothing, he tried to sell her too
2792	metamorphoses	 The honourable child refused to accept a possessor, and stretching her hands out over the waves of the shore, she cried: “You god, who stole away the prize of my virginity”, for Neptune had stolen it, “save me from slavery
2793	metamorphoses	” He did not scorn her prayer
2794	metamorphoses	 Although the buyer had been following her, and had seen her a moment ago, the god altered her shape, giving her a man’s features, and clothes appropriate to a fisherman
2795	metamorphoses	Her purchaser looked at her, and said: “O, you who control the rod, and hide your bronze hook in a little bait, may you have calm sea, and gullible fish, that feel nothing of the hook until they bite
2796	metamorphoses	 Tell me where she is, the girl with shabby clothes and straggling hair, who stood here on this beach a moment ago (since I saw her, standing on the beach): there are no footprints further on!” She sensed the god’s gift was working well for her, and delighted that he was asking her for news of herself, replied to his question: “Forgive me, whoever you are: I have had no eyes for anything except this pool: I have been occupied taking pains over my fishing
2797	metamorphoses	 To convince you, and may the sea god help me in these arts of mine, no man has been on this beach, except myself, for a long time, and no woman either
2798	metamorphoses	"”
"
2799	metamorphoses	He believed her, and turning round on the sand, having been outplayed, departed
2800	metamorphoses	 Then her true shape was restored
2801	metamorphoses	 When her father realised that she could change her shape, he often surrendered Mestra to others, so that she, escaping in the form of a mare, or a bird, or again as a heifer or a hind, repeatedly obtained her price, dishonestly, for her gluttonous father
2802	metamorphoses	In the end when the evil had consumed everything they had, and his grave disease needed ever more food, Erysichthon began to tear at his limbs and gnaw them with his teeth, and the unhappy man fed, little by little, on his own body
2803	metamorphoses	"’
"
2804	metamorphoses	‘But why do I entertain you with stories of others?’ said Acheloüs, ‘Indeed, young man, I have often changed shape myself, though the number of shapes I can achieve is limited
2805	metamorphoses	 Sometimes I am seen as I am now: sometimes I become a snake: or, again, the lead bull of the herd, my power in my horns – horns, when I still had two
2806	metamorphoses	 Now one side of my brow has lost its weapon, as you can see for yourself
2807	metamorphoses	’ His words were followed by a sigh
2808	metamorphoses	Theseus, the hero, reputed son of Neptune, asked Acheloüs why he had sighed, and the reason for his damaged forehead: to which the Calydonian river-god, his uncut hair wreathed with reeds, replied: ‘You ask something painful of me
2809	metamorphoses	 Who wants to recall the battles he has lost? But, I will tell it as it happened: since the shame of being beaten is no less than the honour of having fought
2810	metamorphoses	 It is a great consolation to me that the victor was so famous
2811	metamorphoses	If her name has ever come to your notice, Deianira was once the most beautiful girl, and the jealous hope of many suitors
2812	metamorphoses	 When, with them, I entered Oeneus’s house, her father, and the man I sought as my father-in-law, I said: “Accept me as your son-in-law, son of Parthaon
2813	metamorphoses	” Hercules, scion of Alceus, said the same
2814	metamorphoses	 The others gave way before the two of us
2815	metamorphoses	 Hercules declared that he could offer Jove as his bride’s father-in-law, spoke of his famous labours, and of how he had survived what his stepmother, Juno, had prescribed for him
2816	metamorphoses	 On my side I said: “It would be shameful for a god to concede to a mortal” – He was not yet a god – “In me you see the lord of the waters, that flow in winding rivers, through your kingdom
2817	metamorphoses	 As your son-in-law I would not be a stranger sent from a foreign shore, but a native, and wedded to your own interests
2818	metamorphoses	" Only don’t let it harm my case that Queen Juno does not hate me, and all the punishment of the labours, she demanded, passed me by!”
"
2819	metamorphoses	“Now, listen, Hercules, you, son of Alcmena: Jupiter, whose child you boast of being, is either wrongly called your father, or is truly a wrongdoer
2820	metamorphoses	 You seek your father in a mother’s adultery
2821	metamorphoses	 Choose whether you prefer this fiction of Jove as a father, or to be born the son of shame
2822	metamorphoses	” As I spoke, he gazed at me fiercely, all the while, and unable to act like a man and control his blazing anger, he merely replied in these words: “My right hand is more powerful than my tongue
2823	metamorphoses	 As long as I beat you at wrestling, you can win the talking”, and he came at me ferociously
2824	metamorphoses	 I was ashamed to retreat, after my words: I took off my green robes; put up my arms; held my hands, fingers curved, in front of my chest in fighting stance; and readied my limbs for the match
2825	metamorphoses	 He caught up dust in the hollow of his hands and threw it over me, and, in turn, was, himself, gilded by the yellow sand
2826	metamorphoses	 Now he caught at my neck, or you might think he caught me, now at my legs, now at my loins: and attacked me from every side
2827	metamorphoses	 My weight protected me, and his attempts were useless
2828	metamorphoses	 I was like a massive pile that the roaring flood assaults with all its might: it remains, secure in its own bulk
2829	metamorphoses	We pulled away for a moment, returned to the conflict, and stood firm, determined not to concede
2830	metamorphoses	 Foot was set against foot, and I pushed at him, with my chest full forward, fingers locked with fingers, and head to head
2831	metamorphoses	 I have seen two strong bulls come together like that, when they try for the sleekest heifer in the pasture as their prize in the contest
2832	metamorphoses	 The herd watches in fear, not sure to which one victory will grant overriding supremacy
2833	metamorphoses	 Three times without success Hercules tried to push my gleaming chest away from him
2834	metamorphoses	 At the fourth attempt, he broke my grip, loosed himself from my constricting arms, and with a blow of his hand – certainly, I myself confess it is the truth – he turned me about, and clung, with all his weight, to my back
2835	metamorphoses	If you can believe it - I am not seeking to gain false credit by saying it – I seemed to have a mountain pressing on top of me
2836	metamorphoses	 With difficulty I thrust my arms, pouring with sweat from the great effort it took, under him, and, with difficulty, freed his firm hold on my body
2837	metamorphoses	 He pressed me hard, as I gasped for breath, prevented me from gathering my strength, and gripped my neck
2838	metamorphoses	 Then, at last, my knee touched the ground, and my mouth tasted sand
2839	metamorphoses	 Inferior to him in strength, I turned to my magic arts, and slipped from his grasp in the shape of a long snake
2840	metamorphoses	 But when I had wound my body in sinuous coils, and, hissing fiercely, darted my forked tongue at him, Tiryns’s hero laughed, and mocking my magic arts, said: “My task in the cradle was to defeat snakes, and, though you are greater than other reptiles, Acheloüs, how big a slice of the Lernean Hydra would your one serpent be? It was made fecund by its wounds, and not one of its hundred heads was safely cut off without its neck generating two more
2841	metamorphoses	 I overcame it, and having overcome it, disembowelled that monster, with branching snake-heads, that grew from their own destruction, thriving on evil
2842	metamorphoses	" What do you think will happen to you, who are only a false snake, using unfamiliar weapons, whom a shifting form hides?”
"
2843	metamorphoses	He spoke and knotted his fingers round my throat
2844	metamorphoses	 I was suffocating, as if my throat was gripped by a vice, and struggled to tear his thumbs away from my windpipe
2845	metamorphoses	 Overpowered in this form, only my third, fierce, bull-shape remained
2846	metamorphoses	 So I fought on, my limbs those of a bull
2847	metamorphoses	 From the left he threw his arms round my bulging neck; and followed me as I charged off; dragging at me, my horns piercing the hard ground as he pulled me down; and toppling me into the deep sand
2848	metamorphoses	 As if that was not enough, holding the tough horn in his cruel hand, he broke it and tore it away from my mutilated brow
2849	metamorphoses	 The Naiades took it, filling it with fruit and scented flowers, and made it sacred: the Goddess of Abundance is rich now because of my horn of plenty
2850	metamorphoses	"”
"
2851	metamorphoses	He spoke: and a nymph, one of his attendants, dressed like Diana, her hair streaming over her shoulders, came to them, bringing all of autumn’s harvest in an overflowing horn, and, for an aftertaste, delicious fruits
2852	metamorphoses	 Light gathered, and as the first rays struck the mountain summits, the warriors left, not waiting for the river to flow calmly and placidly or for the falling waters to subside
2853	metamorphoses	 Acheloüs hid his wild features and his head, marred by its broken horn, in the depths of the waves
2854	metamorphoses	Nevertheless he only had the loss of that adornment, which had been taken from him, to lament: he was otherwise unhurt
2855	metamorphoses	 Also he hid his loss with a wreath of willow leaves or reeds
2856	metamorphoses	 But you, fierce Nessus, the centaur, a passion for that same virgin girl destroyed you, hit in the back by a flying arrow
2857	metamorphoses	Hercules, son of Jupiter, on his way to his native city with Deianira, his new bride, came to the swift waters of the River Euenus
2858	metamorphoses	 The flood was higher than normal, increased by winter rains, with frequent whirlpools, and impassable
2859	metamorphoses	 He had no fear of going on himself, but was anxious for his bride, when Nessus approached, strong of limb, and knowing the fords
2860	metamorphoses	 ‘With my help, Alcides,” he said, “she will be set down on the far bank
2861	metamorphoses	 Use your strength to swim!” The Theban handed over the Calydonian girl, she, pale with fear, frightened of the river and of the centaur himself
2862	metamorphoses	Straight away, weighed down as he was by his quiver and his lion’s skin - he had thrown his club and his curved bow across to the other bank – the hero said: ‘Let me endure the river since I have started to cross
2863	metamorphoses	’ He did not hesitate, and did not search for where the river was calmest, scorning to claim the water’s allegiance
2864	metamorphoses	 He had gained the bank, and was picking up the bow he had thrown, when he heard his wife’s voice, and shouted to Nessus, who was preparing to betray his trust: ‘Where are you carrying her off to, you rapist, trusting in vain to your swiftness of foot? I am speaking to you, Nessus, the twice-formed
2865	metamorphoses	 Listen: do not steal what is mine
2866	metamorphoses	 If you have no respect for me, the thought of your father, Ixion, on his whirling wheel might prevent this illicit union
2867	metamorphoses	 However much you trust in your horse-craft, you will not escape
2868	metamorphoses	 With wounds, not feet, I will follow you
2869	metamorphoses	’ He made good his last words with his actions, shooting the arrow he fired, across, at the fleeing back
2870	metamorphoses	 The barbed tip jutted from the centaur’s chest
2871	metamorphoses	 When the shaft was pulled out, blood, mixed with the deadly arrow-poison of the Lernean Hydra, gushed out simultaneously from the entry and exit wounds
2872	metamorphoses	 Nessus trapped this, and murmured, to himself of course: ‘I will not die without revenge’ and gave his tunic soaked with warm blood to Deianira, whom he had abducted, presenting it to her as if it were a gift for reviving a waning love
2873	metamorphoses	A long space of intervening time passed by, and the tales of mighty Hercules had filled the world, and overcome his stepmother’s hatred
2874	metamorphoses	 As the victor at Oechalia, in Euboea (where he had avenged an insult offered him by King Eurytus) he was preparing to sacrifice to Jupiter at Cenaeum, when loquacious Rumour, who loves to add lies to fact, and expands from the tiniest truth by her falsehoods, brought her tale on ahead, to your ears, Deianira
2875	metamorphoses	 She claimed that Hercules, reputed son of Amphitryon, was filled with passion for Iole, daughter of Eurytus
2876	metamorphoses	The loving wife believes it, and terrified at first by the rumour of this new affair, she indulges in tears, and the poor girl vents her misery in weeping
2877	metamorphoses	 But she soon says ‘Why do I weep? That adulteress will laugh at my tears
2878	metamorphoses	 Since she is coming here, I must plan quickly, while I can, while another has not yet taken my place
2879	metamorphoses	" Should I complain, or keep silent? Return to Calydon or stay? Should I leave my house? Or, if I can do nothing else, should I at least stand in their way? What if, remembering I am your sister, Meleager, I prepare, boldly, to commit a crime, and, by cutting that adulteress’s throat, show what revenge and a woman’s grief can do?’
"
2880	metamorphoses	Her thought traced various courses
2881	metamorphoses	 Of all of them she preferred that of sending the shirt, imbued with Nessus’s blood, to restore her husband’s waning love
2882	metamorphoses	 Unwittingly, she entrusted what became her future grief, to the servant, Lichas, he not knowing what he had been entrusted with: and the unfortunate woman, ordered him, with persuasive words, to give the present to her husband
2883	metamorphoses	 Hercules, the hero, took it, without a thought, and put on the shirt of Nessus, soaked in the poison of the Lernean Hydra
2884	metamorphoses	He was making offerings of incense and reciting prayers over the first flames, and pouring a libation bowl of wine on to the marble altar
2885	metamorphoses	 The power of the venom, warmed and released by the flames, dissolved, dispersing widely through the limbs of Hercules
2886	metamorphoses	 With his usual courage, he repressed his groans while he could
2887	metamorphoses	 When his strength to endure the venom was exhausted, he overturned the altar, and filled woody Oeta with his shouts
2888	metamorphoses	He tries at once to tear off the fatal clothing: where it is pulled away, it pulls skin away with it, and, revolting to tell, it either sticks to the limbs from which he tries in vain to remove it, or reveals the lacerated limbs and his massive bones
2889	metamorphoses	 His blood itself hisses and boils, with the virulence of the poison, like incandescent metal, dipped in a cold pool
2890	metamorphoses	 There is no end to it: the consuming fires suck at the air in his chest: dark sweat pours from his whole body: his scorched sinews crackle
2891	metamorphoses	 His marrow liquefying with the secret corruption, he raises his hands to the heavens, crying: ‘Juno, Saturnia, feed on my ruin: feed, cruel one: gaze, from the heights, at this destruction, and sate your savage heart! Or if this suffering seems pitiable even to an enemy, even to you, take away this sorrowful and hateful life, with its fearful torments, that was only made for toil
2892	metamorphoses	 Death would be a gift to me, a fitting offering from a stepmother
2893	metamorphoses	Was it for this I overcame Busiris who defiled the temples with the blood of sacrificed strangers? For this that I lifted fierce Antaeus, robbing him of the strength of his mother Earth? For this, that I was unmoved, by Geryon’s triple form, the herdsman of Spain, or your triple form, Cerberus? For this, you hands of mine, that you dragged down the horns of the strong Cretan bull: that the stables of King Augeas of Elis know of your efforts: the Stymphalian Lake: and the woods of Mount Parthenius, with its golden-antlered stag? For this, that, by your virtue, the gold engraved girdle of Hippolyte of Thermodon was taken, and the apples of the Hesperides, guarded by the sleepless dragon? Was it for this, that the Centaurs could not withstand me, nor the Erymanthian Boar that laid Arcady waste? For this, that it did not help the Hydra to thrive on destruction and gain redoubled strength? What of the time when I saw Thracian Diomede’s horses, fed on human blood, their stalls filled with broken bodies, and, seeing them, overthrew them, and finished off them, and their master? The Nemean Lion lies crushed by these massive arms: and for Atlas these shoulders of mine held up the sky
2894	metamorphoses	 Jupiter’s cruel consort is tired of giving commands: I am not tired of performing them
2895	metamorphoses	But now a strange disease affects me that I cannot withstand by courage, weapons or strength
2896	metamorphoses	 Deep in my lungs a devouring fire wanders, feeding on my whole body
2897	metamorphoses	 But Eurystheus, my enemy is well! Are there those then who can believe that the gods exist?’ So saying he roamed, in his illness, over the heights of Oeta, as a bull carries around a hunting spear embedded in its body, though the hunter who threw it has long gone
2898	metamorphoses	 Picture him there, in the mountains, in his anger, often groaning, often shouting out, often attempting, again and again, to rid himself of the last of the garment, overturning trees, or stretching his arms out to his native skies
2899	metamorphoses	Then he caught sight of the terrified Lichas, cowering in a hollow of the cliff, and pain concentrated all his fury
2900	metamorphoses	 ‘Was it not you, Lichas,’ he said, ‘who gave me this fatal gift? Are you not the agent of my death?’ The man trembled, grew pale with fear, and, timidly, made excuses
2901	metamorphoses	 While he was speaking, and trying to clasp the hero’s knees, Alcides seized him, and, swinging him round three or four times, hurled him, more violently than a catapult bolt, into the Euboean waters
2902	metamorphoses	 Hanging in the air, he hardened with the wind
2903	metamorphoses	 As rain freezes in the icy blasts and becomes snow; whirling snowflakes bind together in a soft mass; and they, in turn, accumulate as a body of solid hailstones: so he, the ancient tradition says, flung by strong arms through the void, bloodless with fright, and devoid of moisture, turned to hard flint
2904	metamorphoses	 Now, in the Euboean Gulf, a low rock rises out of the depths, and keeps the semblance of a human shape
2905	metamorphoses	 This sailors are afraid to set foot on, as though it could sense them, and they call it, Lichas
2906	metamorphoses	" 
"
2907	metamorphoses	But you, famous son of Jove, felled the trees that grew on steep Oeta, and made a funeral pyre, and commanded Philoctetes, son of Poeas, who supplied the flame that was plunged into it, to take your bow, your ample quiver, and the arrows, that were fated to see, once more, the kingdom of Troy (as they did when you rescued Hesione
2908	metamorphoses	) As the mass caught light from the eager fire, you spread the Nemean Lion’s pelt on the summit of the pile of logs, and lay down, your neck resting on your club, and with an aspect no different from that of a guest, reclining amongst the full wine cups, crowned with garlands
2909	metamorphoses	Now the fierce flames, spreading on every side, were crackling loudly, and licking at his body, he unconcerned and scornful of them
2910	metamorphoses	 The gods were fearful for earth’s champion
2911	metamorphoses	 Saturnian Jupiter spoke to them, gladly, since he understood their feelings
2912	metamorphoses	 ‘O divine beings, your fear for him delights me, and I willingly congratulate myself, with all my heart, that I am called father and ruler of a thoughtful race, and that my offspring is protected by your favour also
2913	metamorphoses	 Though this tribute is paid to his great deeds, I am obliged to you, also
2914	metamorphoses	 But do not allow your loyal hearts to feel groundless fears
2915	metamorphoses	 Forget Oeta’s flames! He, who has defeated all things, will defeat the fires you see, nor will he feel Vulcan’s power, except in the mortal part that he owes to his mother, Alcmene
2916	metamorphoses	 What he has from me is immortal, deathless and eternal: and that, no flame can destroy
2917	metamorphoses	 When it is done with the earth, I will accept it into the celestial regions, and I trust my action will please all the gods
2918	metamorphoses	 But if there is anyone, anyone at all, who is unhappy at Hercules’s deification, and would not wish to grant this gift, he or she should know that it was given for merit, and should approve it, though unwillingly
2919	metamorphoses	’ The gods agreed
2920	metamorphoses	 Juno, also, appeared to accept the rest of his words with compliance, but not the last ones, upset that she was being censored
2921	metamorphoses	Meanwhile, Mulciber had consumed whatever the flames could destroy, and no recognisable form of Hercules remained, no semblance of what came to him from his mother: he only retained his inheritance from Jove
2922	metamorphoses	 As a snake enjoys its newness, sloughing old age with its skin, gleaming with fresh scales; so, when the Tirynthian hero had shed his mortal body, he became his better part, beginning to appear greater, and more to be revered, in his high majesty
2923	metamorphoses	 The all-powerful father of the gods carrying him upwards, in his four-horse chariot, through the substance-less clouds, set him among the shining stars
2924	metamorphoses	Atlas felt the weight of the new constellation
2925	metamorphoses	 But even now the anger of Eurystheus, son of Sthenelus, was not appeased, and he pursued his unyielding hatred of the father through the children
2926	metamorphoses	 Argive Alcmena, troubled by endless cares, had Iole, as one to whom she could confide an old woman’s miseries, to whom she could relate her son’s labours, known to all the world, and her own misfortunes
2927	metamorphoses	 At Hercules request, Hyllus, his son by Deianira, had taken Iole to his marriage-bed, and his heart, and had planted a child of that noble race in her womb
2928	metamorphoses	 Alcmena said to her: ‘Let the gods at least favour you, and shorten that time when, in childbirth, you call on Ilithyia, that Lucina who watches over frightened women, who, thanks to Juno’s influence, made things hard for me
2929	metamorphoses	When the time for Hercules’s difficult birth came, and Capricorn, the tenth sign, was hidden by the sun, the weight of the child stretched my womb: what I carried was so great, you could tell that Jove was the father of my hidden burden
2930	metamorphoses	 I could not bear my labour pains much longer
2931	metamorphoses	 Even now, as I speak, a cold horror grips my body, and part of me remembers it with pain
2932	metamorphoses	 Tortured for seven nights and as many days, worn out with agony, stretching my arms to heaven, with a great cry, I called out to Lucina, and her companion gods of birth, the Nixi
2933	metamorphoses	 Indeed, she came, but committed in advance, determined to surrender my life to unjust Juno
2934	metamorphoses	 She sat on the altar, in front of the door, and listened to my groans
2935	metamorphoses	 With her right knee crossed over her left, and clasped with interlocking fingers, she held back the birth, She murmured spells, too, in a low voice, and the spells halted the birth once it began
2936	metamorphoses	 I laboured, and, maddened, made useless outcries against ungrateful Jove
2937	metamorphoses	 I wanted to die, and my moans would have moved the flinty rocks
2938	metamorphoses	 The Theban women who were there, took up my prayers, and gave me encouragement in my pain
2939	metamorphoses	Tawny-haired, Galanthis, one of my servant-girls, was there, humbly born but faithful in carrying out orders, loved by me for the services she rendered
2940	metamorphoses	 She sensed that unjust Juno was up to something, and, as she was often in and out of the house, she saw the goddess, Lucina, squatting on the altar, arms linked by her fingers, clasping her knees, and said ‘Whoever you are, congratulate the mistress
2941	metamorphoses	 Alcmena of Argolis is eased, and the prayers to aid childbirth have been answered
2942	metamorphoses	"’
"
2943	metamorphoses	The goddess with power over the womb leapt up in consternation, releasing her clasped hands: by releasing the bonds, herself, easing the birth
2944	metamorphoses	 They say Galanthis laughed at the duped goddess
2945	metamorphoses	 As she laughed, the heaven-born one, in her anger, caught her by the hair, and dragged her down, and as she tried to lift her body from the ground, she arched her over, and changed her arms into forelegs
2946	metamorphoses	 Her old energy remained, and the hair on her back did not lose her hair’s previous colour: but her former shape was changed to that of a weasel
2947	metamorphoses	 And because her lying mouth helped in childbirth, she gives birth through her mouth, and frequents my house, as before
2948	metamorphoses	"’
"
2949	metamorphoses	She finished speaking, and sighed, her feelings stirred by the memory of her former servant
2950	metamorphoses	 While she grieved, her daughter-in-law, Iole, said: ‘Mother, this is still the altered form of someone not of our blood that affects you
2951	metamorphoses	 What if I were to relate to you my sister’s strange fate? Though sadness and tears hold me back, and hinder me from talking
2952	metamorphoses	 Dryope was her mother’s only child – I was my father’s by another wife – and she was known as the most beautiful girl in Oechalia
2953	metamorphoses	 Suffering the assault of Apollo, that god who holds Delphi and Delos; her virginity lost; Andraemon married her; and was considered fortunate to have her as his wife
2954	metamorphoses	There is a lake, whose sloping shoreline is formed by steep banks, their summits crowned with myrtle
2955	metamorphoses	 Dryope went there, unaware of any restrictions, and, to make what happened more unacceptable, bringing garlands for the nymphs
2956	metamorphoses	 At her breast she carried a sweet burden, her son, not yet a year old, whom she was suckling with her warm milk
2957	metamorphoses	 Not far away, a water-loving lotus tree flowered from the swamp, with the promise of fruits to come, its colours imitating Tyrian purples
2958	metamorphoses	 Dryope picked some of these blossoms, to offer the child as playthings, and I was looking to do the same - I was with her - when I saw drops of blood fall from the flowers, and the branches move with a shiver of fear
2959	metamorphoses	 It appears, as the locals now tell us, at last, but too late, that Lotis, a nymph, running from obscene Priapus, turned into the tree, altering her features, keeping her name
2960	metamorphoses	My sister had known nothing of this
2961	metamorphoses	 When she wished to retreat, in fear, from the place, and escape by praying to the nymphs, her feet clung like roots
2962	metamorphoses	 She struggled to tear them away, but nothing moved except her torso
2963	metamorphoses	 Slowly, thick bark grew upward from her feet, hiding all her groin
2964	metamorphoses	 When she saw this, and tried to tear at her hair, with her hands, her hands filled with leaves: leaves covered her whole head
2965	metamorphoses	 But the child, Amphissos (so his grandfather, Eurytus, King of Oechalia, had named him) felt his mother’s breast harden, and the milky liquid failed when he sucked
2966	metamorphoses	 I was there, a spectator of your cruel destiny, sister, and could bring you no help at all
2967	metamorphoses	 Only, as far as I could, I held back the developing trunk and branches with my embrace, and I bear witness that I longed to be sheathed in that same bark
2968	metamorphoses	Then her husband, Andraemon, and her luckless father, Eurytus, came, asking for Dryope: the Dryope they searched for I revealed as the lotus
2969	metamorphoses	 They kissed the living wood, and prostrate on the ground clung to the roots of their tree
2970	metamorphoses	 You, my dear sister, displayed nothing but your face that was not already tree
2971	metamorphoses	 Your tears rained on the leaves of your poor body, and while your mouth left a path for your voice, while you still could, you poured out your lament like this into the air: “If there is truth in suffering, I swear by the gods I do not deserve this wrong
2972	metamorphoses	 I am being punished without guilt
2973	metamorphoses	 I lived in innocence
2974	metamorphoses	 If I lie, let me lose the leaves I have through drought, be levelled with the axe, and burned
2975	metamorphoses	 Take this child from these maternal branches, and find him a nurse, and have him often drink his milk under this tree of mine, and play under this tree
2976	metamorphoses	 And when he learns to talk, have him greet his mother and say, sadly, ‘My mother is revealed in this tree
2977	metamorphoses	’ Let him still fear lakes, and pick no flowers from the trees, and think all shrubs are the body of the goddess
2978	metamorphoses	Dear husband, farewell, and you, sister; father! If you love me, defend me from the sharp knife, and my leaves from the browsing herd
2979	metamorphoses	 And since I am not allowed to bend to you, reach up with your arms, and find my lips, while I can still feel, and lift my little son up to me! I can speak no more
2980	metamorphoses	 Now the soft sapwood spreads slowly over my white neck: I am imprisoned in its highest reaches
2981	metamorphoses	 Take your hands from my eyes
2982	metamorphoses	 Without trying to help me, allow the enveloping bark to mask the fading light!” At the moment her mouth ceased speaking, at that moment it ceased to be
2983	metamorphoses	 For a long time, the freshly created branches glowed with warmth, from her altered body
2984	metamorphoses	"’
"
2985	metamorphoses	While Eurytus’s daughter was relating this marvellous happening, and Alcmena was wiping away Iole’s tears (still weeping herself) a wonderful thing suspended all sadness
2986	metamorphoses	 There, on the steep threshold, stood Iolaüs, Hercules’s nephew and companion, alive again, with the look of his early years, a hint of down on his cheeks, almost, again, a child
2987	metamorphoses	 Overwhelmed by the prayers of her husband, Hercules, Juno’s daughter, Hebe, had granted him this gift
2988	metamorphoses	 When she was about to swear that, after this, she would never allow any further such favour, Themis would not allow it
2989	metamorphoses	She prophesied
2990	metamorphoses	 ‘Thebes is now moving towards civil war, and, of the Seven against her, Capaneus will not be overcome, except by Jupiter himself
2991	metamorphoses	 Two brothers, Eteocles and Polynices, will die of mutually inflicted wounds
2992	metamorphoses	 Amphiaraüs, the seer, swallowed by the earth, still living, will gaze on the ghosts of his own dead
2993	metamorphoses	 His son, Alcmaeon, shall avenge him, with his mother Eriphyle’s death, filial and sinful in the same act
2994	metamorphoses	 Terrified at his own evil, exiled from home and sanity, he will be pursued by the faces of the Eumenides, and by his mother’s shade, until his wife, Callirhoë demands the fatal necklace, that Venus gave Harmonia, and until the sword, of his first father-in-law, Phegeus, in the hands of Phegeus’s sons, shall drain his son-in-law’s blood
2995	metamorphoses	 Then at last, Callirhoë, the daughter of Acheloüs, as a suppliant, will ask of mighty Jupiter to add years to her infant sons, and not allow the avenger’s murder to be unavenged
2996	metamorphoses	 In anticipation of being moved by her prayers, Jupiter claims for them this gift that you, his stepdaughter and daughter-in-law, possess, and will make them men, in their childhood years
2997	metamorphoses	"’
"
2998	metamorphoses	When Themis spoke these words, out of her prophetic mouth, prescient of what was to come, the gods complained in various mutterings, and there was a murmur as to why they were not able to grant the same gift to other mortals
2999	metamorphoses	 Aurora, daughter of the Titan Pallas, lamented the old age of her husband, Tithonus
3000	metamorphoses	 Gentle Ceres lamented the greying hair of her former lover Iasion
3001	metamorphoses	 Mulciber demanded another lifetime for his son, Erichthonius: and Venus, also, touched by fears for the future, wanted to bargain for the renewal of her lover Anchises’s years
3002	metamorphoses	 Each god had someone whose cause they supported: and the troublesome mutiny, over their favourites, grew, until Jupiter opened his mouth and said: ‘O, if you have any respect for me, where do you think all this talk is heading? Do any of you think you can overcome fate as well? Through fate Iolaüs’s past years were restored
3003	metamorphoses	 Through fate Callirhoë’s children must prematurely become men, not through ambition or warfare
3004	metamorphoses	 Even you, and I, too, fate rules, if that also makes you feel better
3005	metamorphoses	 If I had power to alter fate, these late years would not bow down my pious Aeacus
3006	metamorphoses	 Just Rhadamanthus would always possess youth’s flower, and my Minos, who is scorned because of the bitter weight of old age, and no longer orders the kingdom in the way he did before
3007	metamorphoses	"’
"
3008	metamorphoses	Jupiter’s words swayed the gods: and no one could sustain their objection when they saw Rhadamanthos, Aeacus and Minos wearied with the years
3009	metamorphoses	 When he was in his prime, Minos had made great nations tremble at his very name: now he was weak, and feared Miletus, who was proud of his strength and parentage, the son of Phoebus Apollo and the nymph Deione
3010	metamorphoses	 Though Minos believed Miletus might plot an insurrection, he still did not dare to deny him his home
3011	metamorphoses	 On your own initiative, Miletus, you left, cutting the waters of the Aegean in your swift ship, and built a city on the soil of Asia, that still carries its founder’s name
3012	metamorphoses	There you knew Cyanee, the daughter of Maeander, whose stream so often curves back on itself, when she was following her father’s winding shores
3013	metamorphoses	 Twin children were born to her, of outstanding beauty of body, Byblis and her brother Caunus
3014	metamorphoses	Byblis, seized by a passion, for her brother, scion of Apollo; that Byblis serves for a warning to girls, against illicit love
3015	metamorphoses	 She loved, not as a sister loves a brother, nor as she should
3016	metamorphoses	 At first, it is true, she did not understand the fires of passion, or think it wrong, to kiss, together, often, or throw her arms round her brother’s neck
3017	metamorphoses	 For a long time she was deceived by the misleading likeness to sisterly affection
3018	metamorphoses	 Gradually the nature of her love went astray, and she came looking for her brother carefully dressed, and over-anxious to look beautiful
3019	metamorphoses	 If anyone seemed more beautiful to him, she was jealous
3020	metamorphoses	 But her own feelings were not clear to her, and though she had no inner longing for passion, nevertheless it burned
3021	metamorphoses	 And now she called him her lord, now she hated the name that made them related, now she wrongly wished him to call her Byblis, rather than sister
3022	metamorphoses	 While she is awake she still dare not allow her mind its illicit hope, but, deep in peaceful dreams, she often sees what she loves, and is also seen, held in her brother’s arms, and she blushes, though lost in sleep
3023	metamorphoses	When sleep has vanished, she lies there for a long time, recalling, to herself, the imagery of her dream, and at last utters these inner doubts: ‘Alas for me! What does it mean, this vision out of the night’s silence? How I would hate it to be true! Why do I see these things in sleep? He is truly handsome, even to unfriendly eyes, and is pleasing, and if he were not my brother I could love him, and he would be worthy of me
3024	metamorphoses	 Being his sister is the reality that harms me
3025	metamorphoses	 Let sleep often return with similar visions, as long as I am not tempted to do any such thing while awake! A dream lacks witnesses, but does not lack pleasure’s counterpart
3026	metamorphoses	 By winged Cupid, and Venus, his tender mother, how great the joy I had! How clearly passion touched me! How my whole heart melted where I lay! What joy in remembrance! Though its pleasure was short-lived, and night rushed onwards, envious of my imaginings
3027	metamorphoses	O if I could have been joined to you, with another’s name, Caunus, how good a daughter-in-law I could have been to your father! O Caunus, how good a son-in-law you could have been to my father! We would have had everything shared between us, except our grandparents: I would have wanted you to be nobler than me! You, most beautiful one, will make someone else the mother of your children, but to me, whom evil luck has given the same parents, you will be nothing but a brother
3028	metamorphoses	 What separates us: that we will share as one
3029	metamorphoses	 What does my vision signify to me? What weight indeed do dreams have? Or perhaps - the gods forbid - dreams do have weight? Certainly, the gods have possessed their sisters
3030	metamorphoses	 So, Saturn led Ops, his blood-kin, to join with him, and Oceanus, Tethys, and the ruler of Olympus, Juno
3031	metamorphoses	 The gods have their own laws! Why try to relate human affairs to other, divine, behaviour? Either my forbidden passion will be driven from my heart, or if I cannot achieve that, I pray to be loved, before I am laid out on my deathbed, and my brother kisses me there
3032	metamorphoses	 Yet that needs both our wills! Suppose it pleases me: it may seem a sin to him
3033	metamorphoses	Still, the sons of Aeolus, god of the winds, were not afraid to marry their sisters! Where did I learn that? Why do I have such ready examples? Where is this leading? Vanish, far off, illicit flames, and let my brother not be loved, except as a sister may love him! Yet, if he himself were first captured by love of me, I might perhaps be able to indulge this madness
3034	metamorphoses	 Then let me woo him, whom I would not reject, if he were wooing! - Can you say it? Can you acknowledge it? - Love compels me: I can! Or if shame closes my lips, a secret letter will confess my hidden passions
3035	metamorphoses	"’
"
3036	metamorphoses	This idea pleases her, and this decision overcomes the doubt in her mind
3037	metamorphoses	 Turning on one side and leaning on her left elbow, she says to herself: ‘Let him know: let me acknowledge my insane desires! Alas, where am I heading? What fire has my heart conceived?’ And, with a trembling hand, she begins to set down the words she has contemplated
3038	metamorphoses	 She holds the pen in her right hand, and a blank wax tablet in her left
3039	metamorphoses	 She begins, then hesitates; writes and condemns the writing; scribbles and smoothes it out; alters, blames and approves; in turn lays down what she has lifted, and lifts what she has laid down
3040	metamorphoses	 She does not know what to do, displeased with whatever she is about to do
3041	metamorphoses	 In her expression, shame is mixed with boldness
3042	metamorphoses	She had written ‘sister’, but decided to efface the name of sister, and inscribed these words on the corrected tablet: ‘That wish, for long life, that she will not have, unless you grant it, one who loves you sends to you
3043	metamorphoses	 She is ashamed, oh, ashamed to tell her name
3044	metamorphoses	 And if you ask what I desire, I would have wished to plead my cause, namelessly, and not to have been identified, until the expectation of what I desired was certain, as Byblis
3045	metamorphoses	True, you might have seen signs of my wounded heart in my pallor, thinness, features, eyes full of tears, sighs with no apparent cause, frequent embraces, kisses, which, if you had chanced to notice, might not have felt like a sister’s
3046	metamorphoses	 Yet, though my soul was deeply stricken, though the mad fire is in me, I have done everything I can (the gods are my witnesses) to become calmer
3047	metamorphoses	 For a long time I have struggled, unhappily, to escape Cupid’s onslaught, and I have suffered more hardship than you would think a girl could suffer
3048	metamorphoses	 I am compelled to confess, I have lost, and to beg your help, with humble prayers
3049	metamorphoses	 You alone can save your lover, you alone destroy her
3050	metamorphoses	 Choose what you will
3051	metamorphoses	 It is not your enemy who prays to you, but one who, though closest to you, seeks to be closer still, and bound to you with a tighter bond
3052	metamorphoses	Let old people know what is right, and what is allowed, and what is virtue and what is sin, and preserve the fine balance of the law
3053	metamorphoses	 At our age Love is what is fitting, that takes no heed
3054	metamorphoses	 We do not know yet what is permitted, and we consider all things permitted, and follow the example of the great gods
3055	metamorphoses	 We have no harsh father, no regard for reputation, and no fear to impede us
3056	metamorphoses	 Even if there were cause for fear, we can hide sweet theft under the names of brother and sister
3057	metamorphoses	 I am free to speak to you in private, and we can embrace and kiss in front of others
3058	metamorphoses	 How important is what is still lacking? Pity the one who confesses her love, and would not confess if extreme desire did not force her, and do not you be the reason for the writing on my tomb
3059	metamorphoses	"’
"
3060	metamorphoses	Her handwriting filled the wax, with these fruitless words, the last line close to the edge
3061	metamorphoses	 Immediately she put her seal on the sinful message, dampening it with her tears (moisture failed her tongue), stamping it with her signet ring
3062	metamorphoses	 Shamefacedly, she called one of her servants, and shyly and coaxingly said: ‘You are most faithful
3063	metamorphoses	 Take these to my
3064	metamorphoses	brother’ she added after a long silence
3065	metamorphoses	 As she let them go, the tablets slipped and fell from her hand
3066	metamorphoses	 She still sent the letter, troubled by the omen
3067	metamorphoses	 Finding a suitable time, the messenger went, and delivered the hidden words
3068	metamorphoses	 Horrified, Maeander’s grandson, suddenly enraged, hurled away the tablets he had accepted, and partly read, and, scarcely able to keep his hands from the trembling servant’s throat, cried: ‘Run while you can, you rascally aide to forbidden lust! I would deal you death, as a punishment, if your fate would not also drag our honour down with it
3069	metamorphoses	’ The servant fled in fear, and reported Caunus’s fierce words, to Byblis
3070	metamorphoses	She grew pale, hearing that she had been rejected, and her body shook, gripped by an icy chill
3071	metamorphoses	 But, when consciousness returned, so did the passion, and, she let out these words, her lips scarcely moving: ‘I deserve it! Well, why did I rashly reveal my wound? Why was I in such a hurry to commit things, which were secret, to a hasty letter? I should have tested his mind’s judgement before by ambiguous words
3072	metamorphoses	 I should have observed how the winds blew; used other lesser sails, in case those breezes were not to be followed; and crossed the sea in safety, not as now, under full canvas, caught by uncertain gusts
3073	metamorphoses	 So I am carried onto the rocks, swamped, overwhelmed by the whole ocean, and my sails have no means of retreat
3074	metamorphoses	"’
"
3075	metamorphoses	‘Why, as far as that is concerned, everything, unerringly, warned me not to give way to my desire, at the moment when the tablets fell, as I was giving orders for them to be taken to him, meaning that my hopes would also fall away
3076	metamorphoses	 Should not, perhaps, the day, or my whole intention, more so the day, have been altered? The god himself issued a warning, and gave a clear sign, if I had not been crazed with love
3077	metamorphoses	 Also I should have told him myself, and revealed my passion to him in person, and not committed myself in writing
3078	metamorphoses	 He would have seen the tears, and seen a lover’s face
3079	metamorphoses	 I could have said more than any letter can contain
3080	metamorphoses	 I could have thrown my arms around his unwilling neck, and if I had been rejected, I could have seemed on the point of dying, embraced his feet, and lying there begged for life
3081	metamorphoses	 I should have done all those things that, if not singly, all together, might have persuaded his stubborn mind
3082	metamorphoses	 Maybe the messenger who was sent was at fault: did not approach him properly, I think, or choose a suitable moment, or discover when he and the time were free
3083	metamorphoses	It has all harmed me
3084	metamorphoses	 Truly, my brother is not born of the tigress
3085	metamorphoses	 He does not have a heart of unyielding flint, solid iron, or steel
3086	metamorphoses	 He was not suckled on the milk of a lioness
3087	metamorphoses	 He will be won! I will try again, and not suffer any weariness in my attempts, while breath is left to me
3088	metamorphoses	 Since I cannot undo my actions, it would have been best not to begin: but, having begun, the next best is to win through
3089	metamorphoses	 In fact if I relinquished my longing, he could still not fail to remember what I have dared, and by desisting I will be seen to have been shallow in my desires, or to have been trying to tempt and snare him
3090	metamorphoses	 He will even believe, I am sure, that I have not been conquered by the god, who, above all, impels and inflames our hearts, but by lust
3091	metamorphoses	 In short, I cannot but be guilty of impiety, of writing, of wooing: my wishes are revealed
3092	metamorphoses	 Though I add nothing to them, I cannot be said to be innocent
3093	metamorphoses	 There is little left to be accused of, but much to long for
3094	metamorphoses	"’
"
3095	metamorphoses	So she argues, and (so great is the undecided conflict in her mind) while she repented of the attempt, she delights in attempting
3096	metamorphoses	 Going beyond all moderation, and unsuccessful in what she tries, she is endlessly rejected
3097	metamorphoses	 Finally, when there seems no end to it, he flees from this wickedness and from his home, and founds a new city in a foreign place: Caunus, in Caria
3098	metamorphoses	Then, indeed, grief made Miletus’s daughter lose her mind completely
3099	metamorphoses	 Then, indeed, she tore the clothes from her breast, and beat her arms in frenzy
3100	metamorphoses	 Her madness was now public, and she confessed her hope of illicit union, by leaving the country she hated, and her household gods, and following the footsteps of her fleeing brother
3101	metamorphoses	 The women of Bubasos saw Byblis, howling in the open fields, as your Thracians, son of Semele, pricked by your thyrsus, keep your triennial festival
3102	metamorphoses	Leaving them behind she wandered through Caria, through the lands of the armed Leleges, and on through Lycia
3103	metamorphoses	 Now she was beyond Lycian Cragus, and Limyre, and the waters of the Xanthian plain, and the ridge of Mount Chimaera near Phaleris, where the fire-breathing monster lived, joining a lion’s head and chest to a serpent’s tail
3104	metamorphoses	 Above the woods, when, wearied, you were weak from following, you fell, Byblis, your hair spread on the hard earth, and your face pressing the fallen leaves
3105	metamorphoses	The Lelegeian nymphs often try to lift her in their tender arms, and often they teach her how she might remedy her love, and they offer comfort to her silent heart
3106	metamorphoses	 She lies there, mute, clutching at the green stems with her fingers, and watering the grass with her flowing tears
3107	metamorphoses	 They say the naiads created a spring from them, beneath her, which could never run dry
3108	metamorphoses	 Well, what more could they offer her? There and then, Byblis, Phoebus’s granddaughter, consumed by her own tears, is changed into a fountain: just as drops of resin ooze from a cut pine, or sticky bitumen from heavy soil, or as water, that has been frozen by the cold, melts in the sun, at the coming of the west wind’s gentle breath: and even now in those valleys it retains its mistress’s name, and flows from underneath a dark holm oak
3109	metamorphoses	Perhaps, the story of this new marvel would have filled Crete’s hundred cities, if Crete had not recently known a miracle nearer home, in the metamorphosis of Iphis
3110	metamorphoses	 In the Phaestos region, near royal Cnossos, there once lived a man named Ligdus, undistinguished, a native of the place, his wealth no greater than his fame, but living a blameless and honourable life
3111	metamorphoses	 When his pregnant wife, Telethusa, was near to her time, he spoke these words of warning in her ear: ‘There are two things I wish for: that you are delivered with the least pain, and that you produce a male child
3112	metamorphoses	 A girl is a heavier burden, and misfortune denies them strength
3113	metamorphoses	 So, though I hate this, if, by chance, you give birth to a female infant, reluctantly, I order - let my impiety be forgiven! – that it be put to death
3114	metamorphoses	’ He spoke, and tears flooded their cheeks, he who commanded, and she to whom the command was given
3115	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless, Telethusa, urged her husband, with vain prayers, not to confine hope itself
3116	metamorphoses	 Ligdus remained fixed in his determination
3117	metamorphoses	Now, her pregnant belly could scarcely bear to carry her fully-grown burden, when Io, the daughter of Inachus, at midnight, in sleep’s imagining, stood, or seemed to stand, by her bed: Isis, accompanied by her holy procession
3118	metamorphoses	 The moon’s crescent horns were on her forehead, and the shining gold of yellow ears of corn, and royal splendour belonged to her
3119	metamorphoses	 With her were the jackal-headed Anubis, the hallowed cat-headed Bast, the dappled bull Apis, and Harpocrates, the god who holds his tongue, and urges silence, thumb in mouth
3120	metamorphoses	 The sacred rattle, the sistrum, was there; and Osiris, for whom her search never ends; and the strange serpent she fashioned, swollen with sleep-inducing venom, that poisoned the sun-god Ra
3121	metamorphoses	 Then, as if Telethusa had shaken off sleep, and was seeing clearly, the goddess spoke to her, saying: ‘O, you who belong to me, forget your heavy cares, and do not obey your husband
3122	metamorphoses	 When Lucina has eased the birth, whatever sex the child has, do not hesitate to raise it
3123	metamorphoses	 I am the goddess, who, when prevailed upon, brings help and strength: you will have no cause to complain, that the divinity, you worshipped, lacks gratitude
3124	metamorphoses	’ Having given her command, she left the room
3125	metamorphoses	 Joyfully, the Cretan woman rose, and, lifting her innocent hands to the stars, she prayed, in all humility, that her dream might prove true
3126	metamorphoses	When the pains grew, and her burden pushed its own way into the world, and a girl was born, the mother ordered it to be reared, deceitfully, as a boy, without the father realising
3127	metamorphoses	 She had all that she needed, and no one but the nurse knew of the fraud
3128	metamorphoses	 The father made good his vows, and gave it the name of the grandfather: he was Iphis
3129	metamorphoses	 The mother was delighted with the name, since it was appropriate for either gender, and no one was cheated by it
3130	metamorphoses	 From that moment, the deception, begun with a sacred lie, went undetected
3131	metamorphoses	 The child was dressed as a boy, and its features would have been beautiful whether they were given to a girl or a boy
3132	metamorphoses	Thirteen years passed by, meanwhile, and then, Iphis, your father betrothed you to golden-haired Ianthe, whose dowry was her beauty, the girl most praised amongst the women of Phaestos, the daughter of Telestes of Dicte
3133	metamorphoses	 The two were equal in age, and equal in looks, and had received their first instruction, in the knowledge of life, from the same teachers
3134	metamorphoses	 From this beginning, love had touched both their innocent hearts, and wounded them equally, but with unequal expectations
3135	metamorphoses	 Ianthe anticipated her wedding day, and the promised marriage, believing he, whom she thought to be a man, would be her man
3136	metamorphoses	 Iphis loved one whom she despaired of being able to have, and this itself increased her passion, a girl on fire for a girl
3137	metamorphoses	Hardly restraining her tears, she said ‘What way out is there left, for me, possessed by the pain of a strange and monstrous love, that no one ever knew before? If the gods wanted to spare me they should have spared me, but if they wanted to destroy me, they might at least have visited on me a natural, and normal, misfortune
3138	metamorphoses	 Mares do not burn with love for mares, or heifers for heifers: the ram inflames the ewe: its hind follows the stag
3139	metamorphoses	 So, birds mate, and among all animals, not one female is attacked by lust for a female
3140	metamorphoses	 I wish I were not one! Yet that Crete might not fail to bear every monstrosity, Pasiphaë, Sol’s daughter, loved a bull, though still that was a female and a male
3141	metamorphoses	 My love, truth be told, is more extreme than that
3142	metamorphoses	 She at least chased after the hope of fulfilment, though the bull had her because of her deceit, and in the likeness of a cow, and the one who was deceived was a male adulterer
3143	metamorphoses	" Though all of the world’s cleverness were concentrated here, though Daedalus were to return on waxen wings, what use would it be? Surely even his cunning arts could not make a boy out of a girl? Surely even he could not transform you, Ianthe?
"
3144	metamorphoses	Rather be firm-minded, Iphis, and pull yourself together, and, with wisdom, shake off this foolish, useless passion
3145	metamorphoses	 Look at what you have been, from birth, if you don’t want to cheat yourself, and seek out what is right for you, and love as a woman should! It is hope that creates love, and hope that nourishes it
3146	metamorphoses	 Everything robs you of that
3147	metamorphoses	 No guardian keeps you from her dear arms, no wary husband’s care, no cruel father, nor does she deny your wooing herself
3148	metamorphoses	 Yet you can never have her, or be happy, whatever is accomplished, whatever men or gods attempt
3149	metamorphoses	Even now, no part of my prayers has been denied
3150	metamorphoses	 The gods have readily given whatever they were able, and my father, her father, and she herself, want what I want to happen
3151	metamorphoses	 But Nature does not want it, the only one who harms me, more powerful than them all
3152	metamorphoses	 See, the longed-for time has come, the wedding torch is at hand, and Ianthe will become mine – yet not be had by me
3153	metamorphoses	 I will thirst in the midst of the waters
3154	metamorphoses	" Juno, goddess of brides, and Hymen, why do you come to these marriage rites, where the bridegroom is absent, and both are brides?’
"
3155	metamorphoses	With these words, she stopped speaking
3156	metamorphoses	 The other girl was no less on fire, and prayed, Hymen, that you would come quickly
3157	metamorphoses	 Telethusa, afraid of what she sought, merely put off the day: now lengthening the delay through pretended illness, now, frequently, using omens and dreams as an excuse
3158	metamorphoses	 But eventually every pretext was exhausted, the date for the delayed marriage ceremony was set, and only a day remained
3159	metamorphoses	 Then Telethusa took the sacred ribbons from her own and her daughter Iphis’s head, so that their hair streamed down, and clinging to the altar, cried: ‘Isis, you who protect Paraetonium, Pharos, the Mareotic fields, and Nile, divided in its seven streams, I pray you, bring help, and relieve our fears! Goddess, I saw you once, you, and those symbols of you, and I knew them all, accompanied by the jingling bronze of the sistrum, and imprinted your commands on my remembering mind
3160	metamorphoses	 That my daughter looks on the light, that I have not been punished, behold, it was your purpose, and your gift
3161	metamorphoses	 Gladden us with your aid
3162	metamorphoses	" Have pity on us both!’
"
3163	metamorphoses	Tears followed words
3164	metamorphoses	 The goddess seemed to make the altar tremble (it did tremble), and the doors of the temple shook, her horns, shaped like the moon’s crescents, shone, and the sistrum rattled loudly
3165	metamorphoses	 Not yet reassured, but gladdened by the auspicious omen, the mother left the temple
3166	metamorphoses	 Iphis, her companion, followed, taking larger paces than before; with no whiteness left in her complexion; with additional strength, and sharper features, and shorter, less elegant hair; showing more vigour than women have
3167	metamorphoses	" Take your gifts to the temple, Iphis: rejoice, with confidence, not fear! You, who were lately a girl, are now a boy!
"
3168	metamorphoses	"They take their gifts to the temple, and add a votive tablet: the tablet has this brief line:
"
3169	metamorphoses	IPHIS PERFORMS AS A BOY, WHAT HE PROMISED, AS A GIRL
3170	metamorphoses	 The next day’s sun reveals the wide world in its rays, when Venus, and Juno, joined with Hymen, come, to the marriage torches, and Iphis, the boy, gains possession of his Ianthe
3171	metamorphoses	Hymen, called by the voice of Orpheus, departed, and, dressed in his saffron robes, made his way through the vast skies to the Ciconian coast: but in vain
3172	metamorphoses	 He was present at Orpheus’s marriage, true, but he did not speak the usual words, display a joyful expression, or bring good luck
3173	metamorphoses	 The torch, too, that he held, sputtered continually, with tear-provoking fumes, and no amount of shaking contrived to light it properly
3174	metamorphoses	 The result was worse than any omens
3175	metamorphoses	 While the newly wedded bride, Eurydice, was walking through the grass, with a crowd of naiads as her companions, she was killed, by a bite on her ankle, from a snake, sheltering there
3176	metamorphoses	 When Thracian Orpheus, the poet of Rhodope, had mourned for her, greatly, in the upper world, he dared to go down to Styx, through the gate of Taenarus, also, to see if he might not move the dead
3177	metamorphoses	Through the weightless throng, and the ghosts that had received proper burial, he came to Persephone, and the lord of the shadows, he who rules the joyless kingdom
3178	metamorphoses	 Then striking the lyre-strings to accompany his words, he sang: ‘O gods of this world, placed below the earth, to which all, who are created mortal, descend; if you allow me, and it is lawful, to set aside the fictions of idle tongues and speak the truth, I have not come here to see dark Tartarus, nor to bind Cerberus, Medusa’s child, with his three necks, and snaky hair
3179	metamorphoses	 My wife is the cause of my journey
3180	metamorphoses	 A viper she trod on diffused its venom into her body, and robbed her of her best years
3181	metamorphoses	 I longed to be able to accept it, and I do not say I have not tried: Love won
3182	metamorphoses	He is a god well known in the world above, though I do not know if it is so here: though I do imagine him to be here, as well, and if the story of that rape in ancient times is not a lie, you also were wedded by Amor
3183	metamorphoses	 I beg you, by these fearful places, by this immense abyss, and the silence of your vast realms, reverse Eurydice’s swift death
3184	metamorphoses	 All things are destined to be yours, and though we delay a while, sooner or later we hasten home
3185	metamorphoses	 Here we are all bound, this is our final abode, and you hold the longest reign over the human race
3186	metamorphoses	 Eurydice, too, will be yours to command, when she has lived out her fair span of years, to maturity
3187	metamorphoses	 I ask this benefit as a gift; but, if the fates refuse my wife this kindness, I am determined not to return: you can delight in both our deaths
3188	metamorphoses	"’
"
3189	metamorphoses	The bloodless spirits wept as he spoke, accompanying his words with the music
3190	metamorphoses	 Tantalus did not reach for the ever-retreating water: Ixion’s wheel was stilled: the vultures did not pluck at Tityus’s liver: the Belides, the daughters of Danaüs, left their water jars: and you, Sisyphus, perched there, on your rock
3191	metamorphoses	 Then they say, for the first time, the faces of the Furies were wet with tears, won over by his song: the king of the deep, and his royal bride, could not bear to refuse his prayer, and called for Eurydice
3192	metamorphoses	She was among the recent ghosts, and walked haltingly from her wound
3193	metamorphoses	 The poet of Rhodope received her, and, at the same time, accepted this condition, that he must not turn his eyes behind him, until he emerged from the vale of Avernus, or the gift would be null and void
3194	metamorphoses	They took the upward path, through the still silence, steep and dark, shadowy with dense fog, drawing near to the threshold of the upper world
3195	metamorphoses	 Afraid she was no longer there, and eager to see her, the lover turned his eyes
3196	metamorphoses	 In an instant she dropped back, and he, unhappy man, stretching out his arms to hold her and be held, clutched at nothing but the receding air
3197	metamorphoses	 Dying a second time, now, there was no complaint to her husband (what, then, could she complain of, except that she had been loved?)
3198	metamorphoses	 She spoke a last ‘farewell’ that, now, scarcely reached his ears, and turned again towards that same place
3199	metamorphoses	Stunned by the double loss of his wife, Orpheus was like that coward who saw Cerberus, the three-headed dog, chained by the central neck, and whose fear vanished with his nature, as stone transformed his body
3200	metamorphoses	 Or like Olenos, and you, his Lethaea, too proud of your beauty: he wished to be charged with your crime, and seem guilty himself: once wedded hearts, you are now rocks set on moist Mount Ida
3201	metamorphoses	Orpheus wished and prayed, in vain, to cross the Styx again, but the ferryman fended him off
3202	metamorphoses	 Still, for seven days, he sat there by the shore, neglecting himself and not taking nourishment
3203	metamorphoses	 Sorrow, troubled thought, and tears were his food
3204	metamorphoses	 He took himself to lofty Mount Rhodope, and Haemus, swept by the winds, complaining that the gods of Erebus were cruel
3205	metamorphoses	Three times the sun had ended the year, in watery Pisces, and Orpheus had abstained from the love of women, either because things ended badly for him, or because he had sworn to do so
3206	metamorphoses	 Yet, many felt a desire to be joined with the poet, and many grieved at rejection
3207	metamorphoses	 Indeed, he was the first of the Thracian people to transfer his love to young boys, and enjoy their brief springtime, and early flowering, this side of manhood
3208	metamorphoses	There was a hill, and, on the hill, a wide area of level ground, turfed with fresh blades of grass: shade was absent there: but when the poet, born of the god, sounded the strings of his lyre, shade gathered there
3209	metamorphoses	 Jupiter’s Chaonian oak-tree came; and Phaethon’s sisters, the Heliades, the poplars; the durmast oak with its deep foliage; the soft lime-tree; the beech; the virgin sweet-bay, laurel; the hazel, frail; the ash-tree, used for spears; the sweeping silver-fir: holm-oak, heavy with acorns; pleasant plane-tree; the many-coloured maple; with the river-haunting willow; lotus, water-lover; boxwood ever-verdant; the slender tamarisk; the myrtle, with, over and under its leaves, the two shades of green; and the blue-berried wild-bay, laurus tinus
3210	metamorphoses	 You came, also, twining ivy, together with shooting vines; the vine-supporting elms; the flowering ‘manna’ ash; the spruce; the strawberry tree, weighed down with its red fruit; the pliant palms, the winner’s prize; and you, the shaggy-topped pine tree, armed with needles, sacred to Cybele, mother of the gods, since Attis exchanged his human form for you, and hardened in your trunk
3211	metamorphoses	Among the crowd came the cypress, formed like the cone-shaped meta, that marks the turning point in the race-course: once a boy, but now a tree: loved by the god who tunes the lyre, and strings the bow
3212	metamorphoses	There was a giant stag, sacred to the nymphs that haunt the Carthaean country, which cast deep shadows, around its head, from his wide-branching antlers
3213	metamorphoses	 The antlers shone with gold, and the gems of a jewelled collar, around his polished neck, hung down onto his shoulders
3214	metamorphoses	 A bulla, a silver charm, fastened with small strips of leather, quivered on his forehead, and on either side of his hollow temples matching pearls of bronze gleamed from both ears
3215	metamorphoses	 Free from fear, and forgetting his natural shyness, he used to visit people’s houses, and offer his neck to be stroked by strangers’ hands
3216	metamorphoses	 Yet, above all others, he was dear to you, Cyparissus, loveliest of the Cean boys
3217	metamorphoses	 You led the stag to fresh pastures, and the waters of the clear spring
3218	metamorphoses	 Now you would weave diverse flowers through his horns, and then, astride his back like a horseman, delight in tugging his soft mouth one way or the other by means of a purple muzzle
3219	metamorphoses	It was noon of a summer’s day, when the curving claws of shore-loving Cancer were burning in the hot sun
3220	metamorphoses	 Tired, the stag had settled its body on the grassy turf and was enjoying the cool of the woodland shade
3221	metamorphoses	 The boy, without intention, transfixed it with his sharp spear, and when he saw it dying from the cruel wound, he wished to die himself
3222	metamorphoses	 What was there Phoebus did not say, in solace, advising a moderate grief matching the cause! He only sighed, and begged, as the last gift of the gods, that he might mourn forever
3223	metamorphoses	 Then, his blood discharged among endless tears, his limbs began to turn to a shade of green, and his hair that a moment ago hung over his pale forehead, became a bristling crown, and he stiffened to a graceful point gazing at the starry heavens
3224	metamorphoses	 The god sighed for him, and said, sadly: ‘I will mourn for you: you will mourn for others, and enter into sorrows’
3225	metamorphoses	Such was the grove of trees the poet gathered round him, and he sat in the midst of a crowd, of animals and birds
3226	metamorphoses	 When he had tried a few chords, stroking the lyre with his thumb, and felt that the various notes were in tune, regardless of their pitch, he raised his voice to sing: ‘Begin my song with Jupiter, Calliope, O Muse, my mother (all things bow to Jupiter’s might)! I have often sung the power of Jove before: I have sung of the Giants, in an epic strain, and the victorious lightning bolts, hurled at the Phlegraean field
3227	metamorphoses	 Now there is gentler work for the lyre, and I sing of boys loved by the gods, and girls stricken with forbidden fires, deserving punishment for their lust
3228	metamorphoses	The king of the gods once burned with love for Phrygian Ganymede, and to win him Jupiter chose to be something other than he was
3229	metamorphoses	 Yet he did not deign to transform himself into any other bird, than that eagle, that could carry his lightning bolts
3230	metamorphoses	 Straightaway, he beat the air with deceitful wings, and stole the Trojan boy, who still handles the mixing cups, and against Juno’s will pours out Jove’s nectar
3231	metamorphoses	You too, Hyacinthus, of Amyclae, Phoebus would have placed in heaven, if sad fate had given him time to do so
3232	metamorphoses	 Still, as it is, you are immortal, and whenever spring drives winter away, and Aries follows watery Pisces, you also rise, and flower in the green turf
3233	metamorphoses	 My father, Phoebus, loved you above all others: and Delphi, at the centre of the world, lost its presiding deity, while the god frequented Eurotas, and Sparta without its walls, doing no honour to the zither or the bow
3234	metamorphoses	 Forgetting his usual pursuits, he did not object to carrying the nets, handling the dogs, or travelling as a companion, over the rough mountain ridges, and by constant partnership feeding the flames
3235	metamorphoses	Now, the sun was midway between the vanished and the future night, equally far from either extreme: they stripped off their clothes, and gleaming with the rich olive oil, they had rubbed themselves with, they began a contest with the broad discus
3236	metamorphoses	 Phoebus went first, balancing it, and hurling it high into the air, scattering the clouds with its weight
3237	metamorphoses	 Its mass took a long time to fall back to the hard ground, showing strength and skill combined
3238	metamorphoses	 Immediately the Taenarian boy, without thinking, ran forward to pick up the disc, prompted by his eagerness to throw, but the solid earth threw it back, hitting you in the face, with the rebound, Hyacinthus
3239	metamorphoses	The god is as white as the boy, and cradles the fallen body
3240	metamorphoses	 Now he tries to revive you, now to staunch your dreadful wound, and now applies herbs to hold back your departing spirit
3241	metamorphoses	 His arts are useless: the wound is incurable
3242	metamorphoses	 Just as if, when someone, in a garden, breaks violets, stiff poppies, or the lilies with their bristling yellow stamens, and, suddenly, they droop, bowing their weakened heads, unable to support themselves, and their tops gaze at the soil: so his dying head drops, and, with failing strength, the neck is overburdened, and sinks onto the shoulder
3243	metamorphoses	‘You slip away, Spartan, robbed of the flower of youth’ Phoebus sighed, ‘and I see my guilt, in your wound
3244	metamorphoses	 You are my grief and my reproach: your death must be ascribed to my hand
3245	metamorphoses	 I am the agent of your destruction
3246	metamorphoses	 Yet, how was it my fault, unless taking part in a game can be called a fault, unless it can be called a fault to have loved you? If only I might die with you, and pay with my life! But since the laws of fate bind us, you shall always be with me, and cling to my remembering lips
3247	metamorphoses	 My songs; the lyre my hand touches; will celebrate you
3248	metamorphoses	 As a new-formed flower, you shall denote my woe, by your markings
3249	metamorphoses	 And the time will come, when Ajax, bravest of heroes, will associate himself with this same flower, and be identified by its petals
3250	metamorphoses	While the truthful mouth of Apollo uttered these words, look, the blood that had spilt on the ground staining the grass was no longer blood, and a flower sprang up, brighter than Tyrian dye, and took the shape of a lily, though it was purple in colour, where the other is silvery white
3251	metamorphoses	 Not satisfied with this alone, Phoebus (he, indeed, was the giver of the honour) himself marked his grief on the petals, and the flower bore the letters AI AI, the letters of woe traced there
3252	metamorphoses	 Nor was Sparta ashamed of producing Hyacinthus: his honour has lasted to this day, and by ancient custom the Hyacinthia is celebrated, at its annual return, by displaying the flower in procession
3253	metamorphoses	"’
"
3254	metamorphoses	‘But if you should ask the Cyprian city of Amathus, rich in mines, whether it would have wished to have produced those girls, the Propoetides, it would repudiate them, and equally those men, whose foreheads were once marred by two horns, from which they took their name, Cerastae
3255	metamorphoses	 An altar, to Jove the Hospitable, used to stand in front of the gates: if any stranger, ignorant of their wickedness, had seen it, stained with blood, they would have thought that calves or sheep, from Amathus, were sacrificed there: it was their guests they killed! Kindly Venus was preparing to abandon her cities, and the Cyprian fields, outraged by their abominable rites, but ‘How,’ she said, ‘have my cities, or this dear place, sinned? What is their crime? Instead, let this impious race pay the penalty of death or exile, or some punishment between execution and banishment, and what might that be but the penalty of being transformed?’ While she is deciding how to alter them, she turns her eyes towards their horns, and this suggests that she might leave them those, and she changed them into wild bullocks
3256	metamorphoses	Nevertheless, the immoral Propoetides dared to deny that Venus was the goddess
3257	metamorphoses	 For this, because of her divine anger, they are said to have been the first to prostitute their bodies and their reputations in public, and, losing all sense of shame, they lost the power to blush, as the blood hardened in their cheeks, and only a small change turned them into hard flints
3258	metamorphoses	"’
"
3259	metamorphoses	‘Pygmalion had seen them, spending their lives in wickedness, and, offended by the failings that nature gave the female heart, he lived as a bachelor, without a wife or partner for his bed
3260	metamorphoses	 But, with wonderful skill, he carved a figure, brilliantly, out of snow-white ivory, no mortal woman, and fell in love with his own creation
3261	metamorphoses	 The features are those of a real girl, who, you might think, lived, and wished to move, if modesty did not forbid it
3262	metamorphoses	 Indeed, art hides his art
3263	metamorphoses	 He marvels: and passion, for this bodily image, consumes his heart
3264	metamorphoses	 Often, he runs his hands over the work, tempted as to whether it is flesh or ivory, not admitting it to be ivory
3265	metamorphoses	 He kisses it and thinks his kisses are returned; and speaks to it; and holds it, and imagines that his fingers press into the limbs, and is afraid lest bruises appear from the pressure
3266	metamorphoses	 Now he addresses it with compliments, now brings it gifts that please girls, shells and polished pebbles, little birds, and many-coloured flowers, lilies and tinted beads, and the Heliades’s amber tears, that drip from the trees
3267	metamorphoses	 He dresses the body, also, in clothing; places rings on the fingers; places a long necklace round its neck; pearls hang from the ears, and cinctures round the breasts
3268	metamorphoses	 All are fitting: but it appears no less lovely, naked
3269	metamorphoses	 He arranges the statue on a bed on which cloths dyed with Tyrian murex are spread, and calls it his bedfellow, and rests its neck against soft down, as if it could feel
3270	metamorphoses	The day of Venus’s festival came, celebrated throughout Cyprus, and heifers, their curved horns gilded, fell, to the blow on their snowy neck
3271	metamorphoses	 The incense was smoking, when Pygmalion, having made his offering, stood by the altar, and said, shyly: “If you can grant all things, you gods, I wish as a bride to have
3272	metamorphoses	” and not daring to say “the girl of ivory” he said “one like my ivory girl
3273	metamorphoses	” Golden Venus, for she herself was present at the festival, knew what the prayer meant, and as a sign of the gods’ fondness for him, the flame flared three times, and shook its crown in the air
3274	metamorphoses	 When he returned, he sought out the image of his girl, and leaning over the couch, kissed her
3275	metamorphoses	 She felt warm: he pressed his lips to her again, and also touched her breast with his hand
3276	metamorphoses	 The ivory yielded to his touch, and lost its hardness, altering under his fingers, as the bees’ wax of Hymettus softens in the sun, and is moulded, under the thumb, into many forms, made usable by use
3277	metamorphoses	 The lover is stupefied, and joyful, but uncertain, and afraid he is wrong, reaffirms the fulfilment of his wishes, with his hand, again, and again
3278	metamorphoses	It was flesh! The pulse throbbed under his thumb
3279	metamorphoses	 Then the hero, of Paphos, was indeed overfull of words with which to thank Venus, and still pressed his mouth against a mouth that was not merely a likeness
3280	metamorphoses	 The girl felt the kisses he gave, blushed, and, raising her bashful eyes to the light, saw both her lover and the sky
3281	metamorphoses	 The goddess attended the marriage that she had brought about, and when the moon’s horns had nine times met at the full, the woman bore a son, Paphos, from whom the island takes its name
3282	metamorphoses	"’
"
3283	metamorphoses	‘Cinyras was the son of Paphos, and he might have been counted amongst the fortunate, if he, in turn, had been childless
3284	metamorphoses	 I speak of terrible things
3285	metamorphoses	 Fathers and daughters, keep away: or if your mind takes pleasure in my song, put no faith in this story of mine, and imagine it did not happen
3286	metamorphoses	 Or, if you do believe it, believe in the punishment also, that it brought
3287	metamorphoses	 If nature, however, allows such crimes to be visible, then I give thanks that the people of Thrace, this city, and this land, are far from the regions where such sin is born
3288	metamorphoses	 Let the land of Panchaia, beyond Araby, produce its balsam, cinnamon, costmary; its incense, exuded from the trees; its flowers different from ours; if it produces myrrh: a strange tree is not worth such a price
3289	metamorphoses	Cupid denies that his arrows hurt you, Myrrha, and clears his fires of blame for your crime
3290	metamorphoses	 One of the three sisters, the Furies, with her swollen snakes, and firebrand from the Styx, breathed on you
3291	metamorphoses	 It is wrong to hate your father, but that love was a greater wrong than hatred
3292	metamorphoses	 The pick of the princes, from everywhere, desire you: young men, from the whole of the East, come to win you in marriage
3293	metamorphoses	 Out of the many, choose one for your husband, Myrrha, but let one man not be amongst the many
3294	metamorphoses	Indeed, she knows it, and fights against her disgraceful passion, and says, to herself: “Where is my thought leading? What am I creating? You gods, I pray, and the duty and sacred laws respecting parents, prevent this wickedness, and oppose my sin, indeed, if sin it is
3295	metamorphoses	 But it can be said that duty declines to condemn such love
3296	metamorphoses	 Other creatures mate indiscriminately: it is no disgrace for a heifer to have her sire mount her, for his filly to be a stallion’s mate: the goat goes with the flocks he has made, and the birds themselves conceive, by him whose seed conceived them
3297	metamorphoses	 Happy the creatures who are allowed to do so! Human concern has made malign laws, and what nature allows, jealous duty forbids
3298	metamorphoses	Yet they say there are races where mother and son, and father and daughter, pair off, and affection is increased by a double bond
3299	metamorphoses	 Alas for me, that I did not happen to be born there, and that I am made to suffer by an accident of place! – Why do I repeat these things? Forbidden hopes, vanish! He is worth loving, but only as a father
3300	metamorphoses	 – I could lie with Cinyras, if I were not Cinyras’s already
3301	metamorphoses	 Now, he is not mine, because he is already mine, and the nearness of our relationship damns me: I would be better off as a stranger
3302	metamorphoses	 I would be happy to go far away, and leave the borders of my homeland behind me, if I might run from evil: but even if nothing more is permitted, a wicked desire to see Cinyras, touch him, speak to him, and kiss him, face to face, prevents my leaving
3303	metamorphoses	 But then, what more might you look to have, impious girl? Do you realise how many names and ties you are throwing into confusion? Would you be, then, your mother’s rival, and your father’s mistress? Would you be known, then, as your son’s sister, your brother’s mother? Do you not fear the three sisters, with black snaky hair, that those with guilty hearts, their eyes and mouths attacked with cruel torches, see? Since you have still not committed sin in the flesh, do not conceive it in your mind, or disregard the prohibitions of mighty nature, in vile congress! Grant that you want it: the reality itself forbids it
3304	metamorphoses	" He is a good man, and mindful of the moral law – but, O, how I wish the same passion were in him!” ’
"
3305	metamorphoses	‘She spoke: Cinyras, however, who was made doubtful of what to do by the crowd of noble suitors, naming them, asked her whom she wanted, as a husband
3306	metamorphoses	At first she is silent, and staring at her father’s face, hesitates, her eyes filling with warm tears
3307	metamorphoses	 Cinyras thinking this to be virgin shyness, forbids her to cry, dries her cheeks, and kisses her on the lips
3308	metamorphoses	 Myrrha is overjoyed at this gift, and, being consulted as to what kind of husband she might choose, says: “Someone like you”
3309	metamorphoses	 Not understanding this, however, he praises her, saying: “Always be so loving
3310	metamorphoses	” At the word “loving”, the girl, lowers her glance, conscious of her sin
3311	metamorphoses	It was midnight, and sleep had released mortal flesh from worldly cares, but Cinyras’s daughter, wakeful, stirring the embers, reawakens her ungovernable desires, one moment despairing, at another willing to try, ashamed and eager, not yet discovering what to do
3312	metamorphoses	 As a tall tree, struck by the axe, the last blow remaining, uncertain how it will fall, causes fear on all sides, so her fickle mind, swayed this way and that, her thought taking both directions, seeing no rest for or end to her passion, but death
3313	metamorphoses	 She felt ready to die
3314	metamorphoses	 She got up, determined, to fix a noose round her throat, and, fastening a cord to the doorway’s crossbeam, she said: “Goodbye, dear Cinyras, and realize the reason for my death!” And she tied the rope around her bloodless neck
3315	metamorphoses	 They say that the murmured words came to the ears of her loyal nurse, who watched at her foster-child’s threshold
3316	metamorphoses	The old woman gets up, and opens the door, and, seeing the equipment of death, cries out, and in the same moment, strikes her breast, snatches at the folds of her robe, and tearing the noose from the girl’s neck, pulls it apart
3317	metamorphoses	 Then, finally, she has time to cry, to embrace her, and demand the reason for the rope
3318	metamorphoses	 The girl is mute and still, looking, fixedly, at the ground, and unhappy that her belated attempt at death has been discovered
3319	metamorphoses	 The old woman insists on knowing, baring her white hair and withered breasts, and begs her to say what grieves her, invoking her infant cradle, and first nurturing
3320	metamorphoses	" 
"
3321	metamorphoses	The girl turns away from her pleading, with a sigh
3322	metamorphoses	 The nurse is determined to know, and promises more than loyalty
3323	metamorphoses	 “Tell me,” She says, “and let me bring you some help: age does not slow me
3324	metamorphoses	 If it is some frenzy, I have herbs and charms that heal: if someone is seeking your harm, I will purify you with magic rites: if the gods are angry, anger is appeased by sacrifice
3325	metamorphoses	 What else could it be? The destiny of your house is fortunate, and on course: they are well, your mother and father
3326	metamorphoses	"”
"
3327	metamorphoses	Hearing the word “father”, Myrrha sighed deeply
3328	metamorphoses	 Even then the nurse had no idea of the sin in her mind, though she guessed it might be some love affair
3329	metamorphoses	 She begged her, tenaciously, to tell her what it was, and took the weeping girl to her aged breast, and holding her with trembling arms she said: “I know, you are in love! And in this matter (have no fear) my diligence can serve you, your father will never know
3330	metamorphoses	” The frenzied girl leapt from her arms, and burying her face in the bed, said, urgently: “Go, I beg you, and forgo the knowledge of my wretched shame! Go, or stop asking why I am grieving
3331	metamorphoses	 What you are striving to know, is wickedness
3332	metamorphoses	” The old woman shuddered, and stretching out her hands that trembled with age and fear, she fell at her foster-child’s feet, pleading, then coaxing, then frightening her, into making her party to it
3333	metamorphoses	 She threatens her with the evidence of the noose, and the attempt on her life, and promises her help in her love affair
3334	metamorphoses	 The girl raises her head, and her welling tears rain on her nurse’s breast
3335	metamorphoses	 She often tries to confess, and often stops herself, and hides her face, in shame, in her clothing: then gets as far as “Mother, you are happy in your husband!” and sighs
3336	metamorphoses	A shudder of cold penetrated the nurse’s flesh and bone (now she understood) and her white hair stiffened all over her head
3337	metamorphoses	 She told her at length, to banish, if she could, this fatal passion
3338	metamorphoses	 Though the girl knew she was being advised rightly, she was still determined to die, if she could not possess her love
3339	metamorphoses	 “Live,” said the nurse, “possess your
3340	metamorphoses	” - and did not dare say: “father”
3341	metamorphoses	 She was silent, and confirmed her promise in the sight of heaven
3342	metamorphoses	"’
"
3343	metamorphoses	‘The married women were celebrating that annual festival of Ceres, when, with their bodies veiled in white robes, they offer the first fruits of the harvest, wreathes of corn, and, for nine nights, treat sexual union, and the touch of a man, as forbidden
3344	metamorphoses	 Cenchreis, the king’s wife was among the crowd, frequenting the sacred rites
3345	metamorphoses	 Finding Cinyras drunk with wine, the king’s bed empty of his lawful partner, the nurse, wrongly diligent, told him of one who truly loved him, giving him a fictitious name, and praised her beauty
3346	metamorphoses	 He, asking the girl’s age, she said: “Myrrha’s is the same
3347	metamorphoses	” After she had been ordered to bring her, and had reached home, she said: “Be happy, my child, we have won!” The unhappy girl felt no joy at all in her heart, and her heart prophetically mourned, yet she was still glad: such was her confusion of mind
3348	metamorphoses	It was the hour, when all is silent, and Boötes, between the Bears, had turned his wagon, with downward-pointing shaft: she approached the sinful act
3349	metamorphoses	 The golden moon fled the sky; black clouds covered the hidden stars; night lacked its fires
3350	metamorphoses	 You, Icarius, and you, Erigone, his daughter, immortalised for your pious love of your father, hid your faces first
3351	metamorphoses	 Myrrha was checked by an omen, three times, when her foot stumbled: three times, the gloomy screech owl gave her warning, with its fatal cry: she still went on, her shame made less by blindness and black night
3352	metamorphoses	 With her left hand, she kept tight hold of her nurse, groping with the other she found a way through the dark
3353	metamorphoses	Now she reaches the threshold of the room, now she opens the door, now is led inside
3354	metamorphoses	 But her trembling knees give way, her colour flees with her blood, and thought vanishes as she goes forward
3355	metamorphoses	 The closer she is to her sin, the more she shudders at it, repents of her audacity, and wants to be able to turn back, unrecognised
3356	metamorphoses	 When she hesitated, the old woman took her by the hand, and, leading her to the high bed, delivered her up, saying: “Take her Cinyras, she is yours”, uniting their accursed flesh
3357	metamorphoses	 The father admitted his own child into the incestuous bed, calmed her virgin fears, and encouraged her timidity
3358	metamorphoses	 Perhaps he also said the name, “daughter”, in accordance with her age, and she said, “father”, so that their names were not absent from their sin
3359	metamorphoses	She left the room impregnated by her father, bearing impious seed in her fatal womb, carrying the guilt she had conceived
3360	metamorphoses	 The next night the crime was repeated: nor did it finish there
3361	metamorphoses	 Eventually, Cinyras, eager to discover his lover after so many couplings, fetching a light, saw his daughter and his guilt, and speechless from grief, he snatched his bright sword out of the sheath it hung in
3362	metamorphoses	 Myrrha ran, escaping death, by the gift of darkness and secret night
3363	metamorphoses	 Wandering the wide fields, she left the land of Panchaea, and palm-bearing Arabia, behind, and after roaming through nine returns of the crescent moon, weary, she rested at last in the land of the Sabaeans
3364	metamorphoses	Now she could scarcely bear the weight of her womb
3365	metamorphoses	 Tired of living, and scared of dying, not knowing what to pray for, she composed these words of entreaty: “O, if there are any gods who hear my prayer, I do not plead against my well deserved punishment, but lest, by being, I offend the living, or, by dying, offend the dead, banish me from both realms, and change me, and deny me life and death!” Some god listened to her prayer: certainly the last request found its path to the heavens
3366	metamorphoses	 While she was still speaking, the soil covered her shins; roots, breaking from her toes, spread sideways, supporting a tall trunk; her bones strengthened, and in the midst of the remaining marrow, the blood became sap; her arms became long branches; her fingers, twigs; her skin, solid bark
3367	metamorphoses	 And now the growing tree had drawn together over her ponderous belly, buried her breasts, and was beginning to encase her neck: she could not bear the wait, and she sank down against the wood, to meet it, and plunged her face into the bark
3368	metamorphoses	Though she has lost her former senses with her body, she still weeps, and the warm drops trickle down from the tree
3369	metamorphoses	 There is merit, also, in the tears: and the myrrh that drips from the bark keeps its mistress’s name, and, about it, no age will be silent
3370	metamorphoses	"’
"
3371	metamorphoses	‘The child, conceived in sin, had grown within the tree, and was now searching for a way to leave its mother, and reveal itself
3372	metamorphoses	 The pregnant womb swells within the tree trunk, the burden stretching the mother
3373	metamorphoses	 The pain cannot form words, nor can Lucina be called on, in the voice of a woman in labour
3374	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless the tree bends, like one straining, and groans constantly, and is wet with falling tears
3375	metamorphoses	 Gentle Lucina stood by the suffering branches, and laid her hands on them, speaking words that aid childbirth
3376	metamorphoses	 At this the tree split open, and, from the torn bark, gave up its living burden, and the child cried
3377	metamorphoses	 The naiads laid him on the soft grass, and anointed him with his mother’s tears
3378	metamorphoses	 Even Envy would praise his beauty, being so like one of the torsos of naked Amor painted on boards
3379	metamorphoses	 But to stop them differing in attributes, you must add a light quiver, for him, or take theirs away from them
3380	metamorphoses	Transient time slips by us unnoticed, betrays us, and nothing outpaces the years
3381	metamorphoses	 That son of his grandfather, sister, now hid in a tree, and now born, then a most beautiful child, then a boy, now a man, now more beautiful than he was before, now interests Venus herself, and avenges his mother’s desire
3382	metamorphoses	 For while the boy, Cupid, with quiver on shoulder, was kissing his mother, he innocently scratched her breast with a loose arrow
3383	metamorphoses	 The injured goddess pushed her son away: but the wound he had given was deeper than it seemed, and deceived her at first
3384	metamorphoses	 Now captured by mortal beauty, she cares no more for Cythera’s shores, nor revisits Paphos, surrounded by its deep waters, nor Cnidos, the haunt of fish, nor Amathus, rich in mines: she even forgoes the heavens: preferring Adonis to heaven
3385	metamorphoses	She holds him, and is his companion, and though she is used to always idling in the shade, and, by cultivating it, enhancing her beauty, she roams mountain ridges, and forests, and thorny cliff-sides, her clothing caught up to the knee, like Diana
3386	metamorphoses	 And she cheers on the hounds, chasing things safe to hunt, hares flying headlong, stags with deep horns, or their hinds
3387	metamorphoses	 She avoids the strong wild boars, the ravening wolves, and shuns the bears armed with claws, and the lions glutted with the slaughter of cattle
3388	metamorphoses	 She warns you Adonis, as if it were ever effective to warn, to fear them too, saying: “Be bold when they run, but bravery is unsafe when faced with the brave
3389	metamorphoses	 Do not be foolish, beware of endangering me, and do not provoke the creatures nature has armed, lest your glory is to my great cost
3390	metamorphoses	 Neither youth nor beauty, nor the charms that affect Venus, affect lions or bristling boars or the eyes and minds of other wild creatures
3391	metamorphoses	 Boars have the force of a fierce lightning bolt in their curving tusks, and so does the attack of tawny lions, in their huge anger: the whole tribe are hateful to me
3392	metamorphoses	"”
"
3393	metamorphoses	When he asks her why, she says: “I will tell, and you will wonder, at the monstrous result of an ancient crime
3394	metamorphoses	 But now the unaccustomed effort tires me, and, look, a poplar tree entices us with its welcome shade, and the turf yields a bed
3395	metamorphoses	 I should like to rest here on the ground,” (and she rested) “with you
3396	metamorphoses	"” She hugged the grass, and him, and leaning her head against the breast of the reclining youth, she spoke these words, interspersing them with kisses:’
"
3397	metamorphoses	‘ “Perhaps you have heard of a girl who beat the fastest men at running: that was no idle tale, she did win
3398	metamorphoses	 Nor could you say whether her speed or her beauty was more deserving of high praise
3399	metamorphoses	 Enquiring of the god, about a husband, the god replied: ‘You don’t need a husband, Atalanta: run from the necessity for a husband
3400	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless, you will not escape, and, still living, you will not be yourself
3401	metamorphoses	’ Afraid of the god’s oracle, she lived in the dark forests, unmarried, and fled from the crowd of insistent suitors, setting harsh conditions: ‘I will not be won, till I am beaten in running
3402	metamorphoses	 Compete in the foot-race with me
3403	metamorphoses	 Wife and bed will be given as prizes to the swift, death to the tardy: let those be the rules
3404	metamorphoses	"’
"
3405	metamorphoses	Truly she was pitiless, but (such was the power of her beauty) a rash crowd of suitors came, despite the rules
3406	metamorphoses	 Hippomenes had taken his seat as a spectator at the unjust contest, and said ‘Who would try for a wife at such a risk?’ condemning the young men for their excess of passion
3407	metamorphoses	 But when he saw her face and her unclothed body, one like mine, Adonis, or like yours if you were a woman, he was stunned
3408	metamorphoses	 Stretching out his hands, he said: ‘Forgive me, you, that I just blamed! I had not yet realised what the prize was you were after
3409	metamorphoses	’ Praising her, he falls in love with her, and hopes none of the youths run faster, afraid, through jealousy
3410	metamorphoses	 ‘But why, in this competition, is my luck left untested?’ he says
3411	metamorphoses	" The god himself favours the bold!’
"
3412	metamorphoses	While Hippomenes was debating with himself like this, the virgin girl sped by on winged feet
3413	metamorphoses	 To the Aonian youth she flew like a Scythian arrow, yet it made him admire her beauty all the more
3414	metamorphoses	 The race gave her a beauty of its own
3415	metamorphoses	 The breeze blew the streaming feathers on her speeding sandals behind her, and her hair was thrown back from her ivory shoulders
3416	metamorphoses	 Ribbons with embroidered edges fluttered at her knees, and a blush spread over the girlish whiteness of her body, just as when a red awning over a white courtyard stains it with borrowed shadows
3417	metamorphoses	 While the stranger was watching this, the last marker was passed, and the victorious Atalanta was crowned with a festive garland, while the losers, groaning, paid the penalty according to their bond
3418	metamorphoses	Undeterred by the youths’ fate, Hippomenes stepped forward and, fixing his gaze on the girl, said ‘Why seek an easy win beating the lazy? Race me
3419	metamorphoses	 If fortune makes me the master, it will be no shame for you to be outpaced by such a man as me, since Megareus of Onchestus is my father, and his grandfather was Neptune, so I am the great-grandson of the king of the ocean, and my courage is no less than my birth
3420	metamorphoses	 Or if I am beaten, you will have a great and renowned name for defeating Hippomenes
3421	metamorphoses	’ As he spoke Schoeneus’s daughter looked at him with a softening expression, uncertain whether she wanted to win or lose, and said to herself: ‘What god, envious of handsome youths, wants to destroy this one and send him in search of marriage, at the risk of his own dear life? I am not worth that much, I think
3422	metamorphoses	 Nor is it his beauty that moves me (yet I could be touched by that too) but that he is still only a boy
3423	metamorphoses	 He does not move me himself: it is his youth
3424	metamorphoses	 What if he does have courage, and a spirit unafraid of dying? What if he is fourth in line from the ruler of the seas? What if he does love, and thinks so much of marriage with me, that he would die, if a harsh fate denies me to him? While you can, stranger, leave this blood-soaked marrying
3425	metamorphoses	 Wedding me is a cruel thing
3426	metamorphoses	 No one will refuse to have you, and you may be chosen by a wiser girl
3427	metamorphoses	" – Yet why this concern when so many have already died before you?
"
3428	metamorphoses	Let him look out for himself! Let him perish, since he has not been warned off by the death of so many suitors, and shows himself tired of life
3429	metamorphoses	 – Should he die, then, because he wants to live with me, and suffer an unjust death as the penalty for loving? My victory would not avoid incurring hatred
3430	metamorphoses	 But it is not my fault! I wish you would desist, or if you are set on it, I wish you might be the faster! How the virginal expression of a boy clings to his face! O! Poor Hippomenes, I wish you had never seen me! You were so fitted to live
3431	metamorphoses	 But if I were luckier, if the harsh fates did not prevent my marriage, you would be the one I would want to share my bed with
3432	metamorphoses	’ She spoke: and inexperienced, feeling the touch of desire for the first time, not knowing what she does, she loves and does not realise she loves
3433	metamorphoses	"” ’
"
3434	metamorphoses	‘ “Now her father and the people were calling out for the usual foot-race, when Hippomenes, Neptune’s descendant invoked my aid, as a suppliant: ‘Cytherea, I beg you to assist my daring, and encourage the fire of love you lit
3435	metamorphoses	’ A kindly breeze brought me the flattering prayer, and I confess it stirred me, though there was scant time to give him my help
3436	metamorphoses	 There is a field, the people there call it the field of Tamasus, the richest earth in the island of Cyprus, which the men of old made sacred to me, and ordered it to be added to my temples, as a gift
3437	metamorphoses	 A tree gleams in the middle of the field, with rustling golden leaves, and golden branches
3438	metamorphoses	 Come from there, by chance, I was carrying three golden apples, I had picked, in my hands, and I approached Hippomenes, showing myself only to him, and told him how to use them
3439	metamorphoses	The trumpets gave the signal, and, leaning forward, they flashed from the starting line, and skimmed the surface of the sand, with flying feet
3440	metamorphoses	 You would think them capable of running along the waves without wetting them, and passing over the ripened heads of the standing corn
3441	metamorphoses	" The young man’s spirit was cheered by shouts and words of encouragement: ‘Run, Hippomenes! Now, now is the time to sprint! Use your full power, now! Don’t wait: you’ll win!’
"
3442	metamorphoses	Who knows whether Megareus’s heroic son, or Schoeneus’s daughter, was more pleased with these words? O how often, when she could have overtaken him, she lingered, and watching his face for a while, left him behind against her will! Panting breath came from his weary throat, and the winning post was far off
3443	metamorphoses	 Only then did Neptune’s scion throw away one of the fruits from the tree
3444	metamorphoses	 The girl was astonished, and, eager for the shining apple, she ran off the course, and picked up the spinning gold
3445	metamorphoses	 Hippomenes passed her: the stands resounded with the applause
3446	metamorphoses	 She made up for the delay and the lost time by a burst of speed, and left the youth behind once more
3447	metamorphoses	 Again she delayed when a second apple was thrown, followed, and passed the man
3448	metamorphoses	 The last section of track was left
3449	metamorphoses	 ‘Now,’ he said, ‘be near me, goddess who made me this gift!’ He threw the shining gold vigorously, sideways, into the deep field, from where she would take longer to get back
3450	metamorphoses	 The girl seemed to hesitate as to whether she should chase it: I made her pick it up, and added weight to the fruit she held, and obstructed her equally with the heaviness of the burden and the delay
3451	metamorphoses	 And lest my story be longer than the race itself, the virgin was overtaken: the winner led away his prize
3452	metamorphoses	"” ’
"
3453	metamorphoses	‘ “Adonis, did I deserve to be thanked, to have incense brought me? Unthinking, he neither gave thanks, nor offered incense to me
3454	metamorphoses	 I was provoked to sudden anger, and pained by his contempt, so as not to be slighted in future, I decreed an example would be made of them, and I roused myself against them both
3455	metamorphoses	They were passing a temple, hidden in the deep woods, of Cybele mother of the gods, that noble Echion had built in former times fulfilling a vow, and the length of their journey persuaded them to rest
3456	metamorphoses	 There, stirred by my divine power, an untimely desire to make love seized Hippomenes
3457	metamorphoses	 Near the temple was a poorly lit hollow, like a cave, roofed with the natural pumice-stone, sacred to the old religion, where the priests had gathered together wooden figures of the ancient gods
3458	metamorphoses	 They entered it, and desecrated the sanctuary, with forbidden intercourse
3459	metamorphoses	 The sacred images averted their gaze, and the Great Mother, with the turreted crown, hesitated as to whether to plunge the guilty pair beneath the waters of the Styx: but the punishment seemed too light
3460	metamorphoses	 So tawny manes spread over their necks, that, a moment ago, were smooth; their fingers curved into claws; forelegs were formed from arms; all their weight was in their breast; and their tails swept the surface of the sand
3461	metamorphoses	 They had a fierce expression, roared instead of speaking, and frequented the woods for a marriage-bed
3462	metamorphoses	 As lions, fearful to others, they tamely bite on Cybele’s bit
3463	metamorphoses	" You must avoid, them, my love, and with them all the species of wild creature, that do not turn and run, but offer their breasts to the fight, lest your courage be the ruin of us both!” ’
"
3464	metamorphoses	‘She warned him, and made her way through the air, drawn by harnessed swans, but his courage defied the warning
3465	metamorphoses	 By chance, his dogs, following a well-marked trail, roused a wild boar from its lair, and as it prepared to rush from the trees, Cinyras’s grandson caught it a glancing blow
3466	metamorphoses	 Immediately the fierce boar dislodged the blood-stained spear, with its crooked snout, and chased the youth, who was scared and running hard
3467	metamorphoses	 It sank its tusk into his groin, and flung him, dying, on the yellow sand
3468	metamorphoses	Cytherea, carried in her light chariot through the midst of the heavens, by her swans’ swiftness, had not yet reached Cyprus: she heard from afar the groans of the dying boy, and turned the white birds towards him
3469	metamorphoses	 When, from the heights, she saw the lifeless body, lying in its own blood, she leapt down, tearing her clothes, and tearing at her hair, as well, and beat at her breasts with fierce hands, complaining to the fates
3470	metamorphoses	 “And yet not everything is in your power” she said
3471	metamorphoses	 “Adonis, there shall be an everlasting token of my grief, and every year an imitation of your death will complete a re-enactment of my mourning
3472	metamorphoses	 But your blood will be changed into a flower
3473	metamorphoses	 Persephone, you were allowed to alter a woman’s body, Menthe’s, to fragrant mint: shall the transformation of my hero, of the blood of Cinyras, be grudged to me?” So saying, she sprinkled the blood with odorous nectar: and, at the touch, it swelled up, as bubbles emerge in yellow mud
3474	metamorphoses	 In less than an hour, a flower, of the colour of blood, was created such as pomegranates carry, that hide their seeds under a tough rind
3475	metamorphoses	 But enjoyment of it is brief; for, lightly clinging, and too easily fallen, the winds deflower it, which are likewise responsible for its name, windflower: anemone
3476	metamorphoses	While the poet of Thrace, with songs like these, drew to himself the trees, the souls of wild beasts, and the stones that followed him, see, how the frenzied Ciconian women, their breasts covered with animal skins, spy Orpheus from a hilltop, as he matches songs to the sounding strings
3477	metamorphoses	 One of them, her hair scattered to the light breeze, called: ‘Behold, behold, this is the one who scorns us!’ and hurled her spear at the face of Apollo’s poet, as he was singing
3478	metamorphoses	 Tipped with leaves, it marked him, without wounding
3479	metamorphoses	 The next missile was a stone, that, thrown through the air, was itself overpowered by the harmony of voice and lyre, and fell at his feet, as though it were begging forgiveness for its mad audacity
3480	metamorphoses	 But in fact the mindless attack mounted, without restraint, and mad fury ruled
3481	metamorphoses	 All their missiles would have been frustrated by his song, but the huge clamour of the Berecyntian flutes of broken horn, the drums, and the breast-beating and howls of the Bacchantes, drowned the sound of the lyre
3482	metamorphoses	 Then, finally, the stones grew red, with the blood of the poet, to whom they were deaf
3483	metamorphoses	First, the innumerable birds, the snakes, and the procession of wild animals, still entranced by the voice of the singer, a mark of Orpheus’s triumph, were torn apart by the Maenads
3484	metamorphoses	 Then they set their bloody hands on Orpheus, and gathered, like birds that spy the owl, the bird of night, wandering in the daylight, or as in the amphitheatre, on the morning of the staged events, on either side, a doomed stag, in the arena, is prey to the hounds
3485	metamorphoses	 They rushed at the poet, and hurled their green-leaved thyrsi, made for a different use
3486	metamorphoses	 Some threw clods of earth, some branches torn from the trees, and others flints
3487	metamorphoses	 And so that their madness did not lack true weapons, by chance, oxen were turning the soil under the ploughshare, and, not far away from them, brawny farm workers were digging the solid earth, sweating hard to prepare it for use, who fled when they saw the throng, leaving their work tools behind
3488	metamorphoses	 Hoes, heavy mattocks, and long rakes lay scattered through the empty fields
3489	metamorphoses	 After catching these up, and ripping apart the oxen, that threatened them with their horns, the fierce women rushed back to kill the poet
3490	metamorphoses	 As he stretched out his hands, speaking ineffectually for the first time ever, not affecting them in any way with his voice, the impious ones murdered him: and the spirit, breathed out through that mouth to which stones listened, and which was understood by the senses of wild creatures – O, God! – vanished down the wind
3491	metamorphoses	The birds, lamenting, cried for you, Orpheus; the crowd of wild creatures; the hard flints; the trees that often gathered to your song, shedding their leaves, mourned you with bared crowns
3492	metamorphoses	 They say the rivers, also, were swollen with their own tears, and the naiads and dryads, with dishevelled hair, put on sombre clothes
3493	metamorphoses	 The poet’s limbs were strewn in different places: the head and the lyre you, Hebrus, received, and (a miracle!) floating in midstream, the lyre lamented mournfully; mournfully the lifeless tongue murmured; mournfully the banks echoed in reply
3494	metamorphoses	 And now, carried onward to the sea, they left their native river-mouth and reached the shores of Lesbos, at Methymna
3495	metamorphoses	 Here, as the head lay exposed on the alien sand, its moist hair dripping brine, a fierce snake attacked it
3496	metamorphoses	 But at last Phoebus came, and prevented it, as it was about to bite, and turned the serpent’s gaping jaws to stone, and froze the mouth, wide open, as it was
3497	metamorphoses	The ghost of Orpheus sank under the earth, and recognised all those places it had seen before; and, searching the fields of the Blessed, he found his wife again and held her eagerly in his arms
3498	metamorphoses	 There they walk together side by side; now she goes in front, and he follows her; now he leads, and looks back as he can do, in safety now, at his Eurydice
3499	metamorphoses	"’
"
3500	metamorphoses	However, the god, Lyaeus, did not allow such wickedness by his followers to go unpunished
3501	metamorphoses	 Grieved by the loss of the poet of his sacred rites, he immediately fastened down, with twisted roots, all the Thracian women who had seen the sin, since the path, that each one was on at that moment, gripped their toes and forced the tips into the solid ground
3502	metamorphoses	 As a bird, when it is caught in a snare, set by a cunning wild-fowler, and feels itself held, tightens the knot by its movement, beating and flapping; so each of the women, planted, stuck fast, terrified, tried uselessly to run
3503	metamorphoses	 But the pliant roots held her, and checked her, struggling
3504	metamorphoses	 When she looked for where her toenails, toes and feet were, she saw the wood spreading over the curve of her leg, and, trying to strike her thighs with grieving hands, she beat on oak: her breasts turned to oak: her shoulders were oak
3505	metamorphoses	 You would have thought the jointed arms were real branches, and your thought would not have been wrong
3506	metamorphoses	This did not satisfy Bacchus
3507	metamorphoses	 He left the fields themselves, and with a worthier band of followers sought out the vineyards of his own Mount Tmolus, and the River Pactolus, though at that time it was not a golden stream, nor envied for its valuable sands
3508	metamorphoses	 His familiar cohorts, the satyrs and bacchantes accompanied him, but Silenus was absent
3509	metamorphoses	 The Phrygian countrymen had taken him captive, stumbling with age and wine, bound him with garlands, and led him to King Midas, to whom, with Athenian Eumolpus, Orpheus of Thrace had taught the Bacchic rites
3510	metamorphoses	When the king recognised him as a friend and companion of his worship, he joyfully led a celebration of the guest’s arrival, lasting ten days and nights on end
3511	metamorphoses	 And now, on the eleventh day, Lucifer had seen off the train of distant stars, and the king with gladness came to the fields of Lydia, and restored Silenus to his young foster-child
3512	metamorphoses	Then the god, happy at his foster-father’s return, gave Midas control over the choice of a gift, which was pleasing, but futile, since he was doomed to make poor use of his reward
3513	metamorphoses	 ‘Make it so that whatever I touch with my body, turns to yellow gold,’ he said
3514	metamorphoses	 Bacchus accepted his choice, and gave him the harmful gift, sad that he had not asked for anything better
3515	metamorphoses	 The Berecyntian king departed happily, rejoicing in his bane, and testing his faith in its powers by touching things, and scarcely believing it when he broke off a green twig from the low foliage of the holm-oak: the twig was turned to gold
3516	metamorphoses	 He picked up a stone from the ground: the stone also was pale gold
3517	metamorphoses	 He touched a clod of earth, and by the power of touch, the clod became a nugget
3518	metamorphoses	 He gathered the dry husks of corn: it was a golden harvest
3519	metamorphoses	 He held an apple he had picked from a tree: you would think the Hesperides had given it to him
3520	metamorphoses	 If he placed his fingers on the tall door-pillars, the pillars were seen to shine
3521	metamorphoses	 When he washed his hands in clear water, the water flowing over his hands would have deceived Danaë
3522	metamorphoses	His own mind could scarcely contain his expectations, dreaming of all things golden
3523	metamorphoses	 As he was exulting, his servants set a table before him, heaped with cooked food, and loaves were not lacking
3524	metamorphoses	 Then, indeed, if he touched the gift of Ceres with his hand, her gift hardened
3525	metamorphoses	 If he tried, with eager bites, to tear the food, the food was covered with a yellow surface where his teeth touched
3526	metamorphoses	 He mixed pure water with wine, the other gift of his benefactor, but molten gold could be seen trickling through his lips
3527	metamorphoses	Dismayed by this strange misfortune, rich and unhappy, he tries to flee his riches, and hates what he wished for a moment ago
3528	metamorphoses	 No abundance can relieve his famine: his throat is parched with burning thirst, and, justly, he is tortured by the hateful gold
3529	metamorphoses	 Lifting his shining hands and arms to heaven, he cries out: ‘Father, Bacchus, forgive me! I have sinned
3530	metamorphoses	 But have pity on me, I beg you, and save me from this costly evil!’ The will of the gods is kindly
3531	metamorphoses	 Bacchus, when he confessed his fault, restored him, and took back what he had given in fulfilment of his promise
3532	metamorphoses	 ‘So you do not remain coated with the gold you wished for so foolishly,’ he said, ‘go to the river by great Sardis, make your way up the bright ridge against the falling waters, till you come to the source of the stream, and plunge your head and body at the same moment into the foaming fountain, where it gushes out, and at the same time wash away your sin
3533	metamorphoses	’ The king went to the river as he was ordered: the golden virtue coloured the waters, and passed from his human body into the stream
3534	metamorphoses	 Even now, gathering the grains of gold from the ancient vein, the fields harden, their soil soaked by the pale yellow waters
3535	metamorphoses	Hating wealth, Midas lived among woods and fields, and the mountain caves Pan always inhabits
3536	metamorphoses	 But he remained dull-witted, and, as before, his foolish mind was destined once again to hurt its owner
3537	metamorphoses	 Mount Tmolus, stands steep and high, commanding a wide view of the distant sea, its sloping sides extending to Sardis on the one side, and as far as tiny Hypaepae on the other
3538	metamorphoses	 While Pan was there, playing light airs on his reeds glued together with wax, he boasted of his pipings, to the gentle nymphs, and dared to speak slightingly of Apollo’s song compared with his own, and entered an unequal contest with Tmolus, the god of the mountain, as judge
3539	metamorphoses	The aged judge was seated on his mountain-top and shook his ears free of the trees
3540	metamorphoses	 Only an oak-wreath circled his dark hair, and acorns brushed against his hollow temples
3541	metamorphoses	 Looking at the god of the flocks he said: ‘There is nothing to prevent my judging
3542	metamorphoses	’ Pan sounded the rustic reeds, and entranced Midas (who chanced to be near the playing) with wild pipings
3543	metamorphoses	 Following this, sacred Tmolus turned his face towards that of Phoebus: his forests followed
3544	metamorphoses	" 
"
3545	metamorphoses	Phoebus’s golden hair was wreathed with laurel from Parnassus, and his robes dyed with Tyrian purple, swept the earth
3546	metamorphoses	 He held his lyre, inlaid with gems and Indian ivory, in his left hand, and the plectrum in the other
3547	metamorphoses	 His attitude was that of a true artist
3548	metamorphoses	 Then with skilled fingers, he plucked the strings, and Tmolus, captivated by their sweetness, ordered Pan to lower his pipes in submission to the lyre
3549	metamorphoses	The judgement of the sacred mountain-god satisfied all opinions, and yet Midas’s voice alone challenged it and called it unjust
3550	metamorphoses	 The god of Delos did not allow such undiscriminating ears to keep their human form, but drew them out and covered them with shaggy grey hair, and made them flexible at the base, and gave them powers of movement
3551	metamorphoses	 Though the rest was human, he was punished in that sole aspect: he wore the ears of a slow-moving ass
3552	metamorphoses	 He was anxious to conceal them, and tried to detract from the shameful ugliness of his head with a purple turban
3553	metamorphoses	 But the servant who used to trim his long hair with a blade, found it out, who, since he dare not reveal the disgrace he had seen, but eager to broadcast it to the four winds, and unable to keep it to himself, went off quietly and dug a hole in the soil
3554	metamorphoses	 In a tiny voice, he whispered to the hollow earth, and buried his spoken evidence under the infill, and stole away having closed up the hidden trench
3555	metamorphoses	 But a thick bed of quivering reeds began to shoot up there, and as soon as they had grown, at the end of the year, they gave the burrower away: stirred gently, then, by the wind they repeated the buried words, and testified against his master
3556	metamorphoses	Having punished him, Latona’s son left Mount Tmolus and, flying through the clear air, he came to earth in the country of Laomedon, this side of the narrows of the Hellespont, named from Helle, daughter of Nephele
3557	metamorphoses	 To the right of the deeps of Sigeum, and to the left of those of Rhoeteum, there was an ancient altar of Jupiter the Thunderer, ‘source of all oracles’
3558	metamorphoses	 There, Apollo saw Laomedon building the foundations of the new city of Troy
3559	metamorphoses	 The great undertaking prospering with difficulty, and demanding no little resources, he, and Neptune, trident-bearing father of the swelling sea, put on mortal form, and built the walls of the city for the Phrygian king for an agreed amount in gold
3560	metamorphoses	 The edifice stood there
3561	metamorphoses	But the king denied them payment, and as a crowning treachery, perjured himself by claiming they were lying
3562	metamorphoses	 The ruler of the ocean said: ‘You will not go unpunished’, and he turned all his waters against the shores of tight-fisted Troy
3563	metamorphoses	 He flooded the land to form a strait, swept away the farmers’ crops, and buried the fields beneath the waves
3564	metamorphoses	 Even this was insufficient punishment: He demanded also that Hesione, the king’s daughter, be given to a sea-monster, whom Hercules freed, as she was chained to the solid rock
3565	metamorphoses	 Hercules demanded the payment promised, an agreed number of horses
3566	metamorphoses	 But the reward for all his work being refused, he seized the twice-perjured walls of conquered Troy
3567	metamorphoses	 Telamon, his companion, did not go without honour, and Hesione was given to him in marriage
3568	metamorphoses	Peleus, Telamon’s brother, was already distinguished by having a goddess as his wife, and was not more proud of being Jupiter’s grandson (his father Aeacus being the son of Jove by Aegina) as his son-in-law (by marrying Thetis), since he was not the only brother to be Jove’s grandson, but he was the only one to marry a goddess
3569	metamorphoses	For aged Proteus had said to Thetis: ‘Goddess of the waves, conceive: you will be the mother of a warrior who will surpass his father’s deeds when he reaches manhood, and will be more famous than him
3570	metamorphoses	’ So Jupiter, lest earth produce someone greater than himself, fled from union with ocean-dwelling Thetis, though he had felt the hot fire of passion in his heart, and ordered his grandson, Peleus, son of Aeacus, to fulfil his promise, on his behalf, and enter the arms of the sea-maiden
3571	metamorphoses	There is a bay, shaped like a scythe, in Haemonia, its arms projecting in a curved arc, which would provide a harbour, if the waves were deeper: the waters cover the surface of the sand: the shore is solid earth, that takes no footprints, does not hinder a passage, and has no seaweed covering it
3572	metamorphoses	 A myrtle grove grows nearby, dense with its red and black berries
3573	metamorphoses	 There is a cave in the centre, whether fashioned by art or nature is uncertain, but probably by art
3574	metamorphoses	 Often, Thetis you used to come there, naked, seated on a bridled dolphin
3575	metamorphoses	 There Peleus found you, as you lay, overcome by sleep, and when, though influenced by his entreaties, you refused him, he prepared to use force, winding both arms round your neck
3576	metamorphoses	He would have taken you then, if you had not, by your well-known arts, frequently changed your form
3577	metamorphoses	 But when you became a bird, he still held you as a bird; now as a tree, Peleus clung fast to the tree
3578	metamorphoses	 Your third guise was a striped tigress: in fear of that the son of Aeacus loosed his arms from your body
3579	metamorphoses	 Then he entreated the gods of the sea, with wine poured over the waters, with sheep’s entrails, and the smoke of incense, until Proteus, the Carpathian seer spoke from his deep gulfs: ‘Son of Aeacus, you will have the bride you desire, if you bind her, unawares, with nooses and tight cords, while she is lulled asleep in the rocky cave
3580	metamorphoses	 Though she deceives you with a hundred counterfeit shapes, hold her to you, whatever she becomes, until she is again what she was before
3581	metamorphoses	’ So he spoke, and hid his face below the waves, letting the waters flow in upon his final words
3582	metamorphoses	Now Titan was low in the sky, and, his chariot pointed downwards, was close to the western ocean, when the lovely Nereid left the waves, and came to her accustomed bed
3583	metamorphoses	 Peleus had scarcely taken a good grip of her virgin body, when she took on new forms, until she realised her limbs were tightly bound, and her arms spread wide apart
3584	metamorphoses	 Then at length she sighed, saying: ‘Not without some god’s help have you won,’ and she showed herself as Thetis
3585	metamorphoses	 When she acknowledged herself, the hero embraced her, achieved his wish, and conceived with her the mighty Achilles
3586	metamorphoses	Peleus was happy in his wife and son, and was a man for whom all things were successful, if you exclude the crime of killing his brother Phocus
3587	metamorphoses	 Guilty of shedding his brother’s blood, exiled from his father’s country, the soil of Trachin gave him sanctuary
3588	metamorphoses	 Here Ceyx, son of Lucifer, the morning star, ruled, without force or shedding blood, his face filled with his father’s radiance
3589	metamorphoses	 At that time he was sad and unlike his normal self, mourning the loss of his brother, Daedalion
3590	metamorphoses	 The son of Aeacus came to him, weary with cares and travel, and entered the city with a few companions
3591	metamorphoses	 He left the flocks of sheep and cattle he had brought with him in a shady valley not far from the city walls
3592	metamorphoses	 When he was first allowed to meet the king, he held out the draped olive branch of the suppliant, and told him whose son he was, concealed his crime, and lied about the cause of his flight
3593	metamorphoses	 He begged to be allowed to support himself in the city or the fields
3594	metamorphoses	 The king of Trachin replied with these kind words: ‘Peleus, the opportunities in our kingdom are open even to the lower ranks, and I do not rule an inhospitable realm
3595	metamorphoses	 Add to this willingness, the powerful influence of a noble name, and your being the grandson of Jove
3596	metamorphoses	 So waste no time in supplication! You will receive all that you wish
3597	metamorphoses	" Take a share of everything you see, and call it yours! I wish what you see was better than it is!’
"
3598	metamorphoses	And he wept
3599	metamorphoses	 Peleus and his companions asked what the cause was of so much grief, to which he replied: ‘Perhaps you think that bird, the hawk, that lives on prey, and terrifies other winged creatures, always had feathers
3600	metamorphoses	 He was once a man (and – inner nature is so consistent – even then he was fierce, warlike and equipped for violence): his name, Daedalion
3601	metamorphoses	 We were the sons of Lucifer, who summons the dawn, and is last to leave the sky
3602	metamorphoses	 I care for peace; I care for preserving peace; and for my wife
3603	metamorphoses	 Savage warfare pleased my brother
3604	metamorphoses	 His power subdued kings and nations, that now, transformed, flutters the doves of Boeotia
3605	metamorphoses	 He had a daughter, Chione, endowed with great beauty, who at fourteen, and ready for marriage, had a thousand suitors
3606	metamorphoses	 It chanced that Phoebus-Apollo, and Mercury, son of Maia, one returning from his sacred Delphi, the other from the summit of Cyllene, saw her at the same instant, and, at the same instant, flushed with desire
3607	metamorphoses	 Apollo deferred his hope of union with her till the night, but Mercury could not wait, and touched the virgin’s face with his sleep-inducing wand
3608	metamorphoses	 She lay beneath that potent touch, and suffered the assault of the god
3609	metamorphoses	 Night scattered the heavens with stars: Phoebus, having gained access disguised as an old woman, enjoyed the delight that had been forestalled
3610	metamorphoses	 When Chione came to full term she bore the wing-footed god a son, Autolycus, crafty, talented in all intrigue, who could make black seem white, and white black, not unworthy of his father; and to Phoebus (it was a twin birth) she bore Philammon, famous for tuneful song and the lyre
3611	metamorphoses	But what is the benefit in having produced two sons, in having pleased two gods, in being the child of a powerful father, and grandchild of the shining one? Is glory not harmful also to many? It certainly harmed her! She set herself above Diana, and criticized the goddess’s beauty
3612	metamorphoses	 But, the goddess, moved by violent anger, said to her: “Then I must satisfy you with action
3613	metamorphoses	” Without hesitating, she bent her bow, sent an arrow from the string, and pierced the tongue that was at fault, with the shaft
3614	metamorphoses	 The tongue was silent, neither sound nor attempts at words followed: and as she tried to speak, her life ended in blood
3615	metamorphoses	I embraced her, in my misery, feeling a father’s grief in my heart, and spoke words of comfort to my dear brother
3616	metamorphoses	 Her father heard them no more than the cliffs hear the murmuring of the sea, mourning his lost one, bitterly
3617	metamorphoses	 But when he saw the burning of her body, four times he made as if to throw himself into the blazing pyre; four times was thrust back; fled madly; and ran where there were no tracks, like a bullock whose neck is tender from the yoke, tormented by hornets’ stings
3618	metamorphoses	 Even then to me he seemed to run faster than humanly possible, and you would have thought he had winged feet
3619	metamorphoses	He escaped us all, swift with desire for death, and gained the summit of Parnassus
3620	metamorphoses	 When Daedalion hurled himself from the high cliffs, Apollo, pitying him, turned him into a bird, and lifted him, pendent on suddenly-formed wings, giving him a hooked beak, and curved talons, his former courage, and greater strength of body
3621	metamorphoses	 Now, as a hawk, he rages against all birds, is merciful to none, and, suffering, is a cause of suffering
3622	metamorphoses	"’
"
3623	metamorphoses	While Lucifer’s son was telling the strange story of his brother, Peleus’s herdsman, Onetor the Phocian, came racing up, breathing hard with the pace, shouting: ‘Peleus! Peleus! I bring you news of grave trouble
3624	metamorphoses	’ Peleus ordered him to tell it, whatever it was, the Trachinian king himself waiting with anxious face
3625	metamorphoses	 The herdsman said: ‘When the sun was at the zenith, seeing as much of the track left as he had already run, I had driven the tired oxen down to the bay
3626	metamorphoses	 Some of the bullocks were kneeling on the yellow sand, lying there gazing out at the wide expanse of ocean; some were wandering slowly here and there; while others had waded out and stood up to their necks in the water
3627	metamorphoses	 There is a temple near the sea, not gleaming with gold and marble, but made of heavy timber, and shaded by an ancient grove
3628	metamorphoses	 Nereus and the Nereids haunt it (a sailor, drying his nets on the shore, told me they were the gods of those waters)
3629	metamorphoses	 Close to it, there is a swamp, choked with dense willows, which the salt flood has turned into marshland
3630	metamorphoses	 From it, a wolf, a huge beast, terrifies the places round about with its heavy crashing noises
3631	metamorphoses	 It came out of the marsh reeds, its deadly jaws smeared with foam and clots of blood, and its eyes filled with red flame
3632	metamorphoses	 It was savage with rage and hunger, more with rage; since though hungry it did not bother with the dead cattle, or with satisfying its deadly appetite, but wounded the whole herd, slaughtering them all in its hostility
3633	metamorphoses	 Some of our men were wounded by its fatal jaws while protecting them, and given up as dead
3634	metamorphoses	 The shore and the shallows were red with blood, and the marshes full of bellowing
3635	metamorphoses	 But delay is fatal: the thing allows no hesitation
3636	metamorphoses	" While there are some of us left, let us encounter it in armour, and, seizing our weapons, meet with it carrying spears!’
"
3637	metamorphoses	So the countryman spoke: the losses did not stir Peleus: conscious of his guilt he concluded that Psamathe, the bereaved Nereid, was sending a funeral offering to her murdered son Phocus, by means of those same losses
3638	metamorphoses	 Oetean King Ceyx ordered his men to put on their armour, and take their deadly spears, while he was himself preparing to go with them
3639	metamorphoses	 But Alcyone, his wife, disturbed by the shouting, scattering her hair that she had not yet quite arranged, flung herself on her husband’s neck, begging him, with words and tears, to send help, but not to go himself, and protect both their lives, by protecting his own
3640	metamorphoses	 Peleus, the son of Aeacus, said: ‘Queen Alcyone, forget these loving fears that so become you! I am grateful for your husband’s offer of help, but I have no wish for arms to be used against the creature on my behalf
3641	metamorphoses	" I must pray, instead, to the goddess of the ocean!’
"
3642	metamorphoses	There was a high tower; a beacon on top of the citadel; a welcome sight for labouring vessels
3643	metamorphoses	 They climbed up, and looked out, with murmuring sighs, at the cattle lying on the shore, seeing their rampaging killer with bloody jaws, its shaggy pelt dripping gore
3644	metamorphoses	 There, stretching his hands out towards the shores of the open sea, Peleus prayed to sea-born Psamathe to forget her anger, and to aid him
3645	metamorphoses	 She was unmoved by the prayers of the son of Aeacus, but Thetis, as a suppliant for her husband, obtained her forgiveness
3646	metamorphoses	The wolf persisted even when ordered away from the savage slaughter, maddened by the taste of blood, until the goddess changed it to marble, as it was clinging to the wounded neck of a heifer
3647	metamorphoses	 The body remained completely the same, except for its colour: the colour of the stone showed it no longer wolf, no longer to be feared
3648	metamorphoses	 But the fates did not allow the exiled Peleus to remain in that country
3649	metamorphoses	 The wandering fugitive reached Magnesia, and there was absolved of the murder by Haemonian King Acastus
3650	metamorphoses	Meanwhile Ceyx, troubled by heart’s anxiety, concerning his brother, and what had followed his brother’s strange fate, was preparing to go and consult the sacred oracle of Apollo, at Claros, that reveals human affairs
3651	metamorphoses	 The infamous Phorbas, leader of the Phlegyans, had made Delphi inaccessible
3652	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless, before he set out, he discussed it with you, faithful Alcyone
3653	metamorphoses	She felt a chill, immediately, deep in her marrow, her face grew boxwood-pale, and her cheeks were drenched in flowing tears
3654	metamorphoses	 Three times she tried to speak, three times her face was wet with weeping, and sobs interrupting her loving reproaches, she said: ‘What sin of mine has turned your mind to this, dear one? Where is that care for me that used to come first? Can you now leave Alcyone behind, without a thought? Does it please you now to travel far? Am I dearer to you, away from you? But I suppose your way is overland, and I shall only grieve, not fear, for you
3655	metamorphoses	 My anxieties will be free from terror
3656	metamorphoses	The waters scare me, and the sombre face of the deep: and lately I saw wrecked timbers on the shore, and I have often read the names on empty tombs
3657	metamorphoses	 Do not allow your mind to acquire false confidence, because Aeolus, son of Hippotas, is your father-in-law, who keeps the strong winds imprisoned, and, when he wishes, calms the sea
3658	metamorphoses	 When once the winds are released and hold sway over the waters, nothing can oppose them: every country, every ocean is exposed to them
3659	metamorphoses	 They vex the clouds in the sky, and create the red lightning-flashes from their fierce collisions
3660	metamorphoses	 The more I know of them (I do know them, often seeing them as a child in my father’s house) the more I consider them to be feared
3661	metamorphoses	 But if no prayers can alter your purpose, dear one, husband, if you are so fixed on going, take me with you, also! Then we shall be storm-tossed together, and at least I shall know what I fear, together we shall bear whatever comes, together we shall be borne over the waters
3662	metamorphoses	"’
"
3663	metamorphoses	The star-born husband was moved by the daughter of Aeolus’s words and tears: there was no less love in himself
3664	metamorphoses	 But he would not relinquish his planned sea-journey, nor did he want to put Alcyone in peril
3665	metamorphoses	 His anxious heart tried to comfort her, with many words, yet, despite that, he could not win his case
3666	metamorphoses	 He added this further solace, the only one that moved his lover: ‘Every delay will seem long to us indeed, but I swear to you by my father’s light, to return to you as long as the fates allow it, before the moon has twice completed her circle
3667	metamorphoses	"’
"
3668	metamorphoses	When her hopes had been revived by these promises of return, he immediately ordered the ship to be dragged down the slipway, launched into the sea, and fitted out with her gear
3669	metamorphoses	 Alcyone, seeing this, as if she foresaw what was to come, shuddered again, and she gave way to a flood of tears
3670	metamorphoses	 She hugged him, and, in wretched misery, said a last ‘Farewell’ and her whole body gave way beneath her
3671	metamorphoses	 With Ceyx still seeking reasons for delay, the young crew, double-ranked, pulled on the oars, with deep-chested strokes, and cut the water with their rhythmic blows
3672	metamorphoses	She raised her wet eyes, and leaning forward could see her husband standing on the curved afterdeck, waving his hand, and she returned the signal
3673	metamorphoses	 When he was further from shore, and she could no longer recognise his features, she followed the fleeting ship with her gaze, while she could
3674	metamorphoses	 When even that was too far off to be seen, she still could see the topsails unfurling from the masthead
3675	metamorphoses	 When no sails could be seen, with heavy heart, she sought out the empty bedroom, and threw herself on the bed
3676	metamorphoses	 The room and the bed provoked more tears and reminded her of her absent half
3677	metamorphoses	They had left the harbour, and the breeze was stirring the rigging: the captain shipped the oars, ran the yard up to the top of the mast, and put on all sail to catch the freshening breeze
3678	metamorphoses	 The ship was cutting through the waves, no more than mid-way across, maybe less, far from either shore, when, at nightfall, the sea began to whiten with swelling waves, and the east wind to blow with greater strength
3679	metamorphoses	The captain shouts: ‘Lower the yards, now, and close reef all sails
3680	metamorphoses	’ He shouts the order but the adverse wind drowns it, and his voice cannot be heard above the breaking seas
3681	metamorphoses	 Yet, some of the crew, on their own initiative, remove the oars, some protect the bulwarks, some deny the wind canvas-room
3682	metamorphoses	 Here one bails water back into the water, another secures the spars
3683	metamorphoses	 While these things are being done, randomly, the storm increases its severity, and the roaring winds attack from every quarter, stirring the angry waves
3684	metamorphoses	 The captain himself is fearful, and admits he does not know how things stand, what to order, what to prevent: such is the weight of destruction, so much more powerful than his skill
3685	metamorphoses	There is uproar: men shouting, the rigging straining, the sound of the breaking sea from a weight of sea, and the crash of thunder
3686	metamorphoses	 The waves rise up and seem to form the sky, and their spray touches the lowering clouds
3687	metamorphoses	 Now the water is tainted yellow, with sand churned from the depths, now blacker than the Styx, while the waves break white with hissing foam
3688	metamorphoses	 The Trachinian ship is driven in the grip of fate, now lifted on high, as if looking down on the valleys from a mountain summit, into the depths of Acheron: now sinking, caught in the trough of the wave, staring at heaven from the infernal pool
3689	metamorphoses	 Again and again the force of the flood strikes the sides with a huge crash, sounding no lighter a blow than when, sometime, an iron ram, or a ballista, strikes a damaged fortress
3690	metamorphoses	 As fierce lions, on the attack, drive themselves onto the armoured chests and extended spears of the hunters, so the waves drove forward in the rising winds, reaching the height of the ship, and higher, above it
3691	metamorphoses	And now the wooden wedges give way, and, stripped of their wax covering, cracks appear, offering the lethal waves a passage
3692	metamorphoses	 Look how the heavy rain falls from the melting clouds, and you would think the whole heaven was emptying into the sea, and the sea was filling the heavenly zones
3693	metamorphoses	 The sails are soaked with spray, and the seawater mingles with water from the heavens
3694	metamorphoses	 The sky is starless, and the murky night is full of its own and the storm’s gloom
3695	metamorphoses	 Flashes of lightning cleave it, and give light: the rain is illuminated by the lightning flares
3696	metamorphoses	Now the sea pours into the ship’s hollow hull, as well
3697	metamorphoses	 As a soldier, more outstanding than the rest, who has often tried to scale the battlement of a besieged city, succeeds at last, and fired with a love of glory, takes the wall, one man in a thousand; so when the waves have battered nine times against the steep sides, the tenth wave surging with greater impetus rushes on, and does not cease its assault on the beleaguered craft, until it breaches the conquered vessel’s defences
3698	metamorphoses	 So one part of the sea is still trying to take the ship, and part is already inside
3699	metamorphoses	All is confusion, as a city is confused when some are undermining the walls from outside, while others hold them from within
3700	metamorphoses	 Skill fails, and courage ebbs, and as many separate deaths as advancing waves seem to rush upon them and burst over them
3701	metamorphoses	 One cannot hold his tears, another is stupefied, and one cries out that they are fortunate whom proper burial rites await
3702	metamorphoses	 One worships the gods in prayer, and, lifting his arms in vain to the sky, he cannot see, begs for help
3703	metamorphoses	 Some think of fathers and brothers, some of home and children, or whatever they have left behind
3704	metamorphoses	 But Alcyone is what moves Ceyx: nothing but Alcyone is on Ceyx’s lips, and though he only longs for her, he rejoices that she is not there
3705	metamorphoses	How he would like to see his native shores again, and turn his last gaze towards his home, but he knows not where it is: the sea swirls in such vortices, and the covering shadows of pitch-black clouds so hide the sky, that it mirrors the aspect of night
3706	metamorphoses	 The mast is shattered by the onset of a storm-driven whirlwind, and the rudder is shattered
3707	metamorphoses	 One ultimate wave, like a conqueror delighting in his spoils, rears up gazing down at the other waves, and, as if one tore Pindus, and Athos, from their base, and threw them utterly into the open sea, it fell headlong, and the weight and the impulse together, drove the ship to the bottom
3708	metamorphoses	 The majority of the crew met their fate with the ship, driven down by the mass of water, never to return to the light
3709	metamorphoses	 The rest clung to broken pieces of the vessel
3710	metamorphoses	Ceyx himself, held on to a fragment of the wreck, with a hand more used to holding a sceptre, and called on his father, Lucifer, and his father-in-law, Aeolus, but alas, in vain
3711	metamorphoses	 Mostly it is his wife’s, Alcyone’s, name on his lips
3712	metamorphoses	He thinks of her, and speaks to her, and prays that the waves might carry his body to her sight, and that, lifeless, he might be entombed by her dear hands
3713	metamorphoses	 While he can swim, and as often as the waves allow him to open his mouth, he speaks the name of Alcyone, far off, until the waves themselves murmur it, See, a black arc of water breaks over the heart of the sea, and the bursting wave buries his drowning head
3714	metamorphoses	Lucifer was indistinct, and not to be known, that dawn, and since he was not allowed to leave the sky, he covered his face in dense cloud
3715	metamorphoses	Meanwhile, Alcyone, Aeolus’s daughter, counts the nights, unaware of this great misfortune, quickly weaving clothes for him to wear, and for herself, for when he returns, and she promises herself the homecoming that will not be
3716	metamorphoses	 She piously offers incense to all the gods, but worships mostly at Juno’s temple, coming to the altars for a man who is no more, hoping her husband is safe, and returning to her, preferring her above any other woman
3717	metamorphoses	 Of all her prayers, only this could be granted
3718	metamorphoses	The goddess could no longer bear these appeals for one who was dead, and, to free her altar from those inauspicious hands, she said: ‘Iris, most faithful carrier of my words, go quickly to the heavy halls of Sleep, and order him to send Alcyone a dream-figure in the shape of her dead Ceyx, to tell her his true fate
3719	metamorphoses	’ As she spoke, Iris donned her thousand-coloured robe, and, tracing her watery bow on the sky, she searched out, as ordered, the palace of that king, hid under cloud
3720	metamorphoses	There is a deeply cut cave, a hollow mountain, near the Cimmerian country, the house and sanctuary of drowsy Sleep
3721	metamorphoses	 Phoebus can never reach it with his dawn, mid-day or sunset rays
3722	metamorphoses	 Clouds mixed with fog, and shadows of the half-light, are exhaled from the ground
3723	metamorphoses	 No waking cockerel summons Aurora with his crowing: no dog disturbs the silence with its anxious barking, or goose, cackling, more alert than a dog
3724	metamorphoses	 No beasts, or cattle, or branches in the breeze, no clamour of human tongues
3725	metamorphoses	 There still silence dwells
3726	metamorphoses	 But out of the stony depths flows Lethe’s stream, whose waves, sliding over the loose pebbles, with their murmur, induce drowsiness
3727	metamorphoses	 In front of the cave mouth a wealth of poppies flourish, and innumerable herbs, from whose juices dew-wet Night gathers sleep, and scatters it over the darkened earth
3728	metamorphoses	 There are no doors in the palace, lest a turning hinge lets out a creak, and no guard at the threshold
3729	metamorphoses	 But in the cave’s centre there is a tall bed made of ebony, downy, black-hued, spread with a dark-grey sheet, where the god himself lies, his limbs relaxed in slumber
3730	metamorphoses	 Around him, here and there, lie uncertain dreams, taking different forms, as many as the ears of corn at harvest, as the trees bear leaves, or grains of sand are thrown onshore
3731	metamorphoses	When the nymph entered and, with her hands, brushed aside the dreams in her way, the sacred place shone with the light of her robes
3732	metamorphoses	" The god, hardly able to lift his eyes heavy with sleep, again and again, falling back, striking his nodding chin on his chest, at last shook himself free of his own influence, and resting on an elbow asked her (for he knew her) why she had come, and she replied:
"
3733	metamorphoses	‘Sleep, all things’ rest: Sleep, gentlest of the gods, the spirit’s peace, whom care flies from: who soothes the body wearied with toil, and readies it for fresh labours: Sleep, order a likeness, that mirrors his true form, and let it go, the image of King Ceyx, to Alcyone, in Trachin of Hercules, and depict a phantasm of the wreck
3734	metamorphoses	 This, Juno commands
3735	metamorphoses	"’
"
3736	metamorphoses	After she had completed her commission, Iris departed, no longer able to withstand the power of sleep, and, feeling the drowsiness steal over her body, she fled, and re-crossed the arch by which she had lately come
3737	metamorphoses	From a throng of a thousand sons, his father roused Morpheus, a master craftsman and simulator of human forms
3738	metamorphoses	 No one else is as clever at expressing the movement, the features, and the sound of speech
3739	metamorphoses	 He depicts the clothes and the usual accents
3740	metamorphoses	 He alone imitates human beings
3741	metamorphoses	 A second son becomes beast, or bird, or long snake’s body
3742	metamorphoses	 The gods call him Icelos, the mortal crowd Phobetor
3743	metamorphoses	 The third, of diverse artistry, is Phantasos: he takes illusory shapes of all inanimate things, earth, stones, rivers, trees
3744	metamorphoses	 These are the ones that show themselves by night to kings and generals, the rest wander among citizens and commoners
3745	metamorphoses	 Old Somnus passed them by, choosing one of all these brothers, Morpheus, to carry out the command of Iris, daughter of Thaumas, and relaxing again into sweet drowsiness, his head drooped and he settled into his deep bed
3746	metamorphoses	Flying through the shadows on noiseless wings, Morpheus, after a short delay, comes to the Haemonian city
3747	metamorphoses	 Shedding his wings, he takes the shape of Ceyx, pallid like the dead, and naked, and stands before his unfortunate wife’s bed
3748	metamorphoses	 He appears with sodden beard, and seawater dripping from his matted hair
3749	metamorphoses	 Then he bends over her pillow, with tears streaming down his face, and says: ‘My poor wife, do you know your Ceyx, or has my face altered in death? Look at me: you will recognise me, and find for a husband, a husband’s shade! Your prayers have brought me no help, Alcyone! I am dead! Do not hold out false hopes of my return! Storm-laden Auster, the south wind, caught the ship in Aegean waters, and tossed in tempestuous blasts, wrecked her there
3750	metamorphoses	 My lips, calling helplessly on your name, drank the waves
3751	metamorphoses	 No dubious author announces this news to you, nor do you hear it as a vague report: I myself, drowned, as you see me before you, tell my fate
3752	metamorphoses	 Get up, act, shed tears, wear mourning: do not let me go down unwept to Tartarus’s void
3753	metamorphoses	"’
"
3754	metamorphoses	Morpheus spoke these words in a voice she would believe to be her husband’s (the tears that he wept also seemed real tears) and his hands revealed Ceyx’s gestures
3755	metamorphoses	 Alcyone groaned, tearfully, stirring her arms in sleep, and seeking his body, grasped only air, and cried out: ‘Wait for me! Where do you vanish? We will go together
3756	metamorphoses	’ Roused by her own voice, and her husband’s image, she started up out of sleep
3757	metamorphoses	 First she gazed round to see if he was still there, the one she had just seen
3758	metamorphoses	 At the sound of her cry the servants had brought a lamp
3759	metamorphoses	 Not finding him anywhere, she struck her face with her hands, tore her clothes from her breasts, and beat at the breasts themselves
3760	metamorphoses	 She did not wait to loosen her hair, but tore at it, and shouted at her nurse, who asked the cause of her grief: ‘Alcyone is nothing, is nothing: she has died together with her Ceyx
3761	metamorphoses	 Be done with soothing words! He is wrecked: I saw him, I knew him, I stretched out my hands towards him as he vanished, eager to hold him back
3762	metamorphoses	 It was a shadow, yet it was my husband’s true shadow, made manifest
3763	metamorphoses	 True, he did not have his accustomed features, if you ask me, nor did his face shine as before
3764	metamorphoses	 But pallid and naked, with dripping hair, I, the unfortunate one, saw him
3765	metamorphoses	 Look, my poor husband stood on that very spot,’ and she tried to find a trace of his footprints
3766	metamorphoses	 ‘This is what I feared, with my divining mind, this: and I begged you not to leave me, chasing the winds
3767	metamorphoses	 But, for certain, I should have desired you to take me with you, since you were going to your death
3768	metamorphoses	 How good it would have been to have gone with you: then no part of my life would have lacked your presence, nor would we be separated by death
3769	metamorphoses	 Now I have died absent from myself, and am thrown through the waves, absently, and the sea takes me, without me
3770	metamorphoses	My mind would treat me more cruelly than the sea, if I should try to live on, and fight to overcome my sorrow! But I shall not fight, nor leave you, my poor husband, and at least now I shall come as your companion
3771	metamorphoses	 If not the sepulchral urn the lettered stone will join us: if I shall not touch you, bone to my bone, still I will touch you, name to name
3772	metamorphoses	’ Grief choked further words, and lamentation took their place wholly, and sighs drawn from a stricken heart
3773	metamorphoses	Morning had broken
3774	metamorphoses	 She went out of the house towards the shore, sadly seeking the place where she had watched him depart
3775	metamorphoses	 And while she stayed there, and while she was saying: ‘Here he loosed the rope, on this strand he kissed me as he left,’ and while she recalled the significant actions by their locations, and looked seawards, she saw in the flowing waves what looked like a body, unsure at first what it was: after the tide had brought it a little nearer, though it was some way off, it was clearly a body
3776	metamorphoses	" She did not know whose it was, but was moved by the omen of this shipwrecked man, and as if she wept for the unknown dead, she cried out: ‘Alas for you, poor soul, whoever you may be, and your wife, if you have one!’ The body had been washed nearer by the sea, and the more she gazed at it, the smaller and smaller shrank her courage: woe! Now it was close to land, now she could see who it was: it was her husband! She cried out: ‘It’s him!’ and together tearing at cheeks, and hair, and clothes she stretched out her trembling hands to Ceyx, saying: ‘O, is it like this, dear husband, is it like this, wretched one, you return to me?’
"
3777	metamorphoses	A breakwater built by the waves, broke the initial force of the sea, and weakened the onrush of the tide
3778	metamorphoses	 Though it was amazing that she could do so, she leapt onto it: she flew, and, beating the soft air on new-found wings, a sorrowing bird, she skimmed the surface of the waves
3779	metamorphoses	 As she flew, her plaintive voice came from a slender beak, like someone grieving and full of sorrows
3780	metamorphoses	 When she reached the mute and bloodless corpse, she clasped the dear limbs with her new wings and kissed the cold lips in vain with her hard beak
3781	metamorphoses	People doubted whether Ceyx felt this, or merely seemed to raise his face by a movement of the waves, but he did feel it: and at last through the gods’ pity, both were changed to birds, the halcyons
3782	metamorphoses	 Though they suffered the same fate, their love remained as well: and their bonds were not weakened, by their feathered form
3783	metamorphoses	 They mate and rear their young, and Alcyone broods on her nest, for seven calm days in the wintertime, floating on the water’s surface
3784	metamorphoses	 Then the waves are stilled: Aeolus imprisons the winds and forbids their roaming, and controls his grandsons’ waves
3785	metamorphoses	Seeing these birds flying together over the wide sea, some old man praised those affections maintained till the end
3786	metamorphoses	 Someone near by, or the same man (pointing to a long-necked diving bird) said: ‘That bird also, skimming over the ocean, trailing his slender legs, is a descendant of kings
3787	metamorphoses	 If you want to trace his ancestry in unbroken line to himself, its source was Ilus the younger, the son of Tros, and his brothers Assaracus, and Ganymede, whom Jove snatched, Ilus’s son, old Laomedon, and his son Priam, whom fate assigned to Troy’s last days
3788	metamorphoses	 That bird was Hector’s brother, Aesacus, who, if he had not met his strange fate in youth, would perhaps have had no less a name than Hector, though Hecuba, daughter of Dymas, bore Priam the first, the other Aesacus, is said to have been born to Alexirrhoë, daughter of two-horned Granicus, the river-god, in secret, under the shadow of Mount Ida
3789	metamorphoses	He hated cities, and lived in the remote mountains, and insignificant country places, far away from the glittering court, and rarely visited crowded Ilium
3790	metamorphoses	 Yet he did not have an uncultured heart, or one averse to love, and he often pursued Hesperie, the River Cebren’s daughter, through all the woodland glades, whom he had caught sight of, drying her flowing hair, in the sun, on her father’s shore
3791	metamorphoses	 The nymph fled on sight, as a frightened hind flees the tawny wolf, or a wild duck, caught far from the pool she left, the hawk
3792	metamorphoses	 But the Trojan hero, driven by swift love, followed her, driven by swift fear
3793	metamorphoses	 Behold, a serpent, hidden in the grass, bit her foot with his curving fang, as she fled by, and left his poison in her body
3794	metamorphoses	 Her flight ended with her life
3795	metamorphoses	 The lover clasped her unbreathing body and cried: ‘I regret, I regret I followed you! But I did not expect this, and it was not worth this to attempt to win you
3796	metamorphoses	 We two have destroyed you, poor girl: the wound given by a snake, the cause of it all myself! Let me be the more accursed, if I do not send you solace by my death
3797	metamorphoses	"’
"
3798	metamorphoses	He spoke, and threw himself from a cliff, eroded below by the rough waves, into the sea
3799	metamorphoses	 Tethys, pitying him, caught him gently as he fell, clothed him with feathers as he floated on the water, and denied him the opportunity to choose his death
3800	metamorphoses	 The lover was angered, that he was forced to live, against his will, and that his spirit was thwarted, wishing to leave its unhappy residence
3801	metamorphoses	 When he had gained the new wings on his shoulders, he flew up and threw his body again into the sea
3802	metamorphoses	 His feathers broke his fall
3803	metamorphoses	 In a rage, Aesacus dived headlong into the deep and tried endlessly to find a path to death
3804	metamorphoses	 His love made him lean: his legs are long between the joints: his neck remained long: his head is far from his body
3805	metamorphoses	 He loves seawater, and from diving there he takes his name, mergus, the diver
3806	metamorphoses	The father, Priam, mourned for the son, Aesacus, not knowing that he was still alive in winged form
3807	metamorphoses	 Hector with his brothers had also, inappropriately, offered sacrifices at a tomb inscribed with his name
3808	metamorphoses	 Paris was not present at this sad ritual, he, who presently brought extended war on his country because of the wife he had stolen
3809	metamorphoses	 The whole Pelasgian race, joined together to pursue him, in a thousand ships, and vengeance would not have been long in coming had not fierce winds made the seas un-navigable, and the land of Boeotia detained the waiting ships in the fishing-grounds of Aulis
3810	metamorphoses	 After they had prepared a sacrifice to Jupiter there, after the customs of their country, and when the ancient altar was alive with the kindled flames, the Greeks saw a dark-green snake sliding into a plane tree that stood near to where they had begun the sacrifice
3811	metamorphoses	 There was a nest with eight young birds in the crown of the tree, and these the serpent seized and swallowed in its eager jaws, together with the mother bird who circled her doomed fledglings
3812	metamorphoses	They looked at it wonderingly, but Calchas, the seer, son of Thestor, interpreted the truth, saying: ‘We will conquer, Greeks, rejoice! Troy will fall, though our efforts will be of long duration,’ and he divined nine years of war from the nine birds
3813	metamorphoses	 The snake was turned to stone, exactly as it was, twined around the green branches, and stamped in the stone its serpent shape
3814	metamorphoses	Boreas, the north-wind, continued to stir the waves violently, and would not grant the warships a crossing, and some thought Neptune was sparing Troy, because he had built its walls
3815	metamorphoses	 But not Calchas
3816	metamorphoses	 He knew and did not withhold from them, that a virgin’s blood would appease the wrath of Diana, the virgin goddess
3817	metamorphoses	 When consideration of the common cause had conquered affection, and the king had suppressed the father, and as Iphigenia stood, among her weeping attendants, before the altar, to surrender her innocent blood, the goddess was vanquished, and veiled their eyes in mist, and, in the midst of the rites and confusion of the sacrifice, and the cries of the suppliants, they say she substituted a hind for the Mycenean girl
3818	metamorphoses	 When, therefore, Diana had been appeased, by the required victim, and the sea’s anger had subsided simultaneously with that of Phoebe, the thousand ships, driven by a tail wind, reached the shores of Phrygia, after many adventures
3819	metamorphoses	There is a place at the centre of the World, between the zones of earth, sea, and sky, at the boundary of the three worlds
3820	metamorphoses	 From here, whatever exists is seen, however far away, and every voice reaches listening ears
3821	metamorphoses	 Rumour lives there, choosing a house for herself on a high mountain summit, adding innumerable entrances, a thousand openings, and no doors to bar the threshold
3822	metamorphoses	 It is open night and day: and is all of sounding bronze
3823	metamorphoses	 All rustles with noise, echoes voices, and repeats what is heard
3824	metamorphoses	 There is no peace within: no silence anywhere
3825	metamorphoses	 Yet there is no clamour, only the subdued murmur of voices, like the waves of the sea, if you hear them far off, or like the sound of distant thunder when Jupiter makes the dark clouds rumble
3826	metamorphoses	Crowds fill the hallways: a fickle populace comes and goes, and, mingling truth randomly with fiction, a thousand rumours wander, and confused words circulate
3827	metamorphoses	 Of these, some fill idle ears with chatter, others carry tales, and the author adds something new to what is heard
3828	metamorphoses	 Here is Credulity: here is rash Error, empty Delight, and alarming Fear, sudden Sedition, and Murmurings of doubtful origin
3829	metamorphoses	 Rumour herself sees everything that happens in the heavens, throughout the ocean, and on land, and inquires about everything on earth
3830	metamorphoses	She had spread the news that the Greek fleet was nearing, filled with brave warriors, and so the arrival of the armed host was no surprise
3831	metamorphoses	 The Trojans opposed the landing, and defended their coast
3832	metamorphoses	 You, Protesilaüs, were the first to fall beneath Hector’s deadly spear, and joining in battle cost the Greeks dearly, and they knew mighty Hector’s spirit by the slaughter
3833	metamorphoses	 The Phrygians learnt at no small expense of blood, the power of an Achaian hand
3834	metamorphoses	 Now the Sigean shores ran red: now Cycnus, a son of Neptune, had consigned a thousand men to death: now Achilles pursued in his chariot, and laid whole columns of men low with a blow of his spear from Pelion
3835	metamorphoses	 Searching the battlelines for Cycnus or for Hector, he came upon Cycnus (His meeting with Hector postponed till the tenth year of the war)
3836	metamorphoses	Then Achilles, urging on his horses, their snowy necks straining against the harness, he drove his chariot straight at the enemy, striking out, with the quivering spear, with all his strength, saying: ‘O youth, whoever you may be, take death’s comfort in being killed by Achilles of Haemonia!’ So Aeacides spoke: His heavy spear followed the words, but although there was certainly no error in the flight of the spear, still the sharp point of the flying blade had no effect, and only bruised Cycnus’s chest, like a blunted weapon
3837	metamorphoses	 ‘O son of the goddess,’ Cycnus said, ‘fame has made you known to me, why are you amazed I have no wound? (He was indeed amazed) Neither this helmet you see, with its yellow horsehair crest, nor the hollow shield weighing down my left arm, is to protect me: they only look to serve as ornament
3838	metamorphoses	 Mars too wears his armour for this reason! Take away the use of this protective covering: I will still escape unharmed
3839	metamorphoses	 It is worth something to be the son, not of Nereus’s daughter, but of him who rules Nereus and his daughters, and the whole ocean as well
3840	metamorphoses	"’
"
3841	metamorphoses	He spoke, and hurled his spear at Achilles, but it stuck fast in his round bronze shield
3842	metamorphoses	 It tore through the bronze and nine layers of bull’s hide, but was stopped by a tenth
3843	metamorphoses	 Shaking it off, the Greek hero once more threw a quivering spear from his mighty hand
3844	metamorphoses	 Again his enemy’s body was whole and unharmed
3845	metamorphoses	 A third spear could not even graze Cycnus though he laid himself open to it
3846	metamorphoses	 Achilles flared up, like a bull in the arena, when it charges with its deadly horns at the Carthaginian cloak, and finds it escapes damage
3847	metamorphoses	 He examined the spear to see if the iron point had been loosened: it was fixed to the shaft
3848	metamorphoses	 ‘Is my hand enfeebled,’ he said, ‘so that the power it had is lacking against this man?’ Certainly it was strong enough when I led the overthrow of Lyrnessus’s walls, or when I drenched the island of Tenedos, and Mysian Thebes, Eetion’s city, in their own blood, when the River Caïcus ran red with the slaughter of those around it, and Telephus twice felt the touch of my spear
3849	metamorphoses	 Here also, my right hand has prevailed, and will prevail, striking so many, the heaps of corpses I made and see on the shore
3850	metamorphoses	"’
"
3851	metamorphoses	He spoke, and as if not believing the results of his previous actions, he threw the spear straight at Menoetes, one of the Lycian men, simultaneously piercing his breastplate and the breast beneath
3852	metamorphoses	 As the dying man beat his head against the solid earth, Achilles pulled the spear from the hot wound, and cried: ‘This is the hand, and this is the spear with which I have just been victorious: I shall use it on this enemy, and I pray his end may be the same
3853	metamorphoses	’ Thus he pursued the death of Cycnus again, and the ashen shaft did not err, thudding unavoidably into the left shoulder, from which it recoiled as if from a wall or a solid rock
3854	metamorphoses	 Achilles saw that Cycnus was stained with blood where it struck, and exulted, but in vain: there was no wound: it was Menoetes’s blood! Then truly maddened, he leapt headlong from his high chariot, and seeking out his charmed enemy, at close quarters, with glittering sword, saw shield and helmet carved through, but still the iron blunted on the impenetrable body
3855	metamorphoses	 He could stand it no longer, and he beat at the face and hollow temples of his enemy three or four times with his raised shield and sword-hilt
3856	metamorphoses	One presses as the other gives way: he rushes and harries him, allowing no respite from the shock
3857	metamorphoses	 Fear grips Cycnus, shadows swim in front of his eyes, and, as he steps backwards, his retreating step is blocked, by a boulder, on the open ground
3858	metamorphoses	 As he is trapped with his body bent against it, Achilles turns him over with great force, and dashes him to the ground
3859	metamorphoses	 Then pressing his hard knees and shield into Cycnus’s chest, he pulls on the helmet straps, which, tightening under the chin, squeeze the throat and windpipe, and stop the passage of breath
3860	metamorphoses	 He prepares to strip his defeated enemy: he sees empty armour: the god of the sea has changed the body into that of a white bird, whose name is the one he bore, but a moment ago
3861	metamorphoses	This battle brought about that truce, of many days duration, when both sides grounded their weapons and rested
3862	metamorphoses	 While alert sentries patrolled the Trojan walls and alert sentries patrolled the Greek trenches, a feast day arrived, on which Achilles, the victor over Cycnus, was propitiating Pallas with the blood of a sacrificial cow
3863	metamorphoses	 When its entrails had been placed on the blazing altars, and the perfume the gods love had climbed to the heavens, part was put aside for their holy rites, and the rest set out on the tables
3864	metamorphoses	 The leaders reclined on couches, and ate their fill of the roasted meat, while they quenched their thirst, and drowned their cares, with wine
3865	metamorphoses	 The zither, the sound of singing, the long boxwood flute pierced with many holes, was not their entertainment, rather they lengthened the night with talk, and courage was their theme
3866	metamorphoses	 They talked of their enemies’ battles, and of their own, and delighted in recounting, in turn, the dangers they had encountered and survived
3867	metamorphoses	" What else should Achilles speak of, and what else should be spoken of in great Achilles’s presence?
"
3868	metamorphoses	The foremost talk was of his latest victory, the overthrow of Cycnus
3869	metamorphoses	 It seemed wondrous to all of them that a warrior should have a body no spear could penetrate, impervious to wounds, and that blunted iron swords
3870	metamorphoses	 Achilles himself and the Greeks were marvelling at it, when Nestor said: ‘Cycnus has been the only one among your generation who ignored swords, and whom no blow could pierce
3871	metamorphoses	 But, long ago, I myself saw one Caeneus of Thessaly, who could take a thousand strokes with unwounded body: Thessalian Caeneus, I say, who, famous for his exploits, lived on Mount Othrys, and what made it more remarkable in him, he had been born a woman
3872	metamorphoses	’ All who there were interested by this strange wonder, and asked him to tell the story
3873	metamorphoses	Achilles, among the rest, said: ‘Say on, old one! O ancient eloquence, wisdom of our age, all of us equally desire to hear, who Caeneus was, why he was changed to his opposite, what campaign you met him in, fighting against whom, by whom he was overcome, if anyone overcame him
3874	metamorphoses	’ Then the old warrior said: ‘Though the slowness of age hampers me, and many things I once saw have slipped from me, I can still remember many
3875	metamorphoses	 Nothing sticks more firmly in my mind than this, amongst all those acts, in battle and at home, and if length of years alone enabled a man to report many deeds, I have lived two hundred years: now I live in my third century
3876	metamorphoses	Elatus’s daughter, Caenis, loveliest of the virgins of Thessaly, was famous for her beauty, a girl longed for in vain, the object of many suitors throughout the neighbouring cities and your own (since she was one of your people, Achilles)
3877	metamorphoses	 Perhaps Peleus also would have tried to wed her, but he had already taken your mother in marriage, or she was promised to your father
3878	metamorphoses	 Caenis would not agree to any marriage, but (so rumour has it) she was walking along a lonely beach, and the god took her by force
3879	metamorphoses	 When Neptune had enjoyed his new love he said: “Make your wish, without fear of refusal
3880	metamorphoses	 Ask for what you most want!” (The same rumour mentioned this
3881	metamorphoses	")
"
3882	metamorphoses	“This injury evokes the great desire never to be able to suffer any such again
3883	metamorphoses	 Grant I might not be a woman: you will have given me everything,” Caenis said
3884	metamorphoses	 She spoke the last words in a deeper tone that might have been the sound of a man’s voice
3885	metamorphoses	 So it was: the god of the deep ocean had already accepted her wish, and had granted, over and above it, that as a man Caeneus would be protected from all wounds, and never fall to the sword
3886	metamorphoses	 Caeneus, the Atracides, left, happy with his gifts, and spent his time in manly pastimes, roaming the Thessalian fields
3887	metamorphoses	"’
"
3888	metamorphoses	‘Pirithoüs, the daring son of Ixion, married Hippodame, and invited the cloud-born centaurs to take their place at tables, set in lines, in a tree-shaded cave
3889	metamorphoses	 Caeneus, and the other Thessalian princes were there, and I was there myself
3890	metamorphoses	 The festive palace echoed with the noisy crowd
3891	metamorphoses	 See, they were singing the marriage song, and the great hall smoked with fires, and in came the virgin surrounded by a throng of young wives and mothers, conspicuous, in her beauty
3892	metamorphoses	 We declared Pirithoüs to be blessed in his bride, which almost betrayed his good fortune
3893	metamorphoses	 For your heart was heated by the sight of the girl as much as by wine, Eurytus, most savage of the savage Centaurs: and drunkenness twinned with lust ruled it
3894	metamorphoses	At once the tables were overturned and the banquet in turmoil, and the new bride was grabbed by the hair and dragged off by force
3895	metamorphoses	 Eurytus seized Hippodame: the others whosoever they wished to, or could, and it looked like the rape of a city
3896	metamorphoses	 The palace sounded with women’s cries
3897	metamorphoses	 We all leaped up quickly, and Theseus, first, shouted out: ‘What foolishness drives you to this, Eurytus, that you challenge Pirithoüs in my presence, and unknowingly attack two in one? Lest his words were in vain, the brave hero pushed aside those threatening him, and rescued the girl from the madmen
3898	metamorphoses	 The other made no reply (since he could not defend his actions with words) but attacked her champion, with violent hands, striking at his face and noble chest
3899	metamorphoses	There chanced to be an ancient mixing-bowl nearby, embossed with raised designs, and Theseus raised the huge thing, he himself being huger, and threw it straight at Eurytus’s face
3900	metamorphoses	 He fell backwards, drumming his feet on the blood-soaked earth, gouts of blood spurting from mouth and wound equally, along with brain-matter and wine
3901	metamorphoses	 His twin-natured brothers, taking fire at his death, emulated each other, in shouting: ‘To arms! To arms!’ with a single voice
3902	metamorphoses	 Wine gave them courage, and, in the first battle, cups, fragile jars, and round basins were sent flying, things intended for feasting, now used for fighting and killing
3903	metamorphoses	"’
"
3904	metamorphoses	‘First, Amycus, son of Ophion, did not fear to despoil the inner shrine of its offerings, and snatched, first, from the sanctuary, a chandelier, thickly hung with gleaming lamps, and raising it on high, as one wields a sacrificial axe to break the bull’s snowy neck, he dashed it against the forehead of Celadon, the Lapith, leaving him with the bones of his face crushed past recognition
3905	metamorphoses	 His eyes leapt from their sockets, and his nose, pushed in, as the bones of his face shattered, was driven into his palate
3906	metamorphoses	 At this, Pelates of Pella, wrenching a leg from a maple-wood table, knocked Amycus to the ground, his chin driven into his chest: and his enemy sent him to the shadows of Tartarus with a second wound, as he spat out teeth, mixed with dark blood
3907	metamorphoses	Then Gryneus, standing near the smoking altar, gazing at it with wild eyes, shouted: “Why not put this to use?” and lifting the huge altar with its flames, he threw it into the midst of the crowd of Lapiths, crushing two of them, Broteas and Orios: Orios’s mother was Mycale, who was often known to draw down the horned moon by her incantations despite its struggles
3908	metamorphoses	 “You will not escape with impunity, if I can find a weapon
3909	metamorphoses	” said Exadius, who found the equivalent of a spear in a stag’s antlers that hung on a tall pine tree, as a votive offering
3910	metamorphoses	 Gryneus was pierced in the eyes by the twin branches, and his eyeballs gouged out, one of which stuck to the horn, and the other slipped down onto his beard, and hung there in a clot of blood
3911	metamorphoses	Then Rhoetus snatched up a burning brand from the altar, wood from a plum tree, and swinging it down from the right hand side, broke Charaxus’s temples protected by yellow hair
3912	metamorphoses	 The hair flared like a dry cornfield, set alight by the quick flames, and the blood seared in the wound gave out a terrible sizzling noise, as a bar of iron is prone to do, when the smith takes it, red-hot, from the fire, with curved tongs, and plunges it into a bath of water: it whistles and hisses immersed in the bubbling liquid
3913	metamorphoses	The wounded man shook the rapacious flames from his shaggy hair, and tearing a stone sill from the ground lifted it on his shoulders, a load for oxen, its very weight preventing him from hurling it as far as his enemy: but the mass of stone crushed his friend Cometes, who was standing nearer
3914	metamorphoses	 Rhoetus could not contain his delight, saying: “May the rest of the crowd on your side be as formidable as that!” and he renewed his attack with the half-burned branch, and with three or four heavy blows broke through the joints of his skull until the bones sank into the fluid brain
3915	metamorphoses	"’
"
3916	metamorphoses	‘The victor turned his attention to Euagrus, Corythus and Dryas
3917	metamorphoses	 When Corythus, one of these, fell, whose first downy hair covered his cheeks, Euagrus cried: “What glory is there on your part in shedding the blood of a boy?” Rhoetus stopped him from speaking, thrusting the fiery flames into the man’s open mouth, and down his throat
3918	metamorphoses	 He pursued you, also, savage Dryas, whirling the branch round his head, but with a different result
3919	metamorphoses	 As Rhoetus came on exulting in the succession of killings, you ran him through with a charred stake, where neck and shoulder meet
3920	metamorphoses	 Rhoetus groaned and with an effort wrenched the stake out of the solid bone: then he ran, drenched in his own blood
3921	metamorphoses	 Orneus and Lycabas, also ran; Medon, wounded in the right shoulder; Thaumas and Pisenor; and Mermeros who had recently overcome everyone by his fleetness of foot, and now ran more slowly from the wound he had suffered
3922	metamorphoses	 Pholus, Melaneus, and Abas the boar-hunter also fled, and Asbolus, the augur, who had vainly tried to dissuade them from fighting
3923	metamorphoses	 To Nessus, who also ran with him, fearful of being wounded, he said: “Do not flee! You are fated to be preserved for Hercules’s bow
3924	metamorphoses	” But Eurynomus, and Lycidas, Areos and Imbreus did not escape death: all these Dryas’s hand killed as they fronted him
3925	metamorphoses	 You also received a wound in front, Crenaeus, though you had turned your back in flight: as you looked back the heavy blade took you between the eyes, where nose and forehead meet
3926	metamorphoses	Aphidas lay amongst the intense noise, without waking, all his strength sunk in endless sleep, still holding a cup of mixed wine, in his limp hand, stretched out on the shaggy skin of a bear from Mount Ossa
3927	metamorphoses	 Phorbas caught sight of him at a distance, uselessly idle in the fight, and fitting his fingers into the strap of his javelin said: “Go drink your wine mixed with the waters of Styx
3928	metamorphoses	” Without hesitating he hurled his spear at the youth, and the ash shaft tipped with iron was driven through his neck, as he chanced to be lying with his head thrown back
3929	metamorphoses	 He did not feel death, and the black blood flowed from his welling throat, onto the couch and into the wine-cup itself
3930	metamorphoses	"’
"
3931	metamorphoses	‘I saw Petraeus trying to tear an oak-tree full of acorns from the ground
3932	metamorphoses	 While he had his arms round it, bending it this way and that, and shaking the loosened trunk, Pirithoüs sent a lance through his ribs, and pinned his writhing body to the hard wood
3933	metamorphoses	 They say that Lycus fell by Pirithoüs’s might, and Chromis by Pirithoüs’s might, but Dictys and Helops gave the victor a greater title to fame
3934	metamorphoses	 Helops was transfixed by a javelin that passed through both temples; hurled from the right and piercing the left ear
3935	metamorphoses	 Dictys, fleeing in desperate panic, pressed hard by Ixion’s son, stumbled on a mountain height, and fell headlong, breaking a huge flowering ash with the weight of his body, and entangling his entrails in the shattered tree
3936	metamorphoses	Aphareus was there, his avenger, who tried to hurl a rock torn from the mountainside: but as he tried Theseus, the son of Aegeus, caught him with his oaken club and broke the massive bones of his elbow
3937	metamorphoses	 Having neither time nor desire to inflict further injury on his worthless body, he leaped onto tall Bienor’s back, unused to carrying anything but its owner, and, pressing his knees into the centaur’s flanks, and clutching the mane with his left hand, he shattered the face, the mouth uttering threats, and the solid temples, with his knotted club
3938	metamorphoses	 With the club he overthrew Nedymnus, and Lycopes the javelin-thrower; Hippasos, his chest protected by a flowing beard, and Ripheus, who towered above the treetops; Thereus, also, who used to take bears on the mountain slopes of Thessaly, and carry them home angry and alive
3939	metamorphoses	Demoleon could no longer stand the success Theseus was enjoying: he had been trying, with great effort, to tear up the solid trunk of an ancient pine
3940	metamorphoses	 Unable to do it, he broke it off and hurled it at the enemy
3941	metamorphoses	 But Theseus drew well away from the oncoming missile, warned by Pallas, or so he would have us believe
3942	metamorphoses	 The tree trunk did not fall without effect, since it severed tall Crantor’s chest and left shoulder from the neck
3943	metamorphoses	 He was your father’s armour bearer, Achilles, whom Amyntor king of the Dolopians, having been defeated in battle, gave to Peleus, the Aeacides, as a true pledge of peace
3944	metamorphoses	When Peleus, some distance away, saw him torn apart by the frightful wound he shouted: “Accept this tribute to the dead, at least, Crantor, dearest of youths,” and with his powerful arm, he hurled his ash spear, at full strength, at Demoleon
3945	metamorphoses	 It ruptured the ribcage, and stuck quivering in the bone
3946	metamorphoses	 The centaur pulled out the shaft minus its head (he tried with difficulty to reach that also) but the head was caught in his lung
3947	metamorphoses	 The pain itself strengthened his will: wounded, he reared up at his enemy and beat the hero down with his hooves
3948	metamorphoses	 Peleus received the resounding blows on helmet and shield, and defending his upper arms, and controlling the weapon he held out, with one blow through the arm he pierced the bi-formed breast
3949	metamorphoses	Peleus had already, before this, killed Phlegraeos and Hyles, from a distance, and Iphinoüs and Clanis in close conflict
3950	metamorphoses	 He added Dorylas to these, who wore a wolfskin cap on his head, and instead of a deadly spear, carried a magnificent pair of crooked bull’s horns, dyed red with copious blood
3951	metamorphoses	I shouted to him (my courage giving me strength) “See how your horns give way before my spear” and I threw my javelin
3952	metamorphoses	 Since he could not evade it, he blocked a wound to his forehead with his right hand, and his hand was pinned to his forehead
3953	metamorphoses	 He screamed, but Peleus (as he stood near him) struck him with his sword in mid-stomach, as he came to a halt there, overcome by the harsh wound
3954	metamorphoses	 Dorylas leapt forward fiercely, dragging his guts on the ground, and as he dragged he trampled them, and as he trampled he tore them, entangled his legs in them, and fell, with emptied belly

3956	metamorphoses	‘Nor did your beauty, Cyllarus, if indeed we attribute beauty to your centaur race, save you in the fighting
3957	metamorphoses	His beard was beginning to show; a beard the colour of gold; and a golden mane fell from his shoulders half way down his flanks
3958	metamorphoses	 He had a liveliness of expression that was pleasing; his neck and shoulders, chest and hands, and all his human parts, you would praise as almost sculpted by an artist
3959	metamorphoses	 Nor was the equine part below marred, or inferior to the human: give him a horse’s head and neck and he would be worthy of a Castor, the back so fit for a rider, the deep chest so muscular
3960	metamorphoses	 He was blacker than pitch all over, except for a white tail, and legs also snow-white
3961	metamorphoses	Many females of his race courted him, but one, Hylonome, won him, none lovelier, among the female centaurs, in the deep forests
3962	metamorphoses	 She alone held Cyllarus’s affections, by endearments, by loving and admitting love; and by her appearance, as far as those limbs allow its cultivation: now she would smooth her mane with a comb, now entwine it with rosemary, now violets or roses: or else she wore bright lilies
3963	metamorphoses	 She bathed her face twice a day in the spring that fell from the woods, on the heights near Pagasae, twice dipped her body in the stream
3964	metamorphoses	 She would wear only selected skins of wild beasts that became her, over her shoulder or across her left flank
3965	metamorphoses	 Their love was equally shared
3966	metamorphoses	 They wandered the mountainsides together, rested at the same time in caves: and now they had both come to the palace of the Lapiths, and both fought fiercely
3967	metamorphoses	A javelin (who threw it is unknown) came from the left and took you, Cyllarus, below the place where the chest swells to the neck
3968	metamorphoses	 When the weapon was withdrawn the heart, though only slightly pierced, grew cold with the whole body
3969	metamorphoses	 Immediately Hylonome clasped the dying limbs, sealed the wound with her hand, placed her mouth on his, and tried to prevent the passage of his spirit
3970	metamorphoses	 Seeing he was dead, with words that the noise prevented from reaching my ears, she threw herself onto the spear that had pierced him, embracing her husband in dying

3972	metamorphoses	‘Still Phaeocomes stands before my eyes, he, who had tied six lion skins together with knotted cords, as a covering, protecting both man and horse
3973	metamorphoses	 Hurling a log, that two teams of oxen could hardly move, he crushed the skull-bone of Tectaphos, son of Olenus
3974	metamorphoses	 The broad dome of his head was shattered, and the soft brain matter oozed out through the hollow nostrils, eyes and ears, like curdled milk through the oak lattice, or as liquid trickles through a coarse sieve, under the weight, and squeezes thickly through the close mesh
3975	metamorphoses	 But even as Phaecomes prepared to strip the arms from the fallen man (your father knows this), I thrust my sword deep into the despoiler’s thigh
3976	metamorphoses	 Chthonius and Teleboas also fell to my sword: the first carried a forked branch, the other a spear: he gave me a wound with the spear - see, the scar! - the mark of the old wound is still visible
3977	metamorphoses	 In those days I would have been sent to capture Troy’s citadel; then, I could have entertained Hector greatly with my weapons, if not overcome him
3978	metamorphoses	 But Hector at that time was a child or not yet born, now my age has weakened me
3979	metamorphoses	What need to tell you how Periphas conquered dual-shaped Pyraethus? Why tell of Ampyx who drove his cornel-wood spear that had lost its tip into the opposing face of four-footed Echeclus? Macareus threw a crowbar at the chest of Pelethronian Erigdupus, killing him: and I remember how a hunting spear, from the hand of Nessus, buried itself in Cymelus’s groin
3980	metamorphoses	 Nor would you have thought Mopsus, Ampycus’s son, only prophesied the future: bi-formed Hodites fell to Mopsus’s throw, trying in vain to speak, his tongue fixed to the floor of his mouth, the floor of his mouth to his throat
3981	metamorphoses	Caeneus had killed five: Styphelos, Bromus, Antimachus, Elymus; and Pyracmos, who was armed with a battle-axe
3982	metamorphoses	 I do not recall their wounds, but I noted their number, and their names
3983	metamorphoses	 Then Latreus rushed forward, massive in body and limbs, armed with the spoils of Emathian Halesus whom he had killed
3984	metamorphoses	 He was between youth and age, but had the strength of youth, his hair greying on his temples
3985	metamorphoses	 Prancing in a circle, turning to face each of the battle-lines in turn, and conspicuous for his Macedonian lance, helmet and shield, he clashed his weapons, pouring out many proud words, into the empty air
3986	metamorphoses	 “Do I have to put up with you, Caenis? For you will always be a woman, Caenis, to me
3987	metamorphoses	 Does your natal origin not remind you; does not the act you were rewarded for come to mind, at what cost you gained this false aspect of a man? Consider what you were born as, or what you experienced, go, pick up your distaff and basket of wool and twist the spun thread with your thumb: leave war to men
3988	metamorphoses	"”
"
3989	metamorphoses	At this Caeneus threw his spear, ploughing a furrow in the centaur’s side, where man and horse joined, as he was stretched out in the act of galloping
3990	metamorphoses	 Maddened with pain, Latreus struck the Phylleian youth in his unprotected face, with the lance: but it bounced off like a hailstone from a rooftop, or a small pebble from a hollow drum
3991	metamorphoses	 Then he closed up on him, and tried to thrust his sword into his impenetrable side: the sword found no way in
3992	metamorphoses	 The centaur shouted: “You will still not escape! I will kill you with the sword’s edge if the point is blunt
3993	metamorphoses	” Turning his blade sideways he reached out for his enemy’s loins with his long right arm
3994	metamorphoses	 The blow resounded, as if it struck a body of marble, and the weapon fractured in pieces as it hit the firm flesh
3995	metamorphoses	When he had exposed his unwounded limbs for long enough to his wondering enemy, Caeneus said: “Now let me try your body with my blade!’ and he drove his fatal weapon into the other’s side, turning and twisting his hand, buried in the guts, causing wound on wound
3996	metamorphoses	 See, the centaurs maddened, rushed on him with a great shout, and all aimed and threw their spears at the one man
3997	metamorphoses	 The spears fell, blunted: and Caeneus, son of Elatus, remained unpierced and unbloodied by all their efforts
3998	metamorphoses	 This marvel astonished them
3999	metamorphoses	“Oh, what overwhelming shame!” Monychus exclaimed
4000	metamorphoses	 “A people defeated by one who is scarcely a man: yet he is the man, and we, with our half-hearted attempts are what he once was
4001	metamorphoses	 What use are our huge limbs? What use our twin powers, and that double nature uniting the strongest living things in us? We are not sons of a divine mother: nor of Ixion who was such as aspired to captivate great Juno: we are overcome by an enemy, who is half a man! Roll down rocks and tree trunks on him, and whole mountainsides, and crush that stubborn spirit with the forests we hurl! Let their mass constrict his throat, and let weight work instead of wounds
4002	metamorphoses	"”
"
4003	metamorphoses	He spoke, and finding a chance tree-trunk toppled by a furious southerly wind, he threw it at his powerful enemy
4004	metamorphoses	 He served as the example, and in a little while Mount Othrys was bare of trees, and Pelion had lost its shade
4005	metamorphoses	 Buried under the huge pile, Caeneus strained against the weight of trees, and propped up the mass of oak on his strong shoulders, but as it mounted above his mouth and face, he had no breath of the air that he breathed, and lacking it, often, he tried in vain to raise himself into the air, and throw off the forest piled on him, and often heaved, as if steep Mount Ida, that we see there, look, was shaken by an earthquake
4006	metamorphoses	His fate is doubtful: some said his body was thrust down to empty Tartarus, by the mass of forest: but Mopsus, the son of Ampycus denied this
4007	metamorphoses	 He saw a bird with tawny wings fly into the clear air from the midst of the pile, which I saw also, then, for the first and last time ever
4008	metamorphoses	 As Mopsus watched him smoothly circling his camp in flight, making a great noise, he pursued him with mind and vision, saying “Hail to you, Caeneus, glory of the race of Lapiths, once a great hero, but now a bird alone!” The thing was believed because of its author: grief was added to anger, and we could barely accept one man being conquered by so many enemies
4009	metamorphoses	 Nor did we cease to work off our pain with the sword until half were dead, and half, fleeing, were swallowed by the night
4010	metamorphoses	"’
"
4011	metamorphoses	As the hero from Pylos told of this battle between the Lapiths and the half-human Centaurs, Tlepolemus, son of Hercules, leader of the Rhodians, could not keep his mouth silent in his indignation at Hercules, the descendant of Alceus, being overlooked
4012	metamorphoses	 He said ‘Old man, it is amazing that your recital forgot to praise Hercules: certainly my father often used to tell me of the cloud-born centaurs he defeated
4013	metamorphoses	’ Nestor answered him, sternly
4014	metamorphoses	 ‘Why do you force me to remember wrongs, to re-open wounds healed by the years, and to reveal hatred for your father and the injuries he did me? He has done deeds beyond belief, the gods know, and filled the earth with his praises: that, I wish I could deny
4015	metamorphoses	" But we do not praise Deïphobus, or Polydamas, or Hector: who praises an enemy indeed?
"
4016	metamorphoses	That father of yours razed Messene’s walls; destroyed the innocent cities of Elis and Pylos, and overthrew my household gods with fire and sword
4017	metamorphoses	 I say nothing of the others he killed: there were twelve of us, sons of Neleus, outstanding young men, all except myself fell to Hercules’s strength
4018	metamorphoses	 We must accept that the others could be defeated: the death of Periclymenus was strange, whom Neptune, founder of Neleus’s bloodline, had granted the power to assume any form he wished and reverse that which he had assumed
4019	metamorphoses	 Now, after he had changed to every form in turn, he reverted to the shape of a bird, the eagle that carries the lightning bolts in its curved talons, beloved by the king of the gods
4020	metamorphoses	 He tore at the hero’s face with all the power of his wings, his hooked beak, and crooked claws
4021	metamorphoses	 Then, as he soared among the clouds, and hung poised there, the Tirynthian fired his unerring bow at him, and pierced him where the wing meets the side
4022	metamorphoses	The wound was not fatal, but the sinews, severed by the wound, failed, devoid of movement or power of flight
4023	metamorphoses	 He fell to earth, his weakened pinions not mastering the air, and the arrow, clinging lightly to the wing, was driven upwards with the body’s weight, and forced through the top of the breast into the left side of the throat
4024	metamorphoses	Now, O most glorious leader of the Rhodian fleet, do you think I should cry out your Hercules’s praises? Yet I look for no other revenge for my brothers than to be silent about his mighty deeds: there is unbroken friendship between you and me
4025	metamorphoses	"’
"
4026	metamorphoses	When Nestor had told his tale in a pleasant voice, passing from the old man’s story to the gifts of Bacchus again, they rose from the couches: the rest of the night was given to sleep
4027	metamorphoses	But the god of the trident, who rules the ocean waters, grieved, with a father’s feelings, for the son changed into a swan, the bird of Phaethon, and, hating fierce Achilles, he nursed an excessive anger in his memory
4028	metamorphoses	And now, when the war against Troy had lasted for almost ten years, he called to Sminthean Apollo, the unshorn, in these words: ‘O, by far the best loved of my brother’s sons, who built the walls of Troy with me, to no purpose, do you sigh at all to see these battlements at the moment of their destruction? Do you grieve at all that so many thousands died defending her walls? Not to name all of them, does not the shade come before you of Hector, dragged round his own citadel, Pergama? But savage Achilles, crueller than war itself, is still alive, ravager of our creation
4029	metamorphoses	 Let him be given up to me
4030	metamorphoses	" I would let him feel what I can do with my three-pronged spear: but since I am not allowed to meet face to face with the enemy, destroy him unexpectedly with a hidden arrow!’
"
4031	metamorphoses	The Delian god nodded, and satisfying his own and his uncle’s desire, he came to the Trojan lines, wrapped in a cloud, and there, among human massacre, he saw Paris firing infrequent shafts at unknown Greeks
4032	metamorphoses	 Showing himself as a god, he said: ‘Why waste your arrows on the blood of the rank and file? If you care for your own, aim at Achilles, grandson of Aeacus, and avenge your dead brothers!’ He spoke, and, pointing to Pelides, who, with his weapon, was strewing the ground with Trojan bodies, he turned Paris’s bow towards him, and guided the unerring shaft with deadly hand
4033	metamorphoses	 This was the one thing that could delight old Priam since Hector’s death
4034	metamorphoses	So, Achilles, conqueror of so much greatness, you are conquered, by the cowardly thief of the wife of a Greek! If your death had to be by a woman’s hand, in war, you would rather have fallen to an Amazon’s two-edged axe
4035	metamorphoses	Now Achilles, grandson of Aeacus, the terror of the Phrygians, the glory and defence of the Pelasgian name, the invincible captain in battle, was burned: one god, Vulcan, armed him, and that same god consumed him
4036	metamorphoses	 Now he is ash, and little if anything remains of Achilles, once so mighty, hardly enough to fill an urn
4037	metamorphoses	 But his fame lives, enough to fill a world
4038	metamorphoses	 That equals the measure of the man, and, in that, the son of Peleus is truly himself, and does not know the void of Tartarus
4039	metamorphoses	So that you might know whose it was, even his shield makes war: and arms, for his arms, are raised
4040	metamorphoses	 Diomede, son of Tydeus, and the lesser Ajax, Oileus’s son, dare not claim them, nor the younger son of Atreus, Menelaüs, nor the elder, Agamemnon, greater in warfare, nor the rest
4041	metamorphoses	 Only Ajax, the son of Telamon, and Ulysses, Laërtes’s son, were confident enough for such glory
4042	metamorphoses	 Agamemnon, the descendant of Tantalus, in order to escape the invidious burden of choosing between them, ordered the leaders of the Greeks to meet in the middle of the camp, and he transferred judgement of the dispute to them all
4043	metamorphoses	When the captains were seated, and the rank and file were standing, in a circle, around them, Ajax, master of the seven-layered shield, leapt up, and, fired with indignation, he looked back fiercely at the Sigean shore, and the ships beached on the shore, and, pointing to them, he said: ‘It is in front of these vessels I plead my cause, and Ulysses opposes me, by Jupiter! Yet he did not hesitate to give way before Hector’s blazing torches, which I resisted, which I drove away from the boats
4044	metamorphoses	 But then, it is less risky to battle using lying words, than to fight with fists, and I am not prompt to speak, as he is not to act
4045	metamorphoses	 I am as powerful in the fierce conflicts of the battle, as that man is in talk
4046	metamorphoses	 I do not think however that I need to mention my deeds to you, Pelasgians, since you have seen them: let Ulysses tell you of his that are conducted without witness, in which night is the only sharer! I confess the prize I seek is great: but my rival detracts from the honour of it
4047	metamorphoses	 There is nothing magnificent for Ajax in it, however great the thing is, if Ulysses has aspired to it
4048	metamorphoses	 He has already won the prize in this contest, since when he is defeated he can say he fought it out with me
4049	metamorphoses	As for me, if my courage were in doubt, my noble birth is a powerful argument, a son of Telamon, he who, under brave Hercules, captured the walls of Troy, and sailed in the ship from Pagasae, with the Argonauts, to Colchis
4050	metamorphoses	 Telamon’s father was Aeacus, who judges there, among the silent dead, where Sisyphus, son of Aeolus rolls his heavy stone
4051	metamorphoses	 Lofty Jupiter acknowledges Aeacus and confesses him to be his son: so Ajax is third in descent from Jove
4052	metamorphoses	 Yet even this ancestry would not further my cause, if I did not share it with great Achilles
4053	metamorphoses	" Our fathers, Peleus and Aeacus, were brothers: Achilles was my cousin, I ask for my cousin’s weapons! Why are you, Ulysses, the son of Sisyphus, and similar to him in your capability for fraud and trickery, involving an alien race in the affairs of the Aeacidae?
"
4054	metamorphoses	Are the arms denied me because I took up arms first, and without being rooted out, and shall he seem the better man who seized his weapons last, and shirked the fight with a pretence of madness, until Palamades, son of Nauplius, the shrewder man, uncovered this cowardly spirit’s deceit, and dragged him to the weapons he shunned? Shall he own all, who wanted none: shall I, who was the first to put myself at risk, be denied honour, and my cousin’s gifts? If only his madness had been real, or been believed, and this exhorter to crime had never been our companion against the Phrygian fortresses! Then Lemnos would not hold you, to our shame, Philoctetes, son of Poeas, of whom they say that, hidden in the woodland caves, you move the stones, now, with your laments, calling down on Laërtes’s son the curses that he deserves, and, if there are gods, do not curse in vain! Now, alas, he who was sworn to the same conflict as ourselves, one of our captains, heir to Hercules’s arrows, weakened by sickness and hunger, clothed and fed by the birds, employs the arrows, that fate intended for Troy, in firing at birds! Still, he is alive, because he did not accompany Ulysses further: luckless Palamades would have preferred to be left behind also: he would have been alive, or at least have died an irreproachable death: that man there, remembering all too well the exposure of his own supposed madness, accused him of betraying the Greek cause, and uncovered gold, he had previously hidden, as evidence of the fabricated charge
4055	metamorphoses	" So, by abandonment or death, he has drawn the strength of Achaea: that is how Ulysses fights, that is why he is to be feared!
"
4056	metamorphoses	Though he be greater than Nestor, the true, in eloquence, I will never believe that his desertion of Nestor in battle was anything but a crime
4057	metamorphoses	 When Nestor implored Ulysses’s help, weary as he was with old age, and slowed by a wound to his horse, he was abandoned by his companion
4058	metamorphoses	 Diomede, son of Tydeus, is well aware that I am not inventing the charge: he called Ulysses repeatedly, by name, and reproached his cowardly friend for running away
4059	metamorphoses	The gods look down, with the eyes of the just, at human dealings! Look, he who gave no help needs it: and as he had abandoned Nestor, so he would have been abandoned: he himself had established his own precedent
4060	metamorphoses	 He shouted to his companions
4061	metamorphoses	 I approached, and saw him, trembling and pale, and shaking with fear of impending death
4062	metamorphoses	 I thrust out the mass of my shield, and covered him as he lay there, and (small cause for praise in that) I saved his cowardly life
4063	metamorphoses	 If you go through with this contest, let us revisit that spot: revisit the enemy, your wound, and your usual cowardice, hide behind my shield, and contend with me under it! Yet, after I had snatched him up, he who was granted no strength to stand, because of his wounds, ran for it, not slowed by his wounds at all
4064	metamorphoses	Hector approaches, and, with him, leads the gods to battle, and brave men as well as you are terrified, Ulysses, when he rushes onwards, such is the fear he brings
4065	metamorphoses	 I felled him to the ground with a huge rock hurled from a distance, as he was exulting in the success of his bloodthirsty slaughter
4066	metamorphoses	 When he challenged one warrior to meet him, I withstood him
4067	metamorphoses	 You wished the lot would fall to me, Achaeans, and your prayers were answered
4068	metamorphoses	 If you ask what the outcome of that conflict was I was not beaten by Hector
4069	metamorphoses	 See, the Trojans bring fire and sword, and Jupiter himself, against the Greek ships: where now is the eloquent Ulysses? Surely I, with my own breast, shielded the thousand ships, your hope of return: grant me the arms for all that fleet
4070	metamorphoses	Yet, if I may speak the truth, the arms search for greater honour than I do, to be linked to my glory, and the arms seek out Ajax, not Ajax the arms
4071	metamorphoses	 Let the Ithacan compare with these things his killing of Rhesus, and of cowardly Dolon, his taking captive Helenus, Priam’s son, and his theft of Pallas’s image, the Palladium: nothing performed in daylight, nothing without Diomede present
4072	metamorphoses	 If ever you grant the armour for such worthless service, divide it, and let Diomede have the greater share of it
4073	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless why give them to the Ithacan, who carries things out secretly, and always unarmed, deceiving the unsuspecting enemy with his tricks? The gleam of the helmet, radiant with shining gold, will reveal his scheming, and show where he hides
4074	metamorphoses	 The Dulichian’s head beneath Achilles’s helmet, will not bear so great a weight, and the spear-shaft, from Pelion, cannot be anything but heavy and burdensome for his arm, unsuited to war, and the shield, with its engraved design of the vast world, will not be fit for that cowardly left hand born for stealing
4075	metamorphoses	 Perverse man, why do you go after a prize that will cripple you, one that, if it is given you in error by the Achaean people, will be a reason for being despoiled by the enemy, not feared by them? And running away, in which you surpass everyone, you master-coward, will turn out to be a slow game for you, if you are carrying such a weight
4076	metamorphoses	 Add to that your shield that is rarely used in battle, and uninjured, and mine split in a thousand places from fending off spear-thrusts, that needs a new successor
4077	metamorphoses	Finally (what is the use of words?) let us be seen together in action! Send out the brave hero’s arms into the middle of the enemy ranks: order them to be recovered from there, and let the retriever be equipped with what he retrieves
4078	metamorphoses	"’
"
4079	metamorphoses	The son of Telamon finished, and the crowd’s applause followed his closing words
4080	metamorphoses	 Until the hero, son of Laërtes, stood
4081	metamorphoses	 He gazed at the ground for a while and then raised his eyes to look at the captains, and opened his lips for the speech they anticipated: his eloquent words did not lack grace in their delivery
4082	metamorphoses	‘If my wishes and yours, Pelasgians, had been worth anything, there would be no question as to who should inherit the arms in this great contest: you, Achilles, would have your armour, and we would have you
4083	metamorphoses	 But since unequal fate has denied his presence to me and to you, (and he made as if to wipe a tear from his eye), who better to take Achilles’s place than the man through whom mighty Achilles took his place among the Greeks? Only do not let it help him that he is slow-witted, as he seems to be, nor harm my case that my ability has always profited you Greeks
4084	metamorphoses	 And let this eloquence of mine, if it exists, that often spoke for you, and now speaks for its master, escape envy: no man should refuse to employ his talents
4085	metamorphoses	Now, as to race, and ancestry, and whatever we have not personally achieved; I hardly call those things ours
4086	metamorphoses	 But since Ajax has recalled that he is Jove’s great grandson, Jupiter is the founder of my bloodline also, and I am the same distance from him
4087	metamorphoses	 Laërtes is my father, Arcesius was Laërtes’s father, and he was the son of Jupiter: and there are no exiled criminals, like Peleus and Telamon, amongst them
4088	metamorphoses	 Also there is the addition to my nobility of Cyllenian Mercury through my mother, Anticleia
4089	metamorphoses	 The gods are in both my parents
4090	metamorphoses	 But I do not claim the arms lying there because I am nobler on my mother’s side, nor because my father is innocent of a brother’s blood
4091	metamorphoses	 Judge the case on its merits
4092	metamorphoses	 Provided that it is not regarded as Ajax’s merit that Telamon and Peleus were brothers, and that what is considered in this award is respect for ability not the claims of blood! Or, if you are asking who is the next of kin, and the lawful heir, well Peleus is Achilles’s father, and Pyrrhus is Achilles’s son: where is Ajax’s claim? Take the arms to Peleus’s Phthia, or Pyrrhus’s Scyros! Teucer is no less Achilles’s cousin than Ajax, yet does he ask for the arms, and if he did, would he gain them? So, since it is a contest about naked achievements, I have done more than I can recount in glib words, but I will take things in their proper order
4093	metamorphoses	Thetis, Achilles’s Nereid mother, foreseeing her son’s death, disguised his appearance, and wearing women’s clothes he deceived everyone, including Ajax
4094	metamorphoses	 But, among the things women buy, I placed arms to stir a man’s spirit
4095	metamorphoses	 Before the hero had abandoned the clothes of a girl, while he held the shield and spear, I said: ‘Pergama the citadel doomed to be destroyed, waits for you, son of the goddess! Why do you hesitate to overthrow mighty Troy?’ And I took him in hand, and sent the brave out to do brave things
4096	metamorphoses	 So his deeds are mine: I overcame warring Telephus with my spear, and healed him with it, when he was defeated and begging for help
4097	metamorphoses	 It is down to me that Mysian Thebes fell: credit the capture of Lesbos to me, Tenedos to me, Chryse and Cilla the cities of Apollo, and Phrygian Scyros as well
4098	metamorphoses	 Imagine that my right hand razed Lyrnesus’s walls to the ground
4099	metamorphoses	 I gave you the man who could destroy fierce Hector, not to speak of those other Trojans: through me glorious Hector lies low! I seek these arms for the arms that revealed Achilles: I gave to the living, I claim from the dead
4100	metamorphoses	When one man’s sorrow fell on all the Greeks, and a thousand ships gathered at Euboean Aulis, though they waited for a long time, there were adverse winds or no wind
4101	metamorphoses	 Then a cruel oracle ordered Agamemnon to sacrifice his innocent daughter, Iphigenia, to pitiless Diana
4102	metamorphoses	 The father said no, angered with the gods themselves: and there is still a father even in a king
4103	metamorphoses	 I with my skill in words turned him away from a parent’s fondness and towards the common good
4104	metamorphoses	 I had a difficult case indeed to plead, before (I confess, and may Atrides pardon the confession) a prejudiced judge, but given the needs of his brother and the expedition, and the high command vested in him, he balanced glory against blood
4105	metamorphoses	 Then I was sent to the mother, Clytaemnestra, who was not to be persuaded, but deceived by cunning
4106	metamorphoses	 If Telamon’s son had gone, our sails would still be waiting for the winds
4107	metamorphoses	Also, as an ambassador, I was sent to Troy’s citadel, and saw and entered the senate house of lofty Ilium, still full of heroes
4108	metamorphoses	 As I was charged to do by Greece, for the common good, undaunted, I accused Paris, demanded the return of Helen and what Paris had plundered, and stirred Priam, and Antenor, at one with Priam
4109	metamorphoses	 But Paris, and his brothers, and those who plundered with him, could scarcely keep their sinful hands off me (you know it, Menelaüs) and that first day of danger to me was shared with you
4110	metamorphoses	It would take a long time to tell what I have achieved that has been useful, by stratagem and deed, in the long space of this conflict
4111	metamorphoses	 After the first onslaught the enemy kept inside the city walls for a long time, and there was no chance for open warfare
4112	metamorphoses	 Finally in the tenth year we fought it out
4113	metamorphoses	 What were you doing meanwhile, Ajax, you who only know about battles? What use were you then? If you ask what I was doing, I laid ambushes for the enemy; surrounded the defences with a ditch; encouraged our allies so that they might bear the weariness of a long campaign with patience of mind; advised on how we should be fed and armed; was sent wherever benefit required it
4114	metamorphoses	See, deceived by a dream in sleep, Agamemnon, the king, commanded by Jupiter, orders us to give up all concern with the war we have begun
4115	metamorphoses	 He can justify his words by this dream’s authority
4116	metamorphoses	" Let Ajax prevent it, and demand that the citadel, Pergama, be destroyed, let him do what he can do, fight! Why does he not restrain those who are for returning home? Why does he not take up arms, and give a lead for the fickle mob to follow?
"
4117	metamorphoses	"That was not too much to ask of one who never speaks without boasting: but what of the fact that he fled as well?
"
4118	metamorphoses	I saw you, Ajax, and was ashamed to see it, when, turning your back, you readied your dishonourable sails
4119	metamorphoses	 Instantly I shouted: ‘What are you doing? What madness is urging you to abandon captured Troy? What are you taking home with you, except disgrace?’ With these words, and others, in which my anguish made me eloquent, I turned men from their flight, and led them back
4120	metamorphoses	 Atrides assembled the allies who were quaking with fear: even then the son of Telamon did not dare utter a thing, but even Thersites dared to attack the kings with insolent words, though not without punishment from me! I rose to my feet and urged on my frightened countrymen against the enemy, and by my voice restored their lost courage
4121	metamorphoses	 From that time on, whatever bravery this man can be seen to have shown, is mine, who dragged him back when he was given to flight
4122	metamorphoses	Next, which of the Greeks praises you or seeks you out, Ajax? Yet Diomede shares what he does with me, supports me, and always trusts Ulysses as his companion
4123	metamorphoses	 That is something, to be singled out by Diomede from so many thousand Greeks! No drawing of lots forced me to go: yet, disregarding the dangers of night and the enemy, I killed Dolon, the Phrygian, out on the same errand as we were, but not before I had forced him to tell what he knew, and had learned what perfidious Troy was planning
4124	metamorphoses	 I had discovered everything, and had no need to spy further, and could now return with the glory I sought: yet not content with that, I searched out Rhesus’s tents, and I killed him and his comrades in their camp
4125	metamorphoses	 And so, a victor, with what I prayed for achieved, as if it were a triumph, I rode his captured chariot
4126	metamorphoses	 Deny me the arms of Achilles, whose horses my enemy, Dolon, asked of Hector, for his night’s work, and let Ajax be more generous than you
4127	metamorphoses	Why should I have to mention the ranks of Sarpedon of Lycia cut to pieces by my sword? With bloody slaughter I killed Coeranos, Iphitus’s son; Alastor and Chromius; Alcander, Halius, Noëmon and Prytanis; and I dealt destruction to Thoön, Chersidamas, Charopes, and Ennomos driven by inexorable fate; and others less well known fell to my hand under the walls of the city
4128	metamorphoses	" I have wounds, friends, honourable ones, as their position shows: do not believe empty words, look!’ and he pulled his tunic open with his hand, ‘here is my breast that has always been employed in your actions! But the son of Telamon has shed no blood for his companions, in all these years, and his flesh is unwounded!
"
4129	metamorphoses	What relevance is it that he declares he took up arms against the Trojans and against Jove? I agree, he did (since I do not maliciously disparage beneficial actions) but do not let him seize the honour that is shared, and let him grant you some respect also
4130	metamorphoses	 It was Patroclus, son of Actor, protected by being disguised in Achilles’s armour, who pushed back the Trojans from the ships that would have gone up in flames, with Ajax, their defender
4131	metamorphoses	 He thinks that he is the only one who dared to face Hector’s spear, forgetting the captains and the king, and myself: he was the ninth to volunteer, and selected by the luck of the draw
4132	metamorphoses	 But what was the result of your struggle, strongest of men? Hector retreated without receiving a single wound
4133	metamorphoses	Alas, with what sadness I am forced to recall that time when Achilles, the defence of Achaia, fell! Yet tears, grief, fear did not prevent my lifting his body from the earth: I carried the body of Achilles over these shoulders, these very shoulders, along with the weapons, that now also I am anxious to carry
4134	metamorphoses	 I have strength enough for such a burden, and a mind that can surely appreciate the honour
4135	metamorphoses	 Was it for this that his mother, the sea-goddess, was so ambitious for her son, that the gifts of heaven, the works of such artistry, should adorn an ignorant and thoughtless soldier? He understands nothing of the shield’s engraving, Ocean, or earth, or high starry sky; the Pleiades and the Hyades, the Bear that is always clear of the waters, and opposite, beyond the Milky Way, Orion, with his glittering sword
4136	metamorphoses	" He demands to bear armour that he does not comprehend!
"
4137	metamorphoses	What of the fact that he accuses me of shirking the harsh duties of war, and of coming late to a labour already begun? Does he not see that he is speaking ill of great Achilles? If you call it a crime to dissimulate, we both dissimulated: if delay is a fault, I was the earlier to arrive
4138	metamorphoses	 A loving wife detained me, a loving mother Achilles
4139	metamorphoses	 Our priority was given to them, the rest to you
4140	metamorphoses	 I hardly fear an accusation, even if I cannot defend myself against it, shared with such a man: he was revealed by Ulysses’s cunning, but not Ulysses by Ajax’s
4141	metamorphoses	Let us not be astonished that he pours out against me the invective from his foolish tongue, since he reproaches you shamefully
4142	metamorphoses	 Was it a disgrace for me to accuse Palamades on an erroneous charge, but proper for you to condemn him? But then the son of Nauplias could not defend himself against so great a crime, and one so clearly proven: nor did you merely hear of the crime: you saw it, revealed by the gold I exposed
4143	metamorphoses	Nor do I merit being called a criminal because Lemnos, Vulcan’s isle, holds the son of Poeas, Philoctetes, (defend your own actions, since you agreed to it!) but I will not deny that I persuaded him to withdraw from the hardships of war and the journey, and to try and relieve his terrible agonies in rest
4144	metamorphoses	 He agreed – and he still lives! Not only was my opinion offered in good faith, though it is enough that it was in good faith, but it turned out well
4145	metamorphoses	 Now since our seers demand his presence for the destruction of Troy, do not commission me! Telamon’s son, with his eloquence, had better go and soothe that man, maddened by pain and fury, or bring him by some cunning trick! If my mind were idle on your behalf, the River Simoïs would flow backwards, and Mount Ida stand there leafless, and Achaia help Pergama, before the skill, of foolish Ajax, would benefit the Greeks
4146	metamorphoses	I would go to you, harsh Philoctetes, and try to bring you back with me, though you are aggressive towards king and countrymen, and myself; though you execrate me, and pour curses endlessly on my head; and, in your pain, long for me to be given into your power, to drink my blood, and to have your chance at me, as I did at you
4147	metamorphoses	 And I would gain possession of your arrows (by Fortune’s favour), as I took possession of the Dardanian seer, Helenus, whom I captured; as I revealed the gods’ oracles and the fate of Troy; as I stole the image of Phrygian Minerva from the inner sanctuary, from the midst of the enemy
4148	metamorphoses	 Does Ajax compare himself to me? The fates surely denied our capturing Troy without it
4149	metamorphoses	Where is brave Ajax now? Where are the great hero’s mighty words? What do you fear then? Why does Ulysses dare to go through the sentries and commit himself to night; to enter not only the walls of Troy but also the heights of the citadel, past the sharp swords; and to snatch the goddess from her temple, and carry her captive through the enemy ranks? If I had not done it, the son of Telamon would have carried the seven-layered bull’s-hide shield on his left arm in vain
4150	metamorphoses	 That night the victory over Troy was established: I defeated Pergama then, when I secured the possibility of her defeat
4151	metamorphoses	You can stop pointing out with your murmurs and looks, Ajax, that Diomede was my partner: he has his share of praise in this! Nor were you alone, when you held your shield in defence of the allied ships: you had a crowd of companions: I had only one
4152	metamorphoses	 If he did not know that a fighter is worth less than a thinker, and that the prize is not owed merely because of an indomitable right hand, he would also claim it; so would the lesser Ajax, fierce Eurypylus, and Thoas, the son of famous Andraemon, and no less surely would Idomeneus, and Meriones born of the same nation, and Menelaüs, the brother of Agamemnon
4153	metamorphoses	In fact, they accept my counsel, these strong right hands, not second to me in battle
4154	metamorphoses	 Your right hand, useful in war, needs the guidance of my intellect
4155	metamorphoses	 You have power without mind, mine is the care for the future
4156	metamorphoses	 You can fight, but Atrides, with me, chooses the time to fight
4157	metamorphoses	 You only display the flesh, I the spirit
4158	metamorphoses	 By as much as he who steers the ship is superior to him who rows, by as much as the general exceeds the soldier, by that much I surpass you
4159	metamorphoses	 No less is the head more powerful than the hand, in our body: the energy of the whole is within it
4160	metamorphoses	O princes, grant the prize to your sentry, for the many years I have spent in anxious care, grant me the judgement, this honour for my services
4161	metamorphoses	 Now my labour is done: I have removed fate’s obstacles, and by making it possible to take high Pergama, have taken her
4162	metamorphoses	 Now, by our common expectation; by Troy’s doomed walls; by the gods I recently took from the enemy; by whatever else remains that needs to be done wisely; I pray, that if there is still some bold and dangerous thing to attempt, if you think that anything is yet in store involving Troy’s fate, remember me! And if you do not give me the arms, give them to her!’ and he pointed towards Minerva’s fatal statue
4163	metamorphoses	The council of princes was swayed, and it shows what eloquence can do: the gifted speaker carried away the arms of the brave hero
4164	metamorphoses	 But Ajax, who had so often stood alone against Hector, against sword and flame, against Jove himself, could not stand against mere passion, and indignation conquered the unconquerable hero
4165	metamorphoses	 Drawing his sword he shouted: ‘This is mine, at least! Or does Ulysses demand it for himself? This I will use myself, on myself, and the iron so often drenched in Phrygian blood, will now be drenched in its master’s, so that none can defeat Ajax but himself
4166	metamorphoses	’ He spoke, and drove the lethal weapon to its full extent into his chest, that, till then, had never felt a wound
4167	metamorphoses	 No hand was strong enough to draw out the implanted weapon: it was the blood itself expelled it, and the bloodstained ground bore a purple flower from the green turf, that had first sprung from the wound of the Spartan, Hyacinthus
4168	metamorphoses	 In the centre of the petals letters are inscribed, shared by the hero and the boy, one reading of them being a name, ΑΙΑΣ, and the other one, ΑΙ ΑΙ, a cry of woe
4169	metamorphoses	Ulysses, the winner, set sail for Lemnos, the island of Queen Hypsipyle and her father the famous Thoas, a country notorious in ancient times for the murder by its women of their men, to bring back the arrows of Tyrinthian Hercules
4170	metamorphoses	 When he had brought them back to the Greeks, with Philoctetes their master, the last hand was dealt in the long drawn-out war
4171	metamorphoses	 Troy fell, and Priam also
4172	metamorphoses	 Hecuba, Priam’s unhappy wife, when all else was lost, lost her human form, and filled the air of an alien country, where the long Hellespont narrows to a strait, with strange barking
4173	metamorphoses	Ilium burned; the flames had not yet died down; Jove’s altar was soaking up old Priam’s meagre stream of blood; and Cassandra, the head priestess of Apollo, dragged along by her hair, stretched out her arms uselessly to the heavens
4174	metamorphoses	 The Dardanian women, embracing the statues of their nation’s gods while they still could, and thronging the burning temples, were snatched away by the victorious Greeks as enviable prizes
4175	metamorphoses	 Astyanax, was thrown down from that tower, from which he used to see his father, Hector, whom Andromache his mother pointed out to him, as Hector fought for him, and protected the ancestral kingdom
4176	metamorphoses	 Now Boreas, the north wind, urged the Greeks on their way, and the sails flapped in a favourable breeze
4177	metamorphoses	The sailers are ordered to take advantage of the wind
4178	metamorphoses	 The Trojan women wail, kissing their native earth, abandoning the burning houses: ‘Troy, farewell! We are taken against our will
4179	metamorphoses	"’
"
4180	metamorphoses	The last to embark – pitiable sight! – was Hecuba, found among the tombs of her sons
4181	metamorphoses	 There as she clung to their graves, trying to kiss their relics, the hands of Dulichian Ulysses dragged her away
4182	metamorphoses	 Yet she emptied one sepulchre, and carried away with her, at her breast, Hector’s ashes from the emptied urn
4183	metamorphoses	 And on Hector’s grave she left a scant offering to the dead, shreds of her grey hair, hair and tears
4184	metamorphoses	There is a country opposite Phrygia, where Troy stood, that the Bistones inhabit: Polymestor’s wealthy court was there, to whom Priam your father secretly sent you, Polydorus, to be reared away from the Phrygian war: a wise plan if he had not sent great riches with you, a reward for the criminal, a temptation to the greedy spirit
4185	metamorphoses	 When Phrygia’s fortunes waned, the impious king of Thrace took his sword and stabbed his young foster child in the throat, and threw the body from a cliff into the sea, as if murder could be eliminated with the corpse
4186	metamorphoses	Agamemnon had moored his fleet on a Thracian beach until the sea calmed, and the winds were kinder
4187	metamorphoses	 Here, suddenly the ghost of Achilles appeared from a broad fissure in the earth, as large as he used to be in life
4188	metamorphoses	 He appeared as on the day when, with threatening face, and sword in hand, he fiercely challenged Agamemnon’s injustice
4189	metamorphoses	 ‘You depart, then, Achaeans, forgetting me, and gratitude for my courage is buried with me!’ he cried, ‘Do not let it be so! Let Polyxena be sacrificed, so that my tomb is not without its honours
4190	metamorphoses	" Appease Achilles’s shade!’
"
4191	metamorphoses	He spoke, and, his countrymen obeyed the pitiless ghost
4192	metamorphoses	 Now, she was torn from her mother’s arms, and the girl, almost Hecuba’s only comfort, ill-fated, but with more than a woman’s courage, was led to the burial mound and became a victim of the dread grave
4193	metamorphoses	 She remembered who she was, set before the brutal altar, knowing the savage rite was readied for her, and when she saw Neoptolemus standing, gripping his sword, his eyes gazing at her face, she said: ‘Now, shed noble blood, nothing prevents you: but sheathe your sword in my throat or in my breast,’ and she uncovered both her throat and her breast, ‘Polyxena, for certain, has no desire to be slave to any man! No god will be appeased by such a rite as this! I only wish my death could be unknown to my mother: my mother weakens and lessens my joy in death, though it is not my dying but her living that is terrible
4194	metamorphoses	 Now, move away, you, so that if my request is lawful, I may not be hindered in going to the Stygian shades: and take the hands of man from virgin flesh! My free blood will be more acceptable to him, whoever he is, whom you are trying to appease with my murder
4195	metamorphoses	" If my last words still move any of you (The daughter of Priam asks it, not a prisoner) return my body to my mother without ransom: let her pay for the sad privilege of burying me, not with gold, but with tears! When she could do so, she paid in gold as well’
"
4196	metamorphoses	She spoke, and the crowd could not restrain tears that she restrained
4197	metamorphoses	 Then the priest, also weeping, and against his will, driving his sword home, pierced the breast she offered up
4198	metamorphoses	 Her knees gave way, and she sank to the ground, keeping her look of fearless courage to the end
4199	metamorphoses	 Even then, as she fell, she was careful to hide the parts that should be hidden, and to protect the honour of her chaste modesty
4200	metamorphoses	The Trojan women lift her body, counting over the lamented children of Priam, and recounting how much blood one house has surrendered
4201	metamorphoses	" They weep for you, girl, and for you, Hecuba, who were lately called the royal wife, the royal parent, the image of bright Asia, now in evil circumstances, even for a prisoner, whom victorious Ulysses would not have wanted, except for the fact that you had given birth to Hector: a partner for his mother that Hector would scarcely have imagined!
"
4202	metamorphoses	Embracing the body of Polyxena, now empty of that brave spirit, she sheds the tears for her that she has shed so often for her husband, sons and country
4203	metamorphoses	 She pours her tears over her daughter’s wound, covers her lips with kisses, and beats at her own bruised breast
4204	metamorphoses	Then, tearing at her white hair caked with blood, and plucking at her breast, she said this amongst other things: ‘Child – since, what else is left me? – your mother’s last grief, Child, you lie there, and I see your wound, that is my wound
4205	metamorphoses	 Look, you also have your wound, so that I might lose none of my children without bloodshed
4206	metamorphoses	 Because you were a woman, I thought you safe from the sword: yet, a woman, you have died by the sword: and that same Achilles who has ruined Troy and made me childless, who has destroyed so many of your brothers, has killed you in the same way
4207	metamorphoses	Yet when he fell to the arrow of Paris, and Phoebus, I said: “Now surely, Achilles is no longer to be feared
4208	metamorphoses	” Yet even then I still needed to fear him
4209	metamorphoses	 His very ashes in the tomb are hostile to our race: even in the grave we feel his enmity: I gave birth for the Aeacidae! Mighty Ilium is in the dust, and, in a grievous outcome, our ruined State is ended
4210	metamorphoses	 But still, it ended: in me, only, Pergama remains
4211	metamorphoses	 My grief still takes it course
4212	metamorphoses	 A moment ago I was endowed with the greatest things, so many sons and daughters, sons-in-law, and daughters-in-law, and my husband
4213	metamorphoses	 Now, exiled, destitute, torn from the tombs of my loved ones, I am dragged off as a prize, to serve Penelope
4214	metamorphoses	 She will point me out to the women of Ithaca, as I spin the wool she gives me, and say: “This is the famous mother of Hector, this is Priam’s queen
4215	metamorphoses	"” Now you, Polyxena, after so many have been lost, you, who were the only one left to comfort your mother’s grief, have been sacrificed on an enemy tomb! I have borne offerings for the enemy dead!
"
4216	metamorphoses	Why do I remain, unyielding? Why do I linger here? Why do you preserve me, wrinkled old age? Why prolong an old woman’s life, cruel gods, unless it is for me to view more funerals? Who would have thought Priam could be happy when Pergama has fallen? Yet he is happy, in death! He did not see you killed, daughter, but left his kingdom and his life together
4217	metamorphoses	 Do I imagine you will be endowed with funereal splendour, and your body laid to rest in the ancestral tomb? That is not our house’s fate! Your mother’s tears will be your funeral gift, and the wastes of foreign sand
4218	metamorphoses	 I have lost everything: now an only child is left, once the youngest son of my family, his mother’s dearest, a reason to endure life for a brief space of time, Polydorus, sent to these shores, to the Ismarian king
4219	metamorphoses	" But why do I delay, meanwhile, the cleansing of your cruel wound with water, your face spattered with drops of blood?’
"
4220	metamorphoses	She spoke, and went to the shore, with the stumbling steps of an old woman, tearing at her white hair
4221	metamorphoses	 ‘Give me an urn, women of Troy!’ said the unhappy mother, wanting to draw water from the sea
4222	metamorphoses	 There, she saw Polydorus’s body, thrown on the beach, covered with open wounds made by Thracian spears
4223	metamorphoses	 The Trojan women cried out, but she was dumb with grief
4224	metamorphoses	 The grief itself obliterated both her powers of speech and the tears welling inside, and she stood unmoving like solid rock, at one moment with her gaze fixed on the ground, the next lifting her face grimly towards the sky
4225	metamorphoses	 Now she looked at her dead son’s face, now at his wounds, mostly at his wounds, awakening a growing anger in herself
4226	metamorphoses	 Then it blazed out, and she, as if she were still a queen, determined on vengeance, her whole mind filled with thoughts of punishment
4227	metamorphoses	Hecuba, her grief mixed with anger, forgetting her age, but not forgetting her rage, like a lioness maddened by the theft of her unweaned cub, that, though she cannot see her enemy, follows the traces she finds of his footsteps, found her way to the author of the dreadful crime, Polymestor
4228	metamorphoses	 She made out that she wanted to show him a secret hoard of gold, to be given to her son
4229	metamorphoses	 The Thracian believed her, and with his usual desire for gain, came with her secretly
4230	metamorphoses	 Then with smooth and cunning words, he said: ‘Do not delay, Hecuba: give me your gift to your son! It will all be for him, both what you give and what was given before, I swear by the gods
4231	metamorphoses	"’
"
4232	metamorphoses	She gazed at him, grimly, as he spoke and swore his lying oath, until, her seething anger boiling over, she called on her train of captive women to attack the man, and drove her nails into his deceitful eyes, and (made strong by anger) tore the eyeballs from their sockets, and dipped her hand, and drank, stained with his sinful blood, not from his eyes (nothing of them remained) but from the holes that were his eyes
4233	metamorphoses	The Thracians, enraged by the murder of their king, attacked the Trojan woman, hurling stones and missiles, but she chased the stones they threw, snapping at them with a harsh growling, and, readying her jaws for words, barked when she tried to speak
4234	metamorphoses	 The place is still there, and takes its name, Cynossema, the Monument of the Bitch, from this, and she still howls mournfully amongst the Sithonian fields, remembering endlessly her ancient suffering
4235	metamorphoses	Her fate moved the Trojans and her enemies the Greeks, and it moved all the gods as well, yes, all, so that even Juno, Jove’s sister-wife, said that Hecuba did not merit such misfortune
4236	metamorphoses	But Aurora had no time for being moved by the fall and ruin of Hecuba and Troy, though she had aided its defence
4237	metamorphoses	 A closer sorrow, and a private grief tormented her, the loss of her son Memnon, whom she, his bright mother, had seen wasted by Achilles’s spear on the Phrygian plain
4238	metamorphoses	 She saw it, and that colour, that reddens the dawn, paled, and the sky was covered with cloud
4239	metamorphoses	 His mother could not bear to look at his body laid on the summit of the funeral pyre, but with dishevelled hair, just as she was, she did not scorn to fall at the feet of mighty Jove, adding tears to these words: ‘I am the least of all, whom the golden heavens hold (since temples to me are the rarest in all the world), yet I come as a goddess: though not that you might give me sanctuaries, or sacred days, or altars to flame with sacrificial fires
4240	metamorphoses	 Yet if you considered what I, as a woman, do for you, when each new dawn I keep the borders of night, you would think to give me some reward
4241	metamorphoses	 But that is not my care, nor Aurora’s errand, to ask for well-merited honours
4242	metamorphoses	I come bereft of my Memnon, who bore arms bravely, but in vain, for his uncle Priam, and in his youth has fallen to mighty Achilles (so you willed)
4243	metamorphoses	 I beg you to grant him some honour, as a solace for his death, great king of the gods, and lessen a mother’s wound!’ Jupiter nodded, while Memnon’s steep pyre collapsed in leaping flames, and the daylight was stained with columns of black smoke, like the river-fog the naiad breathes out, that does not admit the light beneath it
4244	metamorphoses	 Dark ashes flew upwards, and gathering into a ball and solidifying, they formed a shape, and it drew life and heat from the fire (its own lightness giving it wings)
4245	metamorphoses	 At first resembling a bird, then a true bird, it clapped its wings, and innumerable sisters, sprung from the same natal source, sounded too
4246	metamorphoses	 Three times they circled the pyre, and three times their clamour rose in the air in consonance, on the fourth flight the flock divided
4247	metamorphoses	 Then in two separate fierce bands they made war, wielding beaks and hooked talons in rage, wearying wing and breast in the struggle
4248	metamorphoses	Remembering they were sprung from a brave hero, they fell as offerings to the buried ashes of their kinsman’s body
4249	metamorphoses	 The source of these suddenly created birds gave them his name: from him they were called the Memnonides: and when the sun has transited his twelve signs, they war and die again in ritual festival
4250	metamorphoses	And so, while others wept to witness Hecuba’s baying, Aurora was intent on her own grief, and even now she sheds tears, and wets the whole world with dew
4251	metamorphoses	Yet the fates did not allow Troy’s destiny, also, to be overthrown with her walls
4252	metamorphoses	 Aeneas, Cytherean Venus’s heroic son, carried away on his shoulders her sacred icons, and bore his father, another sacred and venerable burden
4253	metamorphoses	 He dutifully chose that prize from all his riches, and his son Ascanius, and carried over the sea in his exiled fleet, he left Antandros’s harbour, and the sinful thresholds of Thrace, and the soil drenched in Polydorus’s blood, and riding the favourable winds and tides, he came with his company of friends, to the city of Apollo on Delos
4254	metamorphoses	Anius, who ruled the people, and worshipped Phoebus, with the proper ritual, as high priest, received him in palace and temple
4255	metamorphoses	 He showed him the city, the famous sanctuary, and the two trees to which Latona clung when she gave birth
4256	metamorphoses	 They gave incense to the flames, poured wine onto the incense, and, in accord with custom, burned the entrails of slaughtered oxen, and then sought out the royal palace, where reclining on high couches, they ate the gifts of Ceres, and drank the wine of Bacchus
4257	metamorphoses	Then virtuous Anchises said: ‘O chosen priest of Phoebus, am I wrong, or do I not remember that you had a son and four daughters, when I first saw your city?’ Shaking his head, bound with its white sacrificial fillets, Anius replied sadly: ‘Mightiest of heroes, you are not wrong: you saw me the father of five children, whom now you see almost bereft
4258	metamorphoses	 What is the use of my absent son, who holds the island of Andros, that takes its name from him, and rules it in his father’s place? Delian Apollo gave him the power of prophecy
4259	metamorphoses	 Bacchus Liber gave my female offspring other gifts, greater than those they hoped or prayed for
4260	metamorphoses	 All that my daughter’s touched turned into corn or wine or the grey-green olives of Minerva, and employing them was profitable
4261	metamorphoses	When Agamemnon, son of Atreus, ravager of Troy, learned of this (so that you do not think we escaped all knowledge of your destructive storm) he used armed force to snatch my unwilling daughters from a father’s arms, and ordered them to feed the Greek fleet, using their gift from heaven
4262	metamorphoses	 Each escaped where they could
4263	metamorphoses	 Two made for Euboea, and two for their brother’s island of Andros
4264	metamorphoses	 The army landed and threatened war unless they were given up
4265	metamorphoses	 Fear overcame brotherly affection, and he surrendered his blood-kin
4266	metamorphoses	 It is possible to forgive the cowardly brother, since Aeneas and Hector, thanks to whom you held out till the tenth year, were not here to defend Andros
4267	metamorphoses	Now they were readying the chains for the prisoners’ arms
4268	metamorphoses	 They, while their arms were free, stretched them out to the sky, saying: “Bacchus, father, bring your aid!” and he, who granted their gifts, helped them – if you call it help for them to lose in some strange way their human form, for I could not discover by what process they lost it, nor can I describe it
4269	metamorphoses	 The end of this misfortune I did observe: they took wing, and became snow-white doves, the birds of your goddess-wife Anchises, Venus
4270	metamorphoses	"’
"
4271	metamorphoses	After they had filled the time with these and other matters, they left the table and retired to sleep, and rising with the dawn, they went to the oracle of Phoebus, who ordered them to seek their ancient mother, and their ancestral shores
4272	metamorphoses	The king gave them parting gifts and escorted them on their way: a sceptre for Anchises, a cloak and quiver for his grandson, Ascanius, and a drinking-bowl for Aeneas, that Therses of Thebes, a friend, had sent, from the Aonian coast, to the king: Therses had given it, but it was made by Alcon of Hyle, who had engraved it with a complete story
4273	metamorphoses	There was a city, and you could see its seven gates: these served to name it, and tell you that it was Thebes
4274	metamorphoses	 In front of the city funeral rites, sepulchres, funeral pyres, and fires, and women with naked breasts and streaming hair, depicted mourning
4275	metamorphoses	 Nymphs, also, appeared weeping, and lamenting their dried-up fountains: the trees stood bare and leafless: goats nibbled the dry gravel
4276	metamorphoses	See here, in the midst of Thebes he portrays Orion’s daughters, the one, more than a woman, slashing her unprotected throat, the other stabbing a weapon into her valiant breast, falling on behalf of their people, then carried in glorious funeral procession through the city, and burned among crowds of mourners
4277	metamorphoses	 Then two youths, famous as the Coroni, spring from the virgin ashes, so that the race will not die, and lead the cortège containing their mother’s remains
4278	metamorphoses	Such was the ancient bronze with its gleaming designs: round the rim gilded acanthus leaves were embossed
4279	metamorphoses	 The Trojans gave gifts in return, worth no less: an incense-box for the priest, a libation-saucer, and a crown shining with gold and jewels
4280	metamorphoses	From there, remembering that they, the Teucrians, came originally from the blood of Teucer, they made for his Crete
4281	metamorphoses	 But, unable to endure Jove’s plague, they left Crete with its hundred cities, hoping to reach the harbours of Ausonian Italy
4282	metamorphoses	 Tempests raged, and tossed the heroes on stormy seas, and taking refuge in the treacherous harbour of the Strophades, they were terrified by the harpy, Aëllo
4283	metamorphoses	Now they were carried past Dulichium’s anchorage; past Same, and the houses of Neritos; and Ithaca, cunning Ulysses’s kingdom
4284	metamorphoses	 They saw Ambracia, famous now for its Apollo of Actium, once contended over by quarreling gods; and saw the image of the judge who was turned to stone; Dodona’s land with its oracular oaks; and Chaonia’s bay, where the sons of Munichus, the Molossian king, escaped the impious flames on new-found wings
4285	metamorphoses	Next they headed for the country of the Phaeacians, set with rich orchards, and touched at Buthrotus in Epirus, a miniature Troy, ruled by Helenus, the Trojan seer
4286	metamorphoses	 From there, certain of their future, all of which Helenus, Priam’s son predicted, with reliable warnings, they entered Sicilian waters
4287	metamorphoses	 Three tongues of this land run down into the sea
4288	metamorphoses	 Of these Pachynos faces the rainy south, Lilybaeon fronts the soft western breeze, and Peloros looks to the northern Bears that never touch the waves
4289	metamorphoses	 Here the Teucrians came, and rowing, with a favourable tide, their fleet reached the sandy beach of Zancle, as night fell
4290	metamorphoses	Scylla attacks from the right-hand coast, restless Charybdis from the left
4291	metamorphoses	 The latter sucks down and spits out ships she has caught: the former has a girdle of savage dogs round her dark belly
4292	metamorphoses	 She has a girl’s face, and if the tales of poets are not all false, she was once a girl also
4293	metamorphoses	 Many suitors wooed her, whom she rejected, and she would go and tell the ocean nymphs, being well loved by the ocean nymphs, of the thwarted desires of young men
4294	metamorphoses	Once while Galatea let Scylla comb her hair, she addressed these words to her, sighing often: ‘At least, O virgin Scylla, you are not wooed by a relentless breed of men: and you can reject them without fear, as you do
4295	metamorphoses	 But I, whose father is Nereus, and whose mother is sea-green Doris, I, though protected by a crowd of sisters, was not allowed to flee the love of Polyphemus, the Cyclops, except through sorrow’, and tears stopped the sound of her voice
4296	metamorphoses	 When the girl had wiped away the tears with her white fingers, and the goddess was comforted, she said: ‘Tell me, O dearest one: do not hide the cause of your sadness (I can be so trusted)’ The Nereid answered Crateis’s daughter in these words: ‘Acis was the son of Faunus and the nymph Symaethis, a great delight to his father and mother, but more so even to me, since he and I alone were united
4297	metamorphoses	 He was handsome, and having marked his sixteenth birthday, a faint down covered his tender cheeks
4298	metamorphoses	 I sought him, the Cyclops sought me, endlessly
4299	metamorphoses	 If you asked, I could not say which was stronger in me, hatred of Cyclops or love of Acis, both of them were equally strong
4300	metamorphoses	Oh! Gentle Venus, how powerful your rule is over us! How that ruthless creature, terrifying even to the woods themselves, whom no stranger has ever seen with impunity, who scorns mighty Olympus and its gods, how he feels what love is, and, on fire, captured by powerful desire, forgets his flocks and caves
4301	metamorphoses	 Now Polyphemus, you care for your appearance, and are anxious to please, now you comb your bristling hair with a rake, and are pleased to cut your shaggy beard with a reaping hook, and to gaze at your savage face in the water and compose its expression
4302	metamorphoses	 Your love of killing, your fierceness, and your huge thirst for blood, end, and the ships come and go in safety
4303	metamorphoses	Meanwhile, Telemus the augur, Telemus, the son of Eurymus, whom no flight of birds could deceive, came to Sicilian Mount Aetna, addressed grim Polyphemus, and said: “Ulysses will take from you, that single eye in the middle of your forehead
4304	metamorphoses	” He laughed, and answered: “O most foolish of seers, you are wrong, another, a girl, has already taken it
4305	metamorphoses	” So he scorned the true warning, given in vain, and weighed the coast down, walking with giant tread, or returned weary to his dark cave
4306	metamorphoses	A wedge-shaped hillside, ending in a long spur, projects into the sea (the waves of the ocean wash round it on both sides)
4307	metamorphoses	 The fierce Cyclops climbed to it, and sat at its apex, and his woolly flocks, shepherd-less, followed
4308	metamorphoses	 Then laying at his feet the pine trunk he used as a staff, fit to carry a ship’s rigging, he lifted his panpipes made of a hundred reeds
4309	metamorphoses	 The whole mountain felt the pastoral notes, and the waves felt them too
4310	metamorphoses	" Hidden by a rock, I was lying in my Acis’s arms, and my ears caught these words, and, having heard them, I remembered:’
"
4311	metamorphoses	"‘Galatea, whiter than the snowy privet petals,
"
4312	metamorphoses	"taller than slim alder, more flowery than the meadows,
"
4313	metamorphoses	"friskier than a tender kid, more radiant than crystal,
"
4314	metamorphoses	"smoother than the shells, polished, by the endless tides;
"
4315	metamorphoses	"more welcome than the summer shade, or the sun in winter,
"
4316	metamorphoses	"showier than the tall plane-tree, fleeter than the hind; 
"
4317	metamorphoses	"more than ice sparkling, sweeter than grapes ripening,
"
4318	metamorphoses	"softer than the swan’s-down, or the milk when curdled,
"
4319	metamorphoses	lovelier, if you did not flee, than a watered garden
4320	metamorphoses	"Galatea, likewise, wilder than an untamed heifer,
"
4321	metamorphoses	"harder than an ancient oak, trickier than the sea;
"
4322	metamorphoses	"tougher than the willow-twigs, or the white vine branches,
"
4323	metamorphoses	"firmer than these cliffs, more turbulent than a river,
"
4324	metamorphoses	"vainer than the vaunted peacock, fiercer than the fire;
"
4325	metamorphoses	"more truculent than a pregnant bear, pricklier than thistles,
"
4326	metamorphoses	"deafer than the waters, crueller than a trodden snake;
"
4327	metamorphoses	"oh, what I wish I could alter in you, most of all, is this:
"
4328	metamorphoses	"that you are swifter than the deer, driven by loud barking,
"
4329	metamorphoses	swifter even than the winds, and the passing breeze
4330	metamorphoses	But if you knew me well, you would regret your flight, and you would condemn your own efforts yourself, and hold to me: half of the mountain is mine, and the deep caves in the natural rock, where winter is not felt nor the midsummer sun
4331	metamorphoses	 There are apples that weigh down the branches, golden and purple grapes on the trailing vines
4332	metamorphoses	 Those, and these, I keep for you
4333	metamorphoses	 You will pick ripe strawberries born in the woodland shadows, in autumn cherries and plums, not just the juicy blue-purples, but also the large yellow ones, the colour of fresh bees’-wax
4334	metamorphoses	 There will be no lack of fruit from the wild strawberry trees, nor from the tall chestnuts: every tree will be there to serve you
4335	metamorphoses	This whole flock is mine, and many are wandering the valleys as well, many hidden by the woods, many penned in the caves
4336	metamorphoses	 If you asked me I could not tell you how many there are: a poor man counts his flocks
4337	metamorphoses	 You can see, you need not merely believe me, how they can hardly move their legs with their full udders
4338	metamorphoses	 There are newborn lambs in the warn sheepfolds, and kids too, of the same age, in other pens, and I always have snow-white milk: some of it kept for drinking, and some with rennet added to curdle it
4339	metamorphoses	You will not have vulgar gifts or easily found pleasures, such as leverets, or does, or kids, or paired doves, or a nest from the treetops
4340	metamorphoses	 I came upon twin cubs of a shaggy bear that you can play with: so alike you can hardly separate them
4341	metamorphoses	 I came upon them and I said: “I shall keep these for my mistress
4342	metamorphoses	"”
"
4343	metamorphoses	Now Galatea, only lift your shining head from the dark blue sea: come, do not scorn my gifts
4344	metamorphoses	 Lately, I examined myself, it’s true, and looked at my reflection in the clear water, and, seeing my self, it pleased me
4345	metamorphoses	 Look how large I am: Jupiter, in the sky, since you are accustomed to saying some Jove or other rules there, has no bigger a body
4346	metamorphoses	 Luxuriant hair hangs over my face, and shades my shoulders like a grove
4347	metamorphoses	 And do not consider it ugly for my whole body to be bristling with thick prickly hair
4348	metamorphoses	 A tree is ugly without its leaves: a horse is ugly unless a golden mane covers its neck: feathers hide the birds: their wool becomes the sheep: a beard and shaggy hair befits a man’s body
4349	metamorphoses	 I only have one eye in the middle of my forehead, but it is as big as a large shield
4350	metamorphoses	 Well? Does great Sol not see all this from the sky? Yet Sol’s orb is unique
4351	metamorphoses	Added to that my father, Neptune, rules over your waters: I give you him as a father-in-law
4352	metamorphoses	 Only have pity, and listen to my humble prayers! I, who scorn Jove and his heaven and his piercing lightning bolt, submit to you alone: I fear you, Nereid: your anger is fiercer than lightning
4353	metamorphoses	 And I could bear this contempt of yours more patiently, if you fled from everyone
4354	metamorphoses	 But why, rejecting Cyclops, love Acis, and prefer Acis’s embrace to mine? Though he is pleased with himself, and, what I dislike, pleases you too, Galatea, let me just have a chance at him
4355	metamorphoses	 Then he will know I am as strong as I am big! I’ll tear out his entrails while he lives, rend his limbs and scatter them over the fields, and over your ocean, (so he can join you!) For I am on fire, and, wounded, I burn with a fiercer flame, and I seem to bear Aetna with all his violent powers sunk in my breast, yet you, Galatea, are unmoved
4356	metamorphoses	"’
"
4357	metamorphoses	‘With such useless complaints he rose (for I saw it all) and as a bull that cannot stay still, furious when the cow is taken from it, he wanders through the woods and glades
4358	metamorphoses	 Not anticipating such a thing, without my knowing, he saw me, and saw Acis
4359	metamorphoses	 “I see you,” he cried, “and I’ll make this the last celebration of your love
4360	metamorphoses	” His voice was as loud as an angry Cyclops’s voice must be: Aetna shook with the noise
4361	metamorphoses	 And I, terrified, plunged into the nearby waters
4362	metamorphoses	" My hero, son of Symaethis, had turned his back, and ran, crying: “Help me, I beg you, Galatea! Forefathers, help me, admit me to your kingdom or I die!”
"
4363	metamorphoses	Cyclops followed him and hurled a rock wrenched from the mountain, and though only the farthest corner of the stone reached him, it still completely buried Acis
4364	metamorphoses	 Then I, doing the only thing that fate allowed me, caused Acis to assume his ancestral powers
4365	metamorphoses	 From the rock, crimson blood seeped out, and in a little while its redness began to fade, became the colour of a river at first swollen by rain, gradually clearing
4366	metamorphoses	 Then the rock, that Polyphemus had hurled, cracked open, and a tall green reed sprang from the fissure, and the mouth of a chamber in the rock echoed with leaping waters, and (a marvel) suddenly a youth stood, waist-deep in the water, his fresh horns wreathed with rushes
4367	metamorphoses	 It was Acis, except that he was larger, and his face dark blue: yet it was still Acis, changed to a river-god, and his waters still retain his former name
4368	metamorphoses	Galatea finished speaking and the group of Nereids went away, swimming through the placid waves
4369	metamorphoses	 Scylla returned to the beach, not daring to trust herself to mid-ocean, and either wandered naked along the parched sand, or, when she was tired, found a remote, sheltered pool, and cooled her limbs in its enclosed waters
4370	metamorphoses	See, Glaucus comes, skimming the water, a new inhabitant of the sea, his form recently altered, at Anthedon opposite Euboea
4371	metamorphoses	 Seeing the girl, he stood still, desiring her, and said whatever he thought might stop her running away
4372	metamorphoses	 Nevertheless she ran, and, with the swiftness of fear, came to the top of a mountain standing near the shore
4373	metamorphoses	 It faced the wide sea, rising to a single peak, its wooded summit leaning far out over the water
4374	metamorphoses	 Here she stopped, and from a place of safety, marvelled at his colour; the hair that hid his shoulders and covered his back; and his groin below that merged into a winding fish’s tail; she not knowing whether he was god or monster
4375	metamorphoses	He saw her, and, leaning on a rock that stood nearby, he said: ‘Girl, I am no freak or wild creature, but a god of the sea
4376	metamorphoses	 Proteus, Triton, or Palaemon son of Athamas, have no greater power in the ocean
4377	metamorphoses	 Mortal once, but no doubt destined for the deep, even then I worked the waves: now drawing in the drag nets full of fish, now sitting on a rock, casting, with rod and line
4378	metamorphoses	There is a beach, bounded by a green field, one side bordered by sea, the other by grass, that horned cattle have not damaged by grazing, that placid sheep or shaggy goats have not cropped
4379	metamorphoses	 No bees intent on gathering pollen plundered the flowers there; no garlands came from there for the heads of revellers; no one had ever mown it, scythe in hand
4380	metamorphoses	 I was the first to sit there on the turf, drying my sea-soaked lines, and laying out in order the fish I had caught, to count them, that either chance or innocence had brought to my curved hook
4381	metamorphoses	 This will sound like a tale, but what would I get from lying? Touching the grass, my catch began to stir, and shift about, and swim over land as if they were in the sea
4382	metamorphoses	 While I hesitated and wondered, the complete shoal fled into their native waters, leaving behind their new master, their new land
4383	metamorphoses	I stood dumbfounded, for a while not believing it, searching for the cause
4384	metamorphoses	 Had some god done it, or the juice of some herb? “Yet what herb has such power?” I asked, and gathering some herbage in my hand, I bit what I had gathered with my teeth
4385	metamorphoses	 My throat had scarcely swallowed the strange juice, when suddenly I felt my heart trembling inside me, my breast seized with yearning for that other element
4386	metamorphoses	 Unable to hold out for long, crying out: “Land, I will never return to, goodbye!” I immersed my body in the sea
4387	metamorphoses	The gods of the sea received me, thinking me worth the honour of their company, and asked Oceanus and Tethys to purge what was mortal in me
4388	metamorphoses	 I was purified by them, and, cleansed of sin by an incantation nine times repeated, they ordered me to bathe my body in a hundred rivers
4389	metamorphoses	 Immediately streams from every side poured their waters over my head
4390	metamorphoses	 So much I can tell of you of those marvellous things, so much of them I remember: then my mind knew no more
4391	metamorphoses	 When later I came to, my whole body was altered from what I was before, and my mind was not the same
4392	metamorphoses	Then I saw, for the first time, this dark green beard, my hair that sweeps the wide sea, these giant shoulders and dusky arms, these legs that curve below into a fish’s fins
4393	metamorphoses	" Yet what use is this shape, or that I was pleasing to the ocean gods? What use is it to be a god, if these things do not move you?’
"
4394	metamorphoses	As the god spoke these words, looking to say more, Scylla abandoned him
4395	metamorphoses	 Then Glaucus, maddened, and angered by her rejection, sought the wondrous halls of Circe, daughter of the Sun
4396	metamorphoses	Glaucus, the fisher of the swollen Euboean waters, soon left Aetna behind, that mountain piled on Typhoeus’s giant head, and the Cyclops’s fields, that know nothing of the plough’s use or the harrow, and owe nothing to the yoked oxen
4397	metamorphoses	 Zancle was left behind as well, and the walls of Rhegium opposite, and the dangerous strait, hemmed in between twin coastlines, that marks the boundary between Sicily and Italian Ausonia
4398	metamorphoses	 From there, swimming with mighty strokes, across the Tyrrhenian Sea, he came to the grassy hills and the halls of Circe, daughter of the Sun, filled with transformed beasts
4399	metamorphoses	As soon as he saw her, and words of welcome had been exchanged, he said: ‘Goddess, I beg you, take pity on a god! You alone can help this love of mine, if I seem worthy of help
4400	metamorphoses	 No one knows better than I, Titaness, what power herbs have, since I was transmuted by them
4401	metamorphoses	 So that the cause of my passion is not unknown to you, I saw Scylla, on the Italian coast, opposite Messene’s walls
4402	metamorphoses	 I am ashamed to tell of the prayers and promises, the blandishments I used, words that were scorned
4403	metamorphoses	 If there is any power in charms, utter a charm from your sacred lips: or, if herbs are more potent, use the proven strength of active herbs
4404	metamorphoses	 I trust you not to cure me, or heal me, of these wounds: my love cannot end: only let her feel this heat
4405	metamorphoses	No one has a nature more susceptible to such fires than Circe, whether the root of it is in herself, or whether Venus, offended by Sol her father’s tale-bearing, made her that way, so she replied: ‘You would do better to chase after someone whose wishes and purposes were yours, and who was captured by equal desire
4406	metamorphoses	 Besides, you were worth courting (and certainly could be courted), and if you offer any hope, believe me you will be too
4407	metamorphoses	 If you doubt it, and have no faith in your attractions, well, I, though I am a goddess, daughter of shining Sol, though I possess such powers of herbs and charms, I promise to be yours
4408	metamorphoses	 Spurn the spurner, repay the admirer, and, in one act, be twice revenged
4409	metamorphoses	"’
"
4410	metamorphoses	To such temptations as these Glaucus replied: ‘Sooner than my love will change, Scylla unchanged, leaves will grow on the waters, and sea-weed will grow on the hills
4411	metamorphoses	’ The goddess was angered, and since she could not harm him (nor, loving him, wished to do so) she was furious with the girl, who was preferred to her
4412	metamorphoses	 Offended at his rejection of her passion, she at once ground noxious herbs with foul juices, and joined the spells of Hecate to their grinding
4413	metamorphoses	 Wrapping herself in a dusky cloak, she made her way from the palace, through the crowd of fawning beasts, and sought out Rhegium opposite Zancle’s cliffs, travelling over the seething tidal waters, as if she trod on solid ground, crossing dry-footed over the surface of the sea
4414	metamorphoses	There was a little pool, curved in a smooth arc, dear to Scylla for its peacefulness
4415	metamorphoses	 When the sun was strongest, at the zenith, and from its heights made shortest shadows, she retreated there from the heat of sky and sea
4416	metamorphoses	 This, the goddess tainted in advance and contaminated with her monstrous poison
4417	metamorphoses	 She sprinkled the liquid squeezed from harmful roots, and muttered a mysterious incantation, dark with strange words, thrice nine times, in magical utterance
4418	metamorphoses	Scylla comes, wading waist deep into the pool, only to find the water around her groin erupt with yelping monsters
4419	metamorphoses	 At first, not thinking them part of her own body, she retreats from their cruel muzzles, fears them, and pushes them away: but, what she flees from, she pulls along with her, and, seeking her thighs, her legs, her feet, in place of them finds jaws like Cerberus’s
4420	metamorphoses	 She stands among raging dogs, and is encircled by beasts, below the surface, from which her truncated thighs and belly emerge
4421	metamorphoses	Her lover Glaucus wept, and fled Circe’s embrace, she, who had made too hostile a use of her herbs’ powers
4422	metamorphoses	 Scylla remained where she was, and, at the first opportunity, in her hatred of Circe, robbed Ulysses of his companions
4423	metamorphoses	 Later she would have overwhelmed the Trojan ships, if she had not previously been transformed into a rock, whose stone is visible even now: a rock that sailors still avoid
4424	metamorphoses	When the oarsmen of the Trojan ships had escaped Scylla, and rapacious Charybdis, when they had almost reached the Ausonian shore, the wind carried them to the coast of Libya
4425	metamorphoses	 There Sidonian Queen Dido took Aeneas into her heart and home, she, who was fated not to endure her Phrygian husband’s departure
4426	metamorphoses	 She stabbed herself with his sword, on a blazing pyre, that was built as if it were intended for sacred rites, deceiving, as she had been deceived
4427	metamorphoses	Fleeing from the new city, Carthage, and its sandy shores, and carried back to the home of his loyal half-brother Acestes, son of Venus of Eryx, Aeneas sacrificed there, and paid honours at his dead father’s, Anchises’s, tomb
4428	metamorphoses	 Then he loosed the ships, that Iris almost destroyed by fire, at Juno’s command, and passed the Aeolian Islands, smoking with clouds of hot sulphur, the kingdom of Aeolus, son of Hippotes, and passed the rocky isle of the Sirens, the daughters of Acheloüs
4429	metamorphoses	Bereft of its pilot, Palinurus, he follows the coast by Inarime, Prochyte, and Pithecusae, on its barren hill, named after its inhabitants, from pithecium, a little ape
4430	metamorphoses	 For the father of the gods, Jupiter, hating the lying and deceit of the Cercopes, and the crimes of that treacherous people, changed them into disgraceful creatures, so that, though unlike men, they should seem like them
4431	metamorphoses	 He contracted their limbs, turned up and blunted their noses, and furrowed their faces with the wrinkles of old age
4432	metamorphoses	 Their bodies completely covered by yellow hair, he sent them, as monkeys, to this place, but not before he had robbed them of the power of speech, and those tongues born for dreadful deceit, leaving them only the power to complain in raucous shrieks
4433	metamorphoses	When he had passed those islands, and left the walls of Parthenope behind him to starboard, the tomb of Misenus, the trumpeter, the son of Aeolus, was to larboard, and the shore of Cumae, a place filled with marshy sedges
4434	metamorphoses	 He entered the cave of the Sibyl, and asked to go down to Avernus, to find his father’s ghost
4435	metamorphoses	 Then the Sibyl after remaining, for a long time, with her eyes gazing at the earth, lifted them, at last, filled with the frenzy of the god, and cried: ‘You ask great things, man of great achievements, whose hand has been tested by the sword, whose faith has been tested by the fire
4436	metamorphoses	 But have no fear, Trojan, you will have what you desire, and, with me as your guide, you will know the halls of Elysium, and earth’s strangest realm, and the likeness of your dear father
4437	metamorphoses	 To virtue, no way is barred
4438	metamorphoses	"’
"
4439	metamorphoses	She spoke, and pointed out to him a gleaming golden bough, in the woods of Proserpine, the Juno of Avernus, and ordered him to break it from the tree
4440	metamorphoses	 Aeneas obeyed, and saw the power of dread Dis, and he saw his own ancestors, and the ancient shade of great-souled Anchises
4441	metamorphoses	 He learned also the laws of those regions, and the trials he must undergo in fresh wars
4442	metamorphoses	Then taking the return path, with weary paces, he eased the labour by talking with his Cumean guide
4443	metamorphoses	 As he travelled the fearful road through the shadowy twilight, he said: ‘Whether you are truly a goddess, or only most beloved by the gods, you will always be like a goddess to me, and I will acknowledge myself in your debt, who have allowed me to enter the place of the dead, and having seen that place of the dead, escape it
4444	metamorphoses	 When I reach the upper air, I will build a temple to you, for this service, and burn incense in your honour
4445	metamorphoses	"’
"
4446	metamorphoses	The priestess gazed at him and with a deep sigh, said: ‘I am not a goddess: do not assume any human being is worth the honour of holy incense, or err out of ignorance
4447	metamorphoses	 I was offered eternal life without end, if I would surrender my virginity to Phoebus my lover
4448	metamorphoses	 While he still hoped for it, while he desired to bribe me beforehand with gifts, he said: “Virgin of Cumae, choose what you wish, and what you wish you shall have
4449	metamorphoses	” Pointing to a pile of dust, that had collected, I foolishly begged to have as many anniversaries of my birth, as were represented by the dust
4450	metamorphoses	 But I forgot to ask that the years should be accompanied by youth
4451	metamorphoses	 He gave me the years, and lasting youth, as well, if I would surrender: I rejected Phoebus’s gift, and never married
4452	metamorphoses	But now my more fruitful time has turned its back on me, and old age comes, with tottering step, that must be long endured
4453	metamorphoses	 Though I have now lived seven centuries, three hundred harvests, three hundred vintages, still remain to be seen, to equal the content of the dust
4454	metamorphoses	 The time will come when the passage of days will render such body as I have tiny, and my limbs, consumed with age, will reduce to the slightest of burdens
4455	metamorphoses	 I will be thought never to have loved, and never to have delighted a god
4456	metamorphoses	 Phoebus too perhaps will either not know me, or will deny that he loved me
4457	metamorphoses	 I will go as far as having to suffer transformation, and I will be viewed as non-existent, but still known as a voice: the fates will bequeath me a voice
4458	metamorphoses	"’
"
4459	metamorphoses	As the Sibyl spoke these words, they emerged, by the rising path, from the Stygian regions, into the city of Cumae of the Euboeans
4460	metamorphoses	 Trojan Aeneas came to the shore that was later named after his nurse Caieta, where he carried out her funeral rites, as accepted, according to custom
4461	metamorphoses	 This was also the place where Macareus of Neritos, a companion of sorely tried Ulysses, had settled, after the interminable weariness of hardship
4462	metamorphoses	Macareus now recognised Achaemenides, among the Trojans, he, who had been given up as lost, by Ulysses, long ago, among the rocks of Aetna
4463	metamorphoses	 Astonished to discover him, unexpectedly, still alive, he asked: ‘What god or chance preserved you, Achaemenides? Why does a Trojan vessel now carry a Greek? What land is your ship bound for? Achaemenides, no longer clothed in rags, his shreds of clothing held together with thorns, but himself again, replied to his questions, in these words: ‘If this ship is not more to me than Ithaca and my home, if I revere Aeneas less than my father, let me gaze at Polyphemus once more, with his gaping mouth dripping human blood
4464	metamorphoses	 I can never thank Aeneas enough, even if I offered my all
4465	metamorphoses	 Could I forget, or be ungrateful for, the fact that I speak and breathe and see the sky and the sun’s glory? Aeneas granted that my life did not end in the monster’s jaws, and when I leave the light of day, now, I shall be buried in the tomb, not, indeed, in its belly
4466	metamorphoses	What were my feelings, then (if fear had not robbed me of all sense and feeling), abandoned, seeing you making for the open sea? I wanted to shout to you, but feared to reveal myself to the enemy
4467	metamorphoses	 Indeed, Ulysses’s shout nearly wrecked your vessel
4468	metamorphoses	 I watched as Cyclops tore an enormous boulder from the mountainside, and threw it into the midst of the waves
4469	metamorphoses	 I watched again as he hurled huge stones, as if from a catapult, using the power of his gigantic arms, and, forgetting I was not on board the ship, I was terrified that the waves and air they displaced would sink her
4470	metamorphoses	When you escaped by flight from certain death, Polyphemus roamed over the whole of Aetna, groaning, and groping through the woods with his hands, stumbling, bereft of his sight, among the rocks
4471	metamorphoses	" Stretching out his arms, spattered with blood, to the sea, he cursed the Greek race like the plague, saying: “O, if only chance would return Ulysses to me, or one of his companions, on whom I could vent my wrath, whose entrails I could eat, whose living body I could tear with my hands, whose blood could fill my gullet, and whose torn limbs could quiver between my teeth: the damage to me of my lost sight would count little or nothing then!”
"
4472	metamorphoses	Fiercely he shouted, this and more
4473	metamorphoses	 I was pale with fear, looking at his face still dripping with gore, his cruel hands, the empty eye-socket, his limbs and beard coated with human blood
4474	metamorphoses	 Death was in front of my eyes, but that was still the least of evils
4475	metamorphoses	 Now he’ll catch me, I thought, now he’ll merge my innards with his own, and the image stuck in my mind of the moment when I saw him hurl two of my friends against the ground, three, four times, and crouching over them like a shaggy lion, he filled his greedy jaws with flesh and entrails, bones full of white marrow, and warm limbs
4476	metamorphoses	Trembling seized me: I stood there, pale and downcast, watching him chew and spit out his bloody feast, vomiting up lumps of matter, mixed with wine
4477	metamorphoses	 I imagined a like fate was being prepared for my wretched self
4478	metamorphoses	 I hid for many days, trembling at every sound, scared of dying but longing to be dead, staving off hunger with acorns, and a mixture of leaves and grasses, alone, without help or hope, left to torture and death
4479	metamorphoses	After a long stretch of time, I spied this ship far off, begging them by gestures to rescue me, and ran to the shore and moved their pity: a Trojan ship received a Greek! Now, dearest of comrades, tell me of your fortunes too, and of your leader, and the company that has entrusted itself to the sea with you
4480	metamorphoses	"’
"
4481	metamorphoses	Macareus spoke of how Aeolus ruled the Tuscan deep, Aeolus son of Hippotes, imprisoning the winds
4482	metamorphoses	 Ulysses, the Dulichian leader, had received them from him, an amazing gift, fastened up, in a bull’s hide bag
4483	metamorphoses	 Sailing for nine days, with a favourable wind, Ulysses and his crew spied the homelands they sought, but when the tenth morning came, his comrades were conquered by greed and desire for their share: thinking the bag contained gold, they loosened the strings that tied up the winds
4484	metamorphoses	 The ship was blown back over the waters, through which they had come, and, once more, entered King Aeolus’s harbour
4485	metamorphoses	‘From there,’ Macareus said, ‘we came to the ancient city of Lamus, of the Laestrygonians: Antiphates was now king in that land
4486	metamorphoses	 I was sent to him with two companions
4487	metamorphoses	 One of my friends and myself, fleeing, barely reached safety
4488	metamorphoses	 The third reddened the Laestrygonians’ evil mouths with his blood
4489	metamorphoses	 Antiphates chased us as we ran for it, urging his men on
4490	metamorphoses	 They rushed us, hurling rocks and tree-trunks, drowning the men, and sinking the ships
4491	metamorphoses	 The one which Ulysses himself, and I sailed in, escaped
4492	metamorphoses	Mourning our lost companions, lamenting greatly, we came to that land you see, in the distance, (believe me the island I saw is best seen from a distance!) and I warn you, O most virtuous of Trojans, son of the goddess, (since the war is over now, I will not treat you as an enemy, Aeneas) shun the shores of Circe! We, likewise, beaching our vessel, refused to go on, remembering Antiphates, and savage Cyclops: but we were chosen by lot to explore the unknown place
4493	metamorphoses	 I, and the loyal Polites, and also Eurylochus, and Elpenor, too fond of wine, and eighteen others of my comrades, were sent within Circe’s walls
4494	metamorphoses	We had no sooner arrived, and were standing on the threshold of her courts, when a thousand wolves, and mixed with the wolves, she-bears and lionesses rushed at us, filling us with terror
4495	metamorphoses	 But there was nothing to be afraid of: none of them gave our bodies a single scratch
4496	metamorphoses	 Why they even wagged their tails in the air with affection, and fawned on us, as they followed our footsteps, until female servants received us, and led us, through halls covered with marble, to their mistress
4497	metamorphoses	She sat in a lovely inner room on her sacred throne, wearing a shining robe, covered over with a gold-embroidered veil
4498	metamorphoses	 Nereids and nymphs were with her, who do not work wool with nimble fingers, nor, then, spin the thread: they arrange herbs, scattered without order, separating flowers and grasses of various colours, into baskets
4499	metamorphoses	 She herself directs the work they do: she herself knows the use of each leaf, which kinds mix in harmony, examines them, and pays attention to the weighing of the herbs
4500	metamorphoses	When she saw us, and words of welcome had been received, she smiled at us, and seemed to give a blessing to our desires
4501	metamorphoses	 Without delay she ordered a drink to be blended, of malted barley, honey, strong wine, and curdled milk, to which she secretly added juices, that its sweetness would hide
4502	metamorphoses	 We took the cup offered by her sacred hand
4503	metamorphoses	 As soon as we had drained it, thirstily, with parched lips, the dread goddess touched the top of our hair with her wand, and then (I am ashamed, but I will tell you) I began to bristle with hair, unable to speak now, giving out hoarse grunts instead of words, and to fall forward, completely facing the ground
4504	metamorphoses	I felt my mouth stiffening into a long snout, my neck swelling with brawn, and I made tracks on the ground, with the parts that had just now lifted the cup to my mouth
4505	metamorphoses	 I was shut in a sty with the others in the same state (so much can magic drugs achieve!) We saw that only Eurylochus had escaped the transformation: the only one to avoid the proffered cup
4506	metamorphoses	 If he had not refused, I would even now be one of the bristly herd, since Ulysses would not have heard of our plight from him, or come to Circe, as our avenger
4507	metamorphoses	Peace-loving Cyllenian Mercury had given him the white flower, the gods call moly, that springs from a black root
4508	metamorphoses	 With this, and divine warnings, he entered Circe’s house in safety, and, when he was asked to drink from the fateful cup, he struck aside the wand, with which she tried to stroke his hair, and scared off the frightened goddess, with drawn sword
4509	metamorphoses	 Then they gave their right hands to each other, as a pledge of good faith, and after being received into her bed as her husband, he asked for his friends’ true bodies to be restored, as a wedding gift
4510	metamorphoses	We were sprinkled with the more virtuous juices of unknown herbs, our heads were stroked with the wand reversed, and the words, she had said, were pronounced, with the words said backwards
4511	metamorphoses	 The more words she spoke, the more we stood erect, lifted from the ground
4512	metamorphoses	 Our bristles fell away, our cloven hoofs lost their cleft, our shoulders reappeared, and below them were our upper and lower arms
4513	metamorphoses	 Weeping we embraced him, as he wept himself, and clung to our leader’s neck, and nothing was said until we had testified to our gratitude
4514	metamorphoses	We stayed there for a year, and, in that length of time, I saw and heard many things
4515	metamorphoses	 Here is one told me, in secret, by one of the four female servants, dedicated to those earlier tasks
4516	metamorphoses	 While Circe was tarrying alone with our leader, the girl showed me the statue of a young man, carved out of snow-white marble, with a woodpecker’s head on top
4517	metamorphoses	 It stood in a holy temple, distinguished by many wreaths
4518	metamorphoses	 I asked, as I wished to know, who it was, and why he was worshipped in a holy temple, and why he bore a bird’s head
4519	metamorphoses	" She said “Listen, Macareus, and learn, as well, how great is my mistress’s power: keep your mind on my words!” ’
"
4520	metamorphoses	‘ “Picus, the son of Saturn, was king in the land of Ausonia, and loved horses trained for war
4521	metamorphoses	 The hero’s appearance was as you see it there
4522	metamorphoses	 Though, if you looked at his beauty itself, you would approve the true and not the imaginary form
4523	metamorphoses	 His spirit equalled his looks
4524	metamorphoses	 In age, he had not yet seen four of the five-yearly Games at Elis in Greece
4525	metamorphoses	 He had turned the heads of the dryads born on the hills of Latium: the nymphs of the fountains pursued him, and the naiads; those that live in the Tiber; and in the River Numicius; in Anio’s streams; and the brief course of the Almo; the rushing Nar; and Farfar of dense shadows; and those who haunt the wooded pool of Scythian Diana, and its neighbouring lakes
4526	metamorphoses	But, spurning them all, he loved one nymph alone, whom, it is said, Venilia once bore, on the Palatine hill, to two-faced Janus
4527	metamorphoses	 She, when she had grown to marriageable age, was given to Picus of Laurentum, preferred of all her suitors
4528	metamorphoses	 She was of rare beauty, but rarer her gift of song, so that she was called Canens
4529	metamorphoses	 She could move the rocks and trees with her singing, make wild beasts gentle, halt wide rivers, and detain the wandering birds
4530	metamorphoses	 One day when she was singing her song, with a girl’s expressiveness, Picus left home to hunt the native wild boar, in the Laurentian fields
4531	metamorphoses	 Astride the back of an eager mount, he carried two hunting spears in his left hand, and wore a Greek military cloak, dyed crimson, fastened with a golden brooch
4532	metamorphoses	Sol’s daughter had come to those same woods, leaving the fields, called Circean from her name, to cull fresh herbs in the fertile hills
4533	metamorphoses	 As soon as she saw the youth from the cover of a thicket, she was stunned: the herbs she had culled fell from her hand, and flames seemed to reach to her very marrow
4534	metamorphoses	 As soon as she had recovered rational thought after the wave of passion, she wanted to own to her desires, but she could not reach him, because of his horse’s speed, and his crowd of companions
4535	metamorphoses	 ‘Though the wind take you, you will not escape,’ she cried, ‘if I know my skill, if the power of herbs has not completely vanished, and my incantations do not fail
4536	metamorphoses	’ Saying this, she conjured up a bodiless phantom boar, and commanded it to cross under the king’s very eyes, and seem to enter a dense grove of trees, where the woods were thickest, and the place was impenetrable to horses
4537	metamorphoses	 Instantly, and unwittingly, without a moment’s delay, Picus, followed his shadowy prey, and, quickly leaping from the back of his foaming mount, he roamed, on foot, through the deep wood, chasing an empty promise
4538	metamorphoses	Circe recited curses, and spoke magic words, worshipping unknown gods, with unknown incantations, by which she used to dim the face of the bright moon, and veil her father’s orb, with moisture-loving cloud
4539	metamorphoses	Now, also, by her song, the sky is darkened, and the earth breathes out fog, and his companions wander on blind trails, and the king’s protection is lost
4540	metamorphoses	 Having made the time and place, she says: ‘O, by those eyes, that have captured mine, and by that beauty, most handsome of youths, that has made a goddess suppliant to you, think of my passion, and accept the sun, who sees all things, as your father-in-law
4541	metamorphoses	 Do not, unfeelingly, despise Circe, daughter of Titan
4542	metamorphoses	"’
"
4543	metamorphoses	She spoke: he fiercely rejected her and her entreaties, and said: ‘Whoever you may be, I am not for you
4544	metamorphoses	 Another has captured my love and holds me, and I hope she will hold me forever
4545	metamorphoses	 While the fates guard Canens, Janus’s daughter, for me, I will not harm our bond of affection by an alien love
4546	metamorphoses	" Repeating her entreaties, time and again, in vain, Circe cried: ‘You will not go unpunished, or return to your Canens, and you will learn the truth of what the wounded; a lover; a woman, can do: and Circe is a lover; is wounded; is a woman!’
"
4547	metamorphoses	Then twice to the west, twice to the east, she turned; thrice touched the youth with her wand, thrice spoke an incantation
4548	metamorphoses	 He ran, but was surprised to find himself running faster than before: he saw wings appear on his body
4549	metamorphoses	 Angered at his sudden transformation to a strange bird in the woods of Latium, he pecked at the rough oak wood with his hard beak, and in fury wounded the long branches
4550	metamorphoses	 The feathers of his crown and nape took on the colour of his crimson cloak, and what had been a golden brooch, pinning his clothes, became plumage, and his neck was surrounded behind by green-gold
4551	metamorphoses	 Nothing was left to Picus of his former being, except his name
4552	metamorphoses	"” ’
"
4553	metamorphoses	‘ “Meanwhile, his companions came upon Circe, after calling for Picus through the fields, often, and uselessly (she had now thinned the mist, and dispersed the clouds with winds, and revealed the sun)
4554	metamorphoses	 They pressed true charges against her; demanded the king; showed force; and prepared to attack her with deadly spears
4555	metamorphoses	 She sprinkled them with harmful drugs and poisonous juices, summoning Night and the gods of Night, from Erebus and Chaos, and calling on Hecate with long wailing cries
4556	metamorphoses	Marvellous to say, the trees tore from their roots, the earth rumbled, the surrounding woods turned white, and the grass she sprinkled was wet with drops of blood
4557	metamorphoses	 And the stones seemed to emit harsh groans, and dogs to bark, and the ground to crawl with black snakes, and the ghostly shades of the dead to hover
4558	metamorphoses	 The terrified band shuddered at these monstrosities
4559	metamorphoses	 She touched the fearful, stunned, faces with her wand, and, at its contact, the monstrous forms of various wild beasts appeared, as the warriors were transformed: none of them retained his human form
4560	metamorphoses	Now Phoebus, setting, dyed the shores of Spain, and Canens was looking, in vain, for her husband, with her eyes and in her thoughts
4561	metamorphoses	 Her servants, and her people, ran through the woods to meet him, carrying torches
4562	metamorphoses	 The nymph was not satisfied with weeping, and tearing at her hair, and beating her breast (though she did all those things) and she rushed out herself, and roamed madly through the fields of Latium
4563	metamorphoses	 Six nights, and as many returns of the sun’s light, found her wandering, without food or sleep, through valleys and hills, wherever chance lead her
4564	metamorphoses	Tiber was last to see her, as she lay down, weary with grief and journeying, on his wide banks
4565	metamorphoses	 There, she poured out her words of grief, tearfully, in faint tones, in harmony with sadness, just as the swan sings once, in dying, its own funeral song
4566	metamorphoses	 At the last she melted away, wasted by grief, liquefied to the marrow, little by little vanishing into thin air
4567	metamorphoses	 But her story is signified by the place, that the Muses of old, fittingly, called Canens, from the nymph’s name
4568	metamorphoses	"” ’
"
4569	metamorphoses	‘I heard many such stories, and saw many things throughout that long year
4570	metamorphoses	 Sluggish and torpid, through inactivity, we were commanded to spread the sails and travel the seas again
4571	metamorphoses	 Circe, the Titan’s daughter, had told us of the fierce dangers of the seas to come, the dangerous channels, and the vast reaches: I confess I was afraid, and finding this shore, I clung to it
4572	metamorphoses	’ Macareus had done
4573	metamorphoses	"Aeneas’s nurse, Caieta, was interred in a marble urn, having a brief epitaph carved on her tomb:
"
4574	metamorphoses	"HERE HE WHOM I, CAIETA, NURSED, WHO, NOTED FOR HIS PIETY,
"
4575	metamorphoses	SAVED ME FROM ACHAEAN FIRE, AS IS RIGHT, CREMATED ME
4576	metamorphoses	Freeing their cables from the grassy shore, and keeping far away from the treacherous island and the home of the infamous goddess, the Trojans sought the groves where dark-shadowed Tiber, rushes, yellow with sand, to the sea
4577	metamorphoses	 There, Aeneas won the daughter, Lavinia, and the kingdom of Latinus, son of Faunus, but not without a battle
4578	metamorphoses	Turnus fights with fury for his promised bride, and war is waged with a fierce people
4579	metamorphoses	 All Etruria clashes with Latium, and for a long time, with anxious struggle, hard-fought victory is looked for
4580	metamorphoses	 Both sides add to their strength with outside aid, and many support the Rutuli, many others the Trojan camp
4581	metamorphoses	Aeneas did not seek help from Evander in vain, but Venulus, sent by Turnus, had no profit from the city of exiled Diomede
4582	metamorphoses	 He had founded a major city, Arpi, in Daunus’s kingdom of Iapygia, and held the country given him as a dowry
4583	metamorphoses	 When Venulus had done as Turnus commanded and asked for help, Diomede, Aetolia’s hero, pleaded lack of resources as an excuse: he did not wish to commit himself or his father-in-law’s people, nor had he any men of his own race he could arm
4584	metamorphoses	 ‘So that you do not think that these are lies,’ he said, ‘I will endure the telling of my story patiently, though its mention renews my bitter grief
4585	metamorphoses	" 
"
4586	metamorphoses	When high Ilium had been burned, and Pergama had fed the Greek fires, and when the lesser Ajax, hero of Naryx, had brought down, on us all, the virgin goddess Minerva’s punishment, that he alone deserved, for the rape of virgin Cassandra, we Greeks were taken, and scattered by storms, over the hostile seas
4587	metamorphoses	 We suffered lightning, darkness, and storms, the anger of sea and sky, and Cape Caphereus, the culminating disaster
4588	metamorphoses	 Not to waste time by telling you our sad misfortunes one by one, the Greeks then might even have appeared to warrant Priam’s tears
4589	metamorphoses	 Warrior Minerva’s saving care for me, however, rescued me from the waves
4590	metamorphoses	 But I was driven from my native country again, for gentle Venus, remembering the wound I had once given her, exacted punishment
4591	metamorphoses	 I suffered such great toils in the deep sea, such conflicts on land, that I often called those happy whom the storm that we shared, and the troubled waters of Caphereus, drowned, and I longed to have been one of them
4592	metamorphoses	"’
"
4593	metamorphoses	‘Now my friends lost heart, having endured ultimate misery in war and on the sea, and begged me to end our wanderings
4594	metamorphoses	 But fiery-natured Acmon, truly exasperated by our disasters, said: “What is left, indeed, men, that your patience would not bear? What more could Cytherean Venus do, do you think, if she wished to? When we fear the worst there is a place for prayer, but when our lot is worst, fear is under our feet, and at the height of misfortune we are unconcerned
4595	metamorphoses	 Though she herself should hear me, though she should hate, as she does, all those under Diomede’s command, yet we all scorn her hatred
4596	metamorphoses	 Great powers hardly count as great to us
4597	metamorphoses	"”
"
4598	metamorphoses	Acmon of Pleuron goaded Venus with these insulting words, and rekindled her former anger
4599	metamorphoses	 Few of us approved of what he said: the majority of his friends reproved him, and when he tried to answer, his voice and throat grew attenuated; his hair turned to plumage; and plumage covered his newly formed neck, chest and back
4600	metamorphoses	 His arms received large feathers, and his elbows twisted to form swift wings; his toes took up most of his feet, and his face hardened and stiffened like horn, and ended in a pointed beak
4601	metamorphoses	 Lycus, and Idas, Rhexenor, Nycteus and Abas, marvelled at him, and while they marvelled, they took the same form
4602	metamorphoses	 The larger number of the flock rose, and circled the oarsmen on beating wings
4603	metamorphoses	 If you ask the shape of these suddenly created birds, they were like white swans, though they were not swans
4604	metamorphoses	 Now I can scarcely hold this house, and its parched fields, as Daunus of Iapygia’s son-in-law, with this tiny remnant of my friends
4605	metamorphoses	"’
"
4606	metamorphoses	So said Diomede, grandson of Oeneus of Calydon
4607	metamorphoses	 Venulus left that kingdom passing the Peucetian valleys, and the fields of Messapia
4608	metamorphoses	 Here he came across a cave, dark with trees, and masked by slender reeds, that now is held by the goat-god Pan, but once was held by the nymphs
4609	metamorphoses	 A shepherd from that region of Apulia scared them to flight, at first, suddenly inspiring terror in them
4610	metamorphoses	 When they had collected their wits, scornful of their pursuer, they returned to their dancing, feet skipping to the measure
4611	metamorphoses	The shepherd mocked them, leaping wildly in imitation, and adding foul language, with coarse abuse
4612	metamorphoses	 Nor was his mouth silent till tree-bark imprisoned his throat: he is indeed a tree: you may know its character, by the taste of its fruit that bears the mark of his speech in the wild olives’ bitterness
4613	metamorphoses	 The sharpness of his words has entered them
4614	metamorphoses	When the ambassadors returned, saying that Aetolia’s arms were denied them, the Rutuli pursued war without their help, and much blood was spilled on both sides
4615	metamorphoses	 Turnus attacked the pinewood ships, with devouring fire, and the Trojans feared to lose by fire what the sea had spared
4616	metamorphoses	 Now Mulciber’s flames burned the pitch and wax, and other fuel, and climbed the tall masts to the sails, and the thwarts across the curved hulls were smouldering, when Cybele, the sacred mother of the gods, remembering that these pines were felled on Mount Ida’s summit, filled the air with the clashing throb of bronze cymbals, and the shrilling of boxwood flutes
4617	metamorphoses	 Carried through the clear air by tame lions, she cried out: ‘Turnus, you hurl those firebrands, with sacrilegious hands, in vain! I will save: I will not allow the devouring fire to burn what was part of my woods and belongs to me
4618	metamorphoses	"’
"
4619	metamorphoses	As the goddess spoke it thundered, and, after the thunder, heavy rain, and leaping hail, fell, and the winds, the brothers, sons of Astraeus the Titan by Aurora, troubled the air and the sea, swollen by the sudden onrush, and joined the conflict
4620	metamorphoses	 The all-sustaining mother goddess, used the force of one of them, and broke the hempen cables of the Trojan ships, drove them headlong, and sank them in the deep ocean
4621	metamorphoses	Their rigidity softened, and their wood turned to flesh; the curved sternposts turned into heads; the oars into fingers and legs, swimming; the sides of each vessel became flanks, and the submerged keel down the ship’s middle turned into a spine; the cordage became soft hair, the yards were arms; and their dusky colour was as before
4622	metamorphoses	 Naiads of the waters, they play, in the waves they used to fear, and born on the hills they frequent the gentle sea, and their origin does not affect them
4623	metamorphoses	 Yet not forgetting how many dangers they have often endured on the ocean, they often place their hands beneath storm-tossed boats, unless they have carried Greeks
4624	metamorphoses	 Remembering, as yet, the Trojan disaster, they hate the Pelasgians and with joyful faces they saw the wreckage of Ulysses’s ship, and with joyful faces they saw King Alcinous’s vessel become a rock, its wood turning to stone
4625	metamorphoses	There was hope that the Rutuli, in awe of the wonder of the Trojan fleet being turned into sea-nymphs, would abandon the war
4626	metamorphoses	 It continued, and both sides had gods to help them, and courage that is worth as much as the gods’ assistance
4627	metamorphoses	 Now they were not seeking a kingdom as a dowry, nor a father-in-law’s sceptre, nor you, virgin Lavinia, but to win: and they waged war because they were ashamed to surrender
4628	metamorphoses	 At length Turnus fell, and Venus saw her son’s weapons victorious
4629	metamorphoses	 Ardea fell, spoken of as a power while Turnus lived
4630	metamorphoses	 After the savage fires had destroyed it, and warm ashes buried its houses, a bird flew from the ruins, one now seen for the first time, and beat at the embers with flapping wings
4631	metamorphoses	 Its cry, its leanness, its pallor, everything that fitted the captured city, even its name, ardea, the heron, survived in the bird: and in the beating of its wings, Ardea mourns itself
4632	metamorphoses	Aeneas’s virtues had compelled all the gods, even Juno herself, to bring to an end their ancient feud, and since his young son Julus’s fortunes were firmly founded, Cytherea’s heroic son was ripe for heaven
4633	metamorphoses	 Venus had sought the opinion of the gods, and throwing her arms round her father’s neck, had said ‘You have never been harsh to me, father, now be kindest of all, I beg you
4634	metamorphoses	 Grant my Aeneas, who claims you as his grandfather through my bloodline, some divinity, however little - you choose - so long as you grant him something! It is enough that he once gazed on the hateful kingdom, once crossed the steams of Styx
4635	metamorphoses	’ The gods agreed, and Juno, the royal consort, did not display her severe expression, but consented peacefully
4636	metamorphoses	" Then Jupiter said: ‘You are worthy of this divine gift, you who ask, as is he for whom you ask it: my daughter, possess what you desire!’
"
4637	metamorphoses	The word was spoken: with joy she thanked her father, and drawn by her team of doves through the clear air, she came to the coast of Laurentum, where the waters of the River Numicius, hidden by reeds, wind down to the neighbouring sea
4638	metamorphoses	 She ordered the river-god to cleanse Aeneas, of whatever was subject to death, and bear it away, in his silent course, into the depths of the ocean
4639	metamorphoses	 The horned god executed Venus’s orders, and purged Aeneas of whatever was mortal, and dispersed it on the water: what was best in him remained
4640	metamorphoses	 Once purified, his mother anointed his body with divine perfume, touched his lips with a mixture of sweet nectar and ambrosia, and made him a god, whom the Romans named Indiges, admitting him to their temples and altars
4641	metamorphoses	After that the Alban and Latin kingdom had both names under Ascanius
4642	metamorphoses	 Silvius succeeded him, whose son claimed the name Latinus, with the sceptre
4643	metamorphoses	 The famous Alba followed Latinus, and then Epytus inherited
4644	metamorphoses	 After him came first Capys, and then Capetus
4645	metamorphoses	 Tiberinus inherited the kingdom from them, who, drowning in the waters of that Tuscan stream, gave his name to the River Tiber
4646	metamorphoses	 His sons were Acrota the warrior, and Remulus
4647	metamorphoses	 The elder Remulus was killed by a lightning-bolt, when trying to portray the lightning
4648	metamorphoses	 Acrota, more restrained than his brother, passed the sceptre to brave Aventinus, who lies buried on the very hill where he reigned, and has given his name to it, the Aventine hill
4649	metamorphoses	 And then Proca had the rule of the Palatine people
4650	metamorphoses	Pomona lived in this king’s reign
4651	metamorphoses	 No other hamadryad, of the wood nymphs of Latium, tended the gardens more skilfully or was more devoted to the orchards’ care, hence her name
4652	metamorphoses	 She loved the fields and the branches loaded with ripe apples, not the woods and rivers
4653	metamorphoses	 She carried a curved pruning knife, not a javelin, with which she cut back the luxuriant growth, and lopped the branches spreading out here and there, now splitting the bark and inserting a graft, providing sap from a different stock for the nursling
4654	metamorphoses	 She would not allow them to suffer from being parched, watering, in trickling streams, the twining tendrils of thirsty root
4655	metamorphoses	 This was her love, and her passion, and she had no longing for desire
4656	metamorphoses	 Still fearing boorish aggression, she enclosed herself in an orchard, and denied an entrance, and shunned men
4657	metamorphoses	What did the Satyrs, fitted by their youth for dancing, not do to possess her, and the Pans with pine-wreathed horns, and Silvanus, always younger than his years, and Priapus, the god who scares off thieves, with his pruning hook or his phallus? But Vertumnus surpassed them all, even, in his love, though he was no more fortunate than them
4658	metamorphoses	 O how often, disguised as an uncouth reaper, he would bring her a basket filled with ears of barley, and he was the perfect image of a reaper! Often he would display his forehead bound with freshly cut hay, and might seem to have been tossing the new-mown grass
4659	metamorphoses	 Often he would be carrying an ox-goad in his stiff hand, so that you would swear he had just unyoked his weary team
4660	metamorphoses	 Given a knife he was a dresser and pruner of vines: he would carry a ladder: you would think he’d be picking apples
4661	metamorphoses	 He was a soldier with a sword, or a fisherman taking up his rod
4662	metamorphoses	In short, by his many disguises, he frequently gained admittance, and found joy, gazing at her beauty
4663	metamorphoses	 Once, he even covered his head with a coloured scarf, and leaning on a staff, with a wig of grey hair, imitated an old woman
4664	metamorphoses	 He entered the well-tended garden, and admiring the fruit, said: ‘You are so much more lovely’, and gave her a few congratulatory kisses, as no true old woman would have done
4665	metamorphoses	 He sat on the flattened grass, looking at the branches bending, weighed down with autumn fruit
4666	metamorphoses	 There was a specimen elm opposite, covered with gleaming bunches of grapes
4667	metamorphoses	 After he had praised it, and its companion vine, he said: ‘But if that tree stood there, unmated, without its vine, it would not be sought after for more than its leaves, and the vine also, which is joined to and rests on the elm, would lie on the ground, if it were not married to it, and leaning on it
4668	metamorphoses	But you are not moved by this tree’s example, and you shun marriage, and do not care to be wed
4669	metamorphoses	 I wish that you did! Helen would not have had more suitors to trouble her, or Hippodamia, who caused the Lapithae problems, or Penelope, wife of that Ulysses, who was delayed too long at the war
4670	metamorphoses	 Even now a thousand men want you, and the demi-gods and the gods, and the divinities that haunt the Alban hills, though you shun them and turn away from their wooing
4671	metamorphoses	 But if you are wise, if you want to marry well, and listen to this old woman, that loves you more than you think, more than them all, reject their vulgar offers, and choose Vertumnus to share your bed! You have my assurance as well: he is not better known to himself than he is to me: he does not wander here and there in the wide world: he lives on his own in this place: and he does not love the latest girl he has seen, as most of your suitors do
4672	metamorphoses	You will be his first love, and you will be his last, and he will devote his life only to you
4673	metamorphoses	 And then he is young, is blessed with natural charm, can take on a fitting appearance, and whatever is ordered, though you ask all, he will do
4674	metamorphoses	 Besides, that which you love the same, those apples you cherish, he is the first to have, and with joy holds your gifts in his hand! But he does not desire now the fruit of your trees, or the sweet juice of your herbs: he desires nothing but you
4675	metamorphoses	 Take pity on his ardour, and believe that he, who seeks you, is begging you, in person, through my mouth
4676	metamorphoses	 Fear the vengeful gods, and Idalian Venus, who hates the hard-hearted, and Rhamnusian Nemesis, her inexorable wrath! That you may fear them more (since my long life has given me knowledge of many tales) I will tell you a story, famous through all of Cyprus, by which you might easily be swayed and softened
4677	metamorphoses	"’
"
4678	metamorphoses	‘Once, Iphis, a youth, born of humble stock, saw noble Anaxarete, of the blood of Teucer, saw her, and felt the fire of passion in every bone
4679	metamorphoses	 He fought it for a long time, but when he could not conquer his madness by reason, he came begging at her threshold
4680	metamorphoses	 Now he would confess his sorry love to her nurse, asking her not to be hard on him, by the hopes she had for her darling
4681	metamorphoses	 At other times he flattered each of her many attendants, with enticing words, seeking their favourable disposition
4682	metamorphoses	 Often he gave them messages to carry to her, in the form of fawning letters
4683	metamorphoses	 Sometimes he hung garlands on her doorpost wet with his tears, and lay with his soft flank on the hard threshold, complaining at the pitiless bolts barring the way
4684	metamorphoses	But she spurned, and mocked, him, crueler than the surging sea, when the Kids set; harder than steel tempered in the fires of Noricum; or natural rock still rooted to its bed
4685	metamorphoses	 And she added proud, insolent words to harsh actions, robbing her lover of hope, as well
4686	metamorphoses	 Unable to endure the pain of his long torment, Iphis spoke these last words before her door
4687	metamorphoses	 “You have conquered, Anaxarete, and you will not have to suffer any tedium on my account
4688	metamorphoses	 Devise glad triumphs, and sing the Paean of victory, and wreathe your brow with shining laurel! You have conquered, and I die gladly: now, heart of steel, rejoice! Now you will have something to praise about my love, something that pleases you
4689	metamorphoses	 Remember that my love for you did not end before life itself, and that I lose twin lights in one
4690	metamorphoses	No mere rumour will come to you to announce my death: have no doubt, I myself will be there, visibly present, so you can feast your savage eyes on my lifeless corpse
4691	metamorphoses	 Yet, if you, O gods, see what mortals do, let me be remembered (my tongue can bear to ask for nothing more), and suffer my tale to be told, in future ages, and grant, to my fame, the years, you have taken from my life
4692	metamorphoses	"”
"
4693	metamorphoses	He spoke, and lifted his tear-filled eyes to the doorposts he had often crowned with flowery garlands, and, raising his pale arms to them, tied a rope to the cross-beam, saying: “This wreath will please you, cruel and wicked, as you are!” Then he thrust his head in the noose, though, as he hung there, a pitiful burden, his windpipe crushed, even then he turned towards her
4694	metamorphoses	 The drumming of his feet seemed to sound a request to enter, and when the door was opened it revealed what he had done
4695	metamorphoses	The servants shrieked, and lifted him down, but in vain
4696	metamorphoses	 Then they carried his body to his mother’s house (since his father was dead)
4697	metamorphoses	 She took him to her breast, and embraced her son’s cold limbs, and when she had said all the words a distraught father could say, and done the things distraught mothers do, weeping, she led his funeral procession through the heart of the city, carrying the pallid corpse, on a bier, to the pyre
4698	metamorphoses	The sound of mourning rose to the ears of stony-hearted Anaxarete, her house chancing to be near the street, where the sad procession passed
4699	metamorphoses	 Now a vengeful god roused her
4700	metamorphoses	 Still, she was roused, and said: “Let us see this miserable funeral” and went to a rooftop room with open windows
4701	metamorphoses	 She had barely looked at Iphis, lying on the bier, when her eyes grew fixed, and the warm blood left her pallid body
4702	metamorphoses	 Trying to step backwards she was rooted: trying to turn her face away, also, she could not
4703	metamorphoses	 Gradually the stone that had long existed in her heart possessed her body
4704	metamorphoses	 If you think this is only a tale, Salamis still preserves the image of the lady as a statue, and also possesses a temple of Gazing Venus
4705	metamorphoses	" 
"
4706	metamorphoses	Remember all this, O nymph of mine: put aside, I beg you, reluctant pride, and yield to your lover
4707	metamorphoses	 Then the frost will not sear your apples in the bud, nor the storm winds scatter them in flower
4708	metamorphoses	"’
"
4709	metamorphoses	When Vertumnus, the god, disguised in the shape of the old woman, had spoken, but to no effect, he went back to being a youth, and threw off the dress of an old woman, and appeared to Pomona, in the glowing likeness of the sun, when it overcomes contending clouds, and shines out, unopposed
4710	metamorphoses	 He was ready to force her: but no force was needed, and the nymph captivated by the form of the god, felt a mutual passion
4711	metamorphoses	Now unjust Amulius rules Ausonia, by means of military power, and old Numitor, with his grandson Romulus’s help, captures the kingdom he has lost, and the city of Rome is founded, on the day of the Palilia
4712	metamorphoses	The Sabine leaders, and their king Tatius, wage war, and Tarpeia who gives them access to the citadel, is punished as she deserves, stripped of her life, crushed by a heap of weapons
4713	metamorphoses	Then the men of Cures, with hushed voices, silently, like wolves, overcome the Romans, whose bodies are lost in sleep, and attempt the gates that Romulus, son of Ilia, has closed, and firmly barred
4714	metamorphoses	Saturnian Juno herself unbarred a gate, opening it silently on its hinges
4715	metamorphoses	 Only Venus saw that the gate’s bars had dropped, and would have closed it, except that one god is never allowed to reverse the actions of another
4716	metamorphoses	The Ausonian Naiads, owned a spot, adjoining the temple of Janus, moistened by a cold spring
4717	metamorphoses	 Venus asked them for help: the nymphs did not refuse her just request, and elicited the aid of the streams, and watercourses, belonging to their fountain
4718	metamorphoses	 But the pass of Janus was still not blocked, and the water did not bar the way: they placed yellow sulphur under their copious spring, and heated the hollow channels with burning pitch
4719	metamorphoses	" By these and other means the vapour penetrated the depths of the spring, and you waters that a moment ago dared to compete with Alpine coldness, now did not concede to fire itself!
"
4720	metamorphoses	The twin gateposts smouldered under a fiery spray, and the gate, that vainly promised an entrance to the tough Sabines, was blocked by the new waters, while the Roman soldiers took up their weapons of war
4721	metamorphoses	After this Romulus sallied out, and the Roman soil was strewn with the Sabine dead, and with Rome’s own, and the impious sword mixed the blood of son-in-law with the blood of father-in-law
4722	metamorphoses	 Yet it was decided not to fight it out to the end, to let peace end war, and that Tatius should share the rule of Rome
4723	metamorphoses	Tatius died, and you, Romulus, gave orders equally to both peoples
4724	metamorphoses	 Mars, removing his helmet, addressed the father of gods and men in these words: ‘The time has come, lord, to grant the reward (that you promised to me and your deserving grandson), since the Roman state is strong, on firm foundations, and does not depend on a single champion: free his spirit, and raising him from earth set him in the heavens
4725	metamorphoses	 You once said to me, in person, at a council of the gods (since I am mindful of the gracious words I noted in my retentive mind), ‘There will be one whom you will raise to azure heaven
4726	metamorphoses	"’ Let your words be ratified in full!’
"
4727	metamorphoses	Omnipotent Jupiter nodded, and, veiling the sky with dark clouds, he terrified men on earth with thunder and lightning
4728	metamorphoses	 Mars knew this as a sign that ratified the promised ascension, and leaning on his spear, he vaulted, fearlessly, into his chariot, the horses straining at the blood-wet pole, and cracked the loud whip
4729	metamorphoses	 Dropping headlong through the air, he landed on the summit of the wooded Palatine
4730	metamorphoses	 There he caught up Romulus, son of Ilia, as he was dealing royal justice to his people
4731	metamorphoses	 The king’s mortal body dissolved in the clear atmosphere, like the lead bullet, that often melts in mid-air, hurled by the broad thong of a catapult
4732	metamorphoses	 Now he has beauty of form, and he is Quirinus, clothed in ceremonial robes, such a form as is worthier of the sacred high seats of the gods
4733	metamorphoses	His wife, Hersilia, was mourning him as lost, when royal Juno ordered Iris to descend to her, by her rainbow path, and carry these commands, to the widowed queen: ‘O lady, glory of the Latin and Sabine peoples, worthy before to have been the wife of so great a hero, and now of Quirinus, dry your tears, and if it is your desire to see your husband, follow me and seek the grove, that flourishes on the Quirinal hill and shades the temple of Rome’s king
4734	metamorphoses	"’

4735	metamorphoses	Iris obeyed, and gliding to earth along her many-coloured arch addressed Hersilia as she had been ordered
4736	metamorphoses	 She, hardly raising her eyes, replied, modestly: ‘O goddess (since it is not easy for me to say who you are, but it is clear you are a goddess), lead on: O, lead on, and show me my husband’s face
4737	metamorphoses	 If only the fates allow me to see him once, I shall declare I have been received in heaven
4738	metamorphoses	"’
"
4739	metamorphoses	Without delay, she climbed to Romulus’s hill, with Iris, the virgin daughter of Thaumas
4740	metamorphoses	 There a star fell, gliding from sky to earth, and Hersilia, hair set alight by its fire, vanishes with the star in the air
4741	metamorphoses	 The founder of the Roman city receives her in his familiar embrace, and alters her former body and her name, and calls her Hora, who, a goddess now, is one with her Quirinus
4742	metamorphoses	Meanwhile the Romans looked for a leader, to bear the weight of such responsibility, and follow so great a king: Fame, the true harbinger, determined on the illustrious Numa for the throne
4743	metamorphoses	 Not content with knowing the rituals of the Sabine people, with his capable mind he conceived a wider project, and delved into the nature of things
4744	metamorphoses	 His love of these enquiries led him to leave his native Cures, and visit the city of Crotona, to which Hercules was friendly
4745	metamorphoses	 When Numa asked who was the founder of this Greek city on Italian soil, one of the older inhabitants, not ignorant of the past, replied: ‘They say that Hercules, Jupiter’s son, back from the sea with the rich herds of Spain, happily came to the shore of Lacinium, and while his cattle strayed through the tender grass, he entered the house of the great Croton, a not inhospitable roof, and refreshed himself with rest, after his long labours, and, in leaving, said: ‘At a future time, there will be a city here, of your descendants
4746	metamorphoses	"’
"
4747	metamorphoses	And the promise proved true, since there was one Myscelus, the son of Alemon of Argos, dearest to the gods of all his generation
4748	metamorphoses	 Hercules, the club-bearer, leaning over him, spoke to him as he lay in a deep sleep: ‘Rise now, leave your native country: go, find the pebble-filled waves of Aesar!’ and he threatened him with many and fearful things if he did not obey
4749	metamorphoses	 Then the god and sleep vanished together
4750	metamorphoses	 Alemon’s son rose, and, in silence, thought over the vision, fresh in his mind
4751	metamorphoses	 He struggled in himself for a long time over the decision: the god ordered him to go: the law prohibited his going
4752	metamorphoses	 Death was the penalty for the man who wished to change his nationality
4753	metamorphoses	Bright Sol had hidden his shining face in Ocean’s stream, and Night had lifted her starriest face: the same god seemed to appear to him, to admonish him in the same way, and warn of worse and greater punishment if he did not obey
4754	metamorphoses	 He was afraid, and prepared, at once, to transfer the sanctuary of his ancestors to a new place
4755	metamorphoses	 There was talk in the city, and he was brought to trial, for showing contempt for the law
4756	metamorphoses	 When the case against him had been presented, and it was evident the charge was proven, without needing witnesses, the wretched defendant, lifting his face and hands to heaven, cried: ‘O you, whose twelve labours gave you the right to heaven, help me, I beg you! Since you are the reason for my crime
4757	metamorphoses	"’
"
4758	metamorphoses	The ancient custom was to vote using black and white pebbles: the black to condemn: the white to absolve from punishment
4759	metamorphoses	 Now, also, the harsh verdict was determined in this way, and every pebble dropped into the pitiless urn was black: but when the urn was tipped over and the pebbles poured out for the count, their colour had changed from black to white, and, acquitted through the divine power of Hercules, Alemon’s son was freed
4760	metamorphoses	He first gave thanks to that son of Amphitryon, his patron, and with favouring winds set sail on the Ionian Sea
4761	metamorphoses	 He sailed by Neretum, of the Sallentines, Sybaris, and the Spartan colony of Tarentum, the bay of Siris, Crimisa, and the Iapygian fields
4762	metamorphoses	 He had barely passed the lands that overlook those seas, when he came, by destiny, to the mouth of the river Aesar, and near it the tumulus beneath which the earth covered the sacred bones of Croton
4763	metamorphoses	 He founded the city of Crotona there, in the land commanded by the god, and derived the name of the city from him, whom the tumulus held
4764	metamorphoses	 Such were the established beginnings, according to reliable tradition, of that place, and the cause of the city’s being sited on Italian soil
4765	metamorphoses	There was a man here, Pythagoras, a Samian by birth, who had fled Samos and its rulers, and, hating their tyranny, was living in voluntary exile
4766	metamorphoses	 Though the gods were far away, he visited their region of the sky, in his mind, and what nature denied to human vision he enjoyed with his inner eye
4767	metamorphoses	" When he had considered every subject through concentrated thought, he communicated it widely in public teaching the silent crowds, who listened in wonder to his words, concerning the origin of the vast universe, and of the causes of things; and what the physical world is; what the gods are; where the snows arise; what the origin of lightning is; whether Jupiter, or the storm-winds, thunder from colliding clouds; what shakes the earth; by what laws the stars move; and whatever else is hidden; and he was the first to denounce the serving of animal flesh at table; the first voice, wise but not believed in, to say, for example, in words like these :
"
4768	metamorphoses	‘Human beings, stop desecrating your bodies with impious foodstuffs
4769	metamorphoses	 There are crops; there are apples weighing down the branches; and ripening grapes on the vines; there are flavoursome herbs; and those that can be rendered mild and gentle over the flames; and you do not lack flowing milk; or honey fragrant from the flowering thyme
4770	metamorphoses	 The earth, prodigal of its wealth, supplies you with gentle sustenance, and offers you food without killing or shedding blood
4771	metamorphoses	Flesh satisfies the wild beast’s hunger, though not all of them, since horses, sheep and cattle live on grasses, but those that are wild and savage: Armenian tigers, raging lions, and wolves and bears, enjoy food wet with blood
4772	metamorphoses	" Oh, how wrong it is for flesh to be made from flesh; for a greedy body to fatten, by swallowing another body; for one creature to live by the death of another creature! So amongst such riches that earth, the greatest of mothers, yields, you are not happy unless you tear, with cruel teeth, at pitiful wounds, recalling Cyclops’s practice, and you cannot satisfy your voracious appetite, and your restless hunger, unless you destroy other life!
"
4773	metamorphoses	But that former age, that we call golden, was happy with the fruit from the trees, and the herbs the earth produced, and did not defile its lips with blood
4774	metamorphoses	 Then birds winged their way through the air in safety, and hares wandered, unafraid, among the fields, and its own gullibility did not hook the fish: all was free from trickery, and fearless of any guile, and filled with peace
4775	metamorphoses	 But once someone, whoever he was, the author of something unfitting, envied the lion’s prey, and stuffed his greedy belly with fleshy food, he paved the way for crime
4776	metamorphoses	 It may be that, from the first, weapons were warm and bloodstained from the killing of wild beasts, but that would have been enough: I admit that creatures that seek our destruction may be killed without it being a sin, but while they may be killed, they still should not be eaten
4777	metamorphoses	From that, the wickedness spread further, and it is thought that the pig was first considered to merit slaughter because it rooted up the seeds with its broad snout, and destroyed all hope of harvest
4778	metamorphoses	 The goat was led to death, at the avenging altar, for browsing the vines of Bacchus
4779	metamorphoses	" These two suffered for their crimes! What did you sheep do, tranquil flocks, born to serve man, who bring us sweet milk in full udders, who give us your wool to make soft clothing, who give us more by your life than you grant us by dying? What have the oxen done, without guile or deceit, harmless, simple, born to endure labour?
"
4780	metamorphoses	He is truly thankless, and not worthy of the gift of corn, who could, in a moment, remove the weight of the curved plough, and kill his labourer, striking that work-worn neck with his axe, that has helped turn the hard earth as many times as the earth yielded harvest
4781	metamorphoses	 It is not enough to have committed such wickedness: they involve the gods in crime, and believe that the gods above delight in the slaughter of suffering oxen! A victim of outstanding beauty, and without blemish (since to be pleasing is harmful), distinguished by sacrificial ribbons and gold, is positioned in front of the altar, listens unknowingly to the prayers, and sees the corn it has laboured to produce scattered between its horns, and, struck down, stains with blood those knives that it has already caught sight of, perhaps, reflected in the clear water
4782	metamorphoses	Immediately they inspect the lungs, ripped from the still-living chest, and from them find out the will of the gods
4783	metamorphoses	 On this (so great is man’s hunger for forbidden food) you feed, O human race! Do not, I beg you, and concentrate your minds on my admonitions! When you place the flesh of slaughtered cattle in your mouths, know and feel, that you are devouring your fellow-creature
4784	metamorphoses	"’
"
4785	metamorphoses	‘Now, since a god moves my lips, I will follow, with due rite, the god who moves those lips, and reveal my beloved Delphi and the heavens themselves, and unlock the oracles of that sublime mind
4786	metamorphoses	 I will speak of mighty matters, not fathomed by earlier greatness, things long hidden
4787	metamorphoses	" I delight in journeying among the distant stars: I delight in leaving earth and its dull spaces, to ride the clouds; to stand on the shoulders of mighty Atlas, looking down from far off on men, wandering here and there, devoid of knowledge, anxious, fearing death; to read the book of fate, and to give them this encouragement!
"
4788	metamorphoses	O species, stunned by your terror of chill death, why fear the Styx, why fear the ghosts and empty names, the stuff of poets, the spectres of a phantom world? Do not imagine you can suffer any evil, whether your bodies are consumed by the flames of the funeral pyre, or by wasting age! Souls are free from death, and always, when they have left their previous being, they live in new dwelling-places, and inhabit what received them
4789	metamorphoses	 I myself (for I remember) was Euphorbus, son of Panthoüs, at the time of the Trojan War, in whose chest was pinned the heavy spear of the lesser Atrides, Menelaüs
4790	metamorphoses	" I recognised the shield I used to carry on my left arm, recently, in the temple of Juno at Argos, city of Abas!
"
4791	metamorphoses	Everything changes, nothing dies: the spirit wanders, arriving here or there, and occupying whatever body it pleases, passing from a wild beast into a human being, from our body into a beast, but is never destroyed
4792	metamorphoses	 As pliable wax, stamped with new designs, is no longer what it was; does not keep the same form; but is still one and the same; I teach that the soul is always the same, but migrates into different forms
4793	metamorphoses	" So, I say as a seer, cease to make kindred spirits homeless, by wicked slaughter: do not let blood be nourished by blood!’
"
4794	metamorphoses	‘Since I have embarked on the wide ocean, and given full sails to the wind, I say there is nothing in the whole universe that persists
4795	metamorphoses	 Everything flows, and is formed as a fleeting image
4796	metamorphoses	 Time itself, also, glides, in its continual motion, no differently than a river
4797	metamorphoses	 For neither the river, nor the swift hour can stop: but as wave impels wave, and as the prior wave is chased by the coming wave, and chases the one before, so time flees equally, and, equally, follows, and is always new
4798	metamorphoses	 For what was before is left behind: and what was not comes to be: and each moment is renewed
4799	metamorphoses	You see the nights’ traverses tend towards day, and brilliant light follow the dark of night
4800	metamorphoses	 The sky has a different colour when all weary things are at rest, at midnight, than when bright Lucifer appears on his white charger, and alters again when Aurora, herald of the dawn, stains the world she bequeaths to Phoebus
4801	metamorphoses	 The shield of the god himself is red, when it rises from beneath the earth, and still red, when it is hidden below the earth, again: but is white at the zenith, because there the atmosphere is purer, and it escapes far from the contagion of earth
4802	metamorphoses	 And Diana, the moon, can never have the same or similar form, and is always less today than tomorrow if her orb is waxing, greater if it is waning
4803	metamorphoses	"’
"
4804	metamorphoses	‘Do you not see that the year displays four aspects, passing through them, in a semblance of our life? For spring, in its new life, is tender and sap-filled, and like a child: then the shoots are fresh and growing, delicate, without substance, quickening the farmer’s hopes
4805	metamorphoses	 Then everything blossoms, the kindly land is a riot of brightly coloured flowers, but the leaves are still not strong
4806	metamorphoses	 From spring, the year, grown stronger, moves to summer, and becomes a powerful man: no season is sturdier, or more expansive, than this, or shines more richly
4807	metamorphoses	 Autumn comes, when the ardour of youth has gone, ripe and mellow, between youth and age, a scattering of grey on its forehead
4808	metamorphoses	 Then trembling winter, with faltering steps, its hair despoiled, or, what it has, turned white
4809	metamorphoses	And our bodies themselves are always, restlessly, changing: we shall not be, tomorrow, what we were, or what we are
4810	metamorphoses	 There was a time when we were hidden in our first mother’s womb, only the seed and promise of a human being: nature applied her skilful hands, and, unwilling for our bodies to be buried, cramped in our mother’s swollen belly, expelled us from our home, into the empty air
4811	metamorphoses	 Born into the light, the infant lay there, powerless: but soon it scrambled on all fours like a wild creature, then, gradually, helped by a supporting harness, it stood, uncertainly, on shaky legs
4812	metamorphoses	 From that point, it grew strong and swift, and passed through its span of youth
4813	metamorphoses	When the middle years are also done, life takes the downward path of declining age
4814	metamorphoses	 Milon, the athlete, grown old, cries when he looks at those weak and flabby arms that were once like those of Hercules, a solid mass of muscle
4815	metamorphoses	 Helen, the daughter of Tyndareus, also weeps, when she sees an old woman’s wrinkles in the glass, and asks why she has been twice ravaged
4816	metamorphoses	" Devouring Time, and you, jealous Age, consume everything, and slowly gnawing at them, with your teeth, little by little, consign all things to eternal death!’
"
4817	metamorphoses	‘Even the things we call elements do not persist
4818	metamorphoses	 Apply your concentration, and I will teach the changes they pass through
4819	metamorphoses	 The everlasting universe contains four generative states of matter
4820	metamorphoses	 Of these, two, earth and water, are heavy, and sink lower, under their own weight
4821	metamorphoses	 The other two lack heaviness, and, if not held down, they seek height: that is air, and fire, purer than air
4822	metamorphoses	 Though they are distinct in space, nevertheless they are all derived from one another, and resolve into one another
4823	metamorphoses	 Earth, melting, is dilated to clear water: the moisture, rarified, changes to wind and air: then air, losing further weight, in the highest regions shines out as fire, the most rarified of all
4824	metamorphoses	 Then they return, in reverse, revealing the same series of changes
4825	metamorphoses	 Since fire, condenses, turns into denser air, and this to water, and water, contracted, solidifies as earth
4826	metamorphoses	Nothing keeps its own form, and Nature, the renewer of things, refreshes one shape from another
4827	metamorphoses	 Believe me, nothing dies in the universe as a whole, but it varies and changes its aspect, and what we call ‘being born’ is a beginning to be, of something other, than what was before, and ‘dying’ is, likewise, ending a former state
4828	metamorphoses	 Though, ‘that’ perhaps is transferred here, and ‘this’, there, the total sum is constant
4829	metamorphoses	For my part, I would have thought that nothing lasts for long with the same appearance
4830	metamorphoses	 So the ages changed from gold to iron, and so the fortunes of places have altered
4831	metamorphoses	 I have seen myself what was once firm land become the sea: I have seen earth made from the waters: and seashells lie far away from the ocean, and an ancient anchor has been found on a mountaintop
4832	metamorphoses	 The down rush of waters has made what was once a plain into a valley, and hills, by the deluge have been washed to the sea
4833	metamorphoses	 Marshy land has drained to parched sand, and what was once thirsty ground filled with a marshy pool
4834	metamorphoses	Here, Nature generates fresh springs, and there seals them up, and rivers, released by deep earthquakes, burst out or dry up, and sink
4835	metamorphoses	 So when the Lycus is swallowed by a chasm in the earth, it emerges far off, reborn, from a different source
4836	metamorphoses	 So, engulfed, flowing as a hidden stream, the mighty Erasinus emerges again, in the fields of Argos
4837	metamorphoses	 And they say that Mysus, ashamed of its origin and its former banks, now flows elsewhere, as Caicus
4838	metamorphoses	 Amenanus flows sometimes churning Sicilian sands, at other times dried up, its fountains blocked
4839	metamorphoses	 Anigrus, once drinkable, now flows with water you would not wish to touch, since, unless we deny all credence to the poets, the bi-formed centaurs washed their wounds there, dealt by the bow of club-bearing Hercules
4840	metamorphoses	" Is the Hypanis, born in the Scythian mountains, not ruined by bitter saltwater, that once was sweet?
"
4841	metamorphoses	Antissa, and Pharos, and Phoenician Tyre, were surrounded by sea: of which not one, now, is an island
4842	metamorphoses	 The former settlers of Leucas lived on a peninsula: now the waves encircle it
4843	metamorphoses	 Zancle also is said to have been joined to Italy, till the waves washed away the boundary, and the deep sea pushed back the land
4844	metamorphoses	 If you look for Helice and Buris, cities of Achaia, you will find them under the waters, and sailors are accustomed, even now, to point out the submerged towns with their sunken walls
4845	metamorphoses	There is a mound near Troezen, where Pittheus ruled, steep and treeless, that once was the flattest open space on the plain, and now is a mound
4846	metamorphoses	 For (strange to relate) the wild strength of the winds, imprisoned in dark caves, longing for somewhere to breathe, and struggling in vain to enjoy the freer expanses of sky, since there was no gap at all in their prison, as an exit for their breath, extended and swelled the ground, just as a man inflates a bladder, or a goatskin taken from a twin-horned goat

4851	metamorphoses	The Cicones have a river, whose waters when drunk turn the vital organs to stone, and that change things to marble when touched
4852	metamorphoses	 The Crathis, and the Sybaris, here, near our own country, make hair like amber or gold: and what is more amazing, there are streams that have power to change not merely the body but the mind as well
4853	metamorphoses	 Who has not heard of the disgusting waves of Salmacis, and the Aethiopian lakes? Whoever wets his throat with these, is either maddened, or falls into a strange, deep sleep
4854	metamorphoses	Whoever slakes his thirst at Clitor’s fountain, shuns wine, and only enjoys pure water, whether it is due to a power in the water that counteracts hot wine, or whether, as the natives claim, Melampus, Amythaon’s son, when he had saved the demented daughters of Proetus from madness, by herbs and incantations, threw the remnants of what had purged their minds into its springs, and the antipathy to wine was left behind in its waters
4855	metamorphoses	 The flow of the River Lyncestius has the opposite effect, so that whoever drinks even moderately of it, stumbles about, as if they had drunk pure wine
4856	metamorphoses	 There is a place in Arcadia, the ancients called Pheneus, mistrusted for its dual-natured waters: beware of them at night, drunk at night they are harmful: in the day they can be drunk without harm
4857	metamorphoses	 So, rivers and lakes can harbour some power or other
4858	metamorphoses	There was a time when Ortygia floated on the waves, now it is fixed, and the Argo’s crew feared the Symphlegades’ collisions, and the spray of their crashing waves, islands that now stand there motionless, and resist the winds
4859	metamorphoses	And Aetna that glows, with its sulphurous furnaces, was not always on fire, and will not always be on fire
4860	metamorphoses	 For if the earth is a creature that lives, and, in many places, has vents that breathe out flame, she can alter her air passages, and as frequently as she shifts, she can close these caverns and open others
4861	metamorphoses	 Or, if swift winds are confined in the deep caves, and strike rock against rock, or against material containing the seeds of fire, and Aetna catches alight from the friction, the caves will be left cold when the wind dies
4862	metamorphoses	 Or, if it is bituminous substances that take fire, and yellow sulphur, burning with little smoke, then, when the ground no longer provides rich fuel, or nourishment for the flames, and their strength fails after long centuries, earth herself will lack the support of devouring nature, and will not withstand that famine, and forsaken, will forsake her fires
4863	metamorphoses	There is a tale of men in Hyperborean Pallene, who are used to clothing their bodies in soft plumage, by plunging nine times in Minerva’s pool: for my part, I can scarcely believe it: also the women of Scythia are said to practise the same arts, sprinkling their bodies with magic liquids

4865	metamorphoses	‘However if trust is only placed in proven things, do you not see that whenever corpses putrefy, due to time or melting heat, they generate tiny creatures? Bury the carcases of sacrificed bulls (it is a known experiment) in the ditch where you have thrown them, and flower-sipping bees will be born, here and there, from the putrid entrails
4866	metamorphoses	 After the custom of their parent bodies, they frequent the fields, are devoted to work, and labour in hope of harvest
4867	metamorphoses	A war-horse dug into the earth is the source of hornets
4868	metamorphoses	 If you remove the hollow claws of land-crabs, and put the rest under the soil, a scorpion, with its curved and threatening tail, will emerge from the parts interred: and the caterpillars that are accustomed to weave their white cocoons on uncultivated leaves (a thing observed by farmers) change to a butterfly’s form, symbol of the soul
4869	metamorphoses	Mud contains the generative seeds of green frogs, and generates them without legs, soon giving them legs for swimming, and, at the same time, with hind legs longer than their forelegs, so that they are fit to take long leaps
4870	metamorphoses	 The cub that a she-bear has just produced is not a cub but a scarcely living lump of flesh: the mother gives it a body, by licking it, and shapes it into a form like that she has herself
4871	metamorphoses	" Do you not see how the larvae of the honey-carrying bees, protected by the hexagonal waxen cells, are born as limbless bodies, and later acquire legs, and later still wings?

There are those who believe that when the spine decomposes, interred in the tomb, human marrow forms a snake

4877	metamorphoses	 When it has lived for five centuries, it then builds a nest for itself in the topmost branches of a swaying palm tree, using only its beak and talons
4878	metamorphoses	 As soon as it has lined it with cassia bark, and smooth spikes of nard, cinnamon fragments and yellow myrrh, it settles on top, and ends its life among the perfumes
4879	metamorphoses	They say that, from the father’s body, a young phoenix is reborn, destined to live the same number of years
4880	metamorphoses	 When age has given it strength, and it can carry burdens, it lightens the branches of the tall palm of the heavy nest, and piously carries its own cradle, that was its father’s tomb, and, reaching the city of Hyperion, the sun-god, through the clear air, lays it down in front of the sacred doors of Hyperion’s temple
4881	metamorphoses	If there is anything to marvel at, however, in these novelties, we might marvel at how the hyena changes function, and a moment ago a female, taken from behind by a male, is now a male
4882	metamorphoses	 Also that animal, the chameleon, fed by wind and air, instantly adopts the colour of whatever it touches
4883	metamorphoses	Vanquished India gave lynxes to Bacchus of the clustered vines, and, they say that, whatever their bladder emits changes to stone, and solidifies on contact with air

4893	metamorphoses	 As I remember also, when the Trojan State was falling, Helenus, son of Priam, said to a weeping Aeneas, who was unsure of his future: “Son of the goddess, if you take careful heed, of what my mind prophesies, Troy will not wholly perish while you live! Fire and sword will give way before you: you will go, as one man, catching up, and bearing away Pergama, till you find a foreign land, kinder to you and Troy, than your fatherland

What evil they contrive, how impiously they prepare to shed human blood itself, who rip at a calf’s throat with the knife, and listen unmoved to its bleating, or can kill a kid to eat that cries like a child, or feed on a bird, that they themselves have fed! How far does that fall short of actual murder? Where does the way lead on from there?
"
4903	metamorphoses	Let the ox plough, or owe his death to old age: let the sheep yield wool, to protect against the chill north wind: let the she-goats give you full udders for milking! Have done with nets and traps, snares and the arts of deception! Do not trick the birds with limed twigs, or imprison the deer, scaring them with feathered ropes, or hide barbed hooks in treacherous bait
4904	metamorphoses	 Kill them, if they harm you, but even then let killing be enough
4905	metamorphoses	" Let your mouth be free of their blood, enjoy milder food!’
"
4906	metamorphoses	His mind versed in these and other teachings, it is said that Numa returned to his native country, and took control of Latium, at the people’s request
4907	metamorphoses	 Blessed with a nymph, Egeria, for wife, and guided by the Muses, he taught the sacred rituals, and educated a savage, warlike, race in the arts of peace
4908	metamorphoses	When, in old age, he relinquished his sceptre with his life, the women of Latium, the populace, and the senators wept for the dead Numa: but Egeria, his wife, left the city, and lived in retirement, concealed by dense woods, in the valley of Aricia, and her sighs and lamentations prevented the worship of Oresteian Diana
4909	metamorphoses	" O! How often the nymphs of the lakes and groves admonished her to stop, and spoke words of consolation to her!
"
4910	metamorphoses	How often Hippolytus, Theseus’s heroic son, said to the weeping nymph: ‘Make an end to this, since yours is not the only fate to be lamented: think of others’ like misfortunes: you will endure your own more calmly
4911	metamorphoses	 I wish my own case had no power to lighten your sorrow! But even mine can
4912	metamorphoses	 If your ears have heard anything of Hippolytus, of how, through his father’s credulity, and the deceits of his accursed stepmother, he met his death, though you will be amazed, and I will prove it with difficulty, nevertheless, I am he
4913	metamorphoses	Phaedra, Pasiphaë’s daughter, having tried, vainly, to tempt me to dishonour my father’s bed, deflected guilt, and, (more through fear than anger at being rejected?), made out I had wanted what she wished, and so accused me
4914	metamorphoses	 Not in the least deserving it, I was banished by my father from the city, and called down hostile curses on my head
4915	metamorphoses	Exiled, I headed my chariot towards Troezen, Pittheus’s city, and was travelling the Isthmus, near Corinth, when the sea rose, and a huge mass of water shaped itself into a mountain, and seemed to grow, and give out bellowings, splitting at the summit: from it, a horned bull, emerged, out of the bursting waters, standing up to his chest in the gentle breeze, expelling quantities of seawater from his nostrils and gaping mouth
4916	metamorphoses	 My companions’ hearts were troubled, but my mind stayed unshaken, preoccupied with thoughts of exile, when my fiery horses turned their necks towards the sea, and trembled, with ears pricked, disturbed by fear of the monster, and dragged the chariot, headlong, down the steep cliff
4917	metamorphoses	I struggled, in vain, to control them with the foam-flecked reins, and leaning backwards, strained at the resistant thongs
4918	metamorphoses	 Even then, the horses’ madness would not have exhausted my strength, if a wheel had not broken, and been wrenched off, as the axle hub, round which it revolves, struck a tree
4919	metamorphoses	 I was thrown from the chariot, and, my body entangled in the reins, my sinews caught by the tree, you might have seen my living entrails dragged along, my limbs partly torn away, partly held fast, my bones snapped with a loud crack, and my weary spirit expiring: no part of my body recognisable: but all one wound
4920	metamorphoses	" Now can you compare your tragedy, or dare you, nymph, with mine?
"
4921	metamorphoses	I saw, also, the kingdom without light, and bathed my lacerated body in Phlegethon’s waves: there still, if Apollo’s son, Aesculapius, had not restored me to life with his powerful cures
4922	metamorphoses	 When, despite Dis’s anger, I regained it, by the power of herbs and Paean’s help, Cynthia, created a dense mist round me, so that I might not be seen and increase envy at the gift
4923	metamorphoses	 And she added a look of age, and left me unrecognisable, so that I would be safe, and might be seen with impunity
4924	metamorphoses	 She considered, for a while, whether to give me Crete or Delos to live in: abandoning Delos and Crete, she set me down here, and ordered me to discard my name that might remind me of horses, and said: “You, who were Hippolytus, be also, now, Virbius!” Since then I have lived in this grove, one of the minor deities, and sheltering in the divinity of Diana, my mistress, I am coupled with her
4925	metamorphoses	"’
"
4926	metamorphoses	Egeria’s grief could not be lessened, even by the sufferings of others: prostrate, at the foot of a mountain, she melted away in tears, till Phoebus’s sister, out of pity for her true sorrow, made a cool fountain from her body, and reduced her limbs to unfailing waters
4927	metamorphoses	This strange event amazed the nymphs, and the Amazon’s son was no less astounded, than the Tyrrhenian ploughman when he saw a fateful clod of earth in the middle of his fields first move by itself with no one touching it, then assume the form of a man, losing its earthy nature, and open its newly acquired mouth, to utter things to come
4928	metamorphoses	 The native people called him Tages, he who first taught the Etruscan race to reveal future events
4929	metamorphoses	 No less astounded than Romulus, when he saw his spear, that had once grown on the Palatine Hill, suddenly put out leaves, and stand there, not with its point driven in, but with fresh roots: now not a weapon but a tough willow-tree, giving unexpected shade to those who wondered at it
4930	metamorphoses	No less astounded than Cipus, the praetor, when he saw his horns in the river’s water (truly he saw them) and, thinking it a false likeness of his true form, lifting his hands repeatedly to his forehead, touched what he saw
4931	metamorphoses	 Unable now to resist the evidence of his eyes, he raised his eyes and arms to the sky, like a victor returning from a beaten enemy, and cried: ‘You gods, whatever this unnatural thing portends, if it is happiness, let it be the happiness of my country, and the race of Quirinus: if it is a threat, let it be towards me
4932	metamorphoses	"’
"
4933	metamorphoses	Making a grassy altar of green turf, he appeased the gods with burning incense, and made a libation of wine, and inspected the quivering entrails of sacrificed sheep, as to what they portended for him
4934	metamorphoses	 As soon as the Tyrrhenian seer, there, saw them, he recognised the signs of great happenings, not yet manifest, and when indeed he raised his keen eyes from the sheep’s entrails to Cipus’s forehead, he cried: ‘Hail! O King! You, even you, Cipus, and your horns, this place, and Latium’s citadels, shall obey
4935	metamorphoses	 Only no delay: hurry and enter the open gates! So fate commands: and received in the city, you will be king, and safely possess the eternal sceptre
4936	metamorphoses	"’
"
4937	metamorphoses	Cipus drew back, and grimly turning his face away from the city’s walls, he said: ‘Oh, let the gods keep all such things, far, far away, from me! Far better for me to spend my life in exile, than for the Capitol to see me crowned!’ He spoke, and immediately called together the people and the grave senators
4938	metamorphoses	 First however he hid his horns with the laurels of peace, then standing on a mound raised by resolute soldiers, and praying to the ancient gods as customary, he said: ‘There is a man here who shall be king, unless you drive him from the city
4939	metamorphoses	 I will show you who he is, not by name, but by a sign: he wears horns on his forehead! The augur declares that if he enters Rome, he will grant you only the rights of slaves
4940	metamorphoses	 He could have forced his way in, through the open gates, but I opposed it, though no one is more closely connected to him than me
4941	metamorphoses	" Quirites, keep the man out of your city, and, if he deserves it, load him with heavy chains, or end all fear, with the death of this fated tyrant!’
"
4942	metamorphoses	There was a sound from the crowd, like the murmur from the pine-trees when the wild East wind whistles through them, or like the waves of the sea, heard from far off: but among the confused cries of the noisy throng, one rang out: ‘Who is he?’ They looked at each other’s forehead looking for the horns foretold
4943	metamorphoses	 Cipus spoke to them again: ‘You have here, whom you seek,’ and, taking the wreath from his head, the people trying to prevent him, he showed them his temples, conspicuous by their twin horns
4944	metamorphoses	 They all sighed, and lowered their eyes (who could believe it?) and were reluctant to look at that distinguished head
4945	metamorphoses	 Not allowing him any longer to be dishonoured, they replaced the festal wreath
4946	metamorphoses	But since you were forbidden to enter the city, Cipus, they gave you, as an honour, as much land as you could enclose, with a team of oxen, harnessed to the plough, between dawn and sunset
4947	metamorphoses	 And they engraved horns on the bronze gateposts, recalling their marvellous nature, to remain there through the centuries
4948	metamorphoses	You Muses, goddesses present to poets, reveal now (since you know, and spacious time cannot betray you) where Aesculapius, son of Coronis, came from, to be joined to the gods of Romulus’s city, that the deep Tiber flows around
4949	metamorphoses	Once, plague tainted the air of Latium, and people’s bodies were ravaged by disease, pallid and bloodless
4950	metamorphoses	 When they saw that their efforts were useless, and medical skill was useless, wearied with funeral rites, they sought help from the heavens, and travelled to Delphi, set at the centre of the earth, to the oracle of Phoebus, and prayed that he would aid them, in their misery, by a health-giving prophecy, and end their great city’s evil
4951	metamorphoses	 The ground, the laurel-tree, and the quiver he holds himself, trembled together, and the tripod responded with these words, from the innermost sanctuary, troubling their fearful minds: ‘You should have looked in a nearer place, Romans, for what you seek here: even now, look for it from that nearer place: your help is not from Apollo, to lessen your pain, but Apollo’s son
4952	metamorphoses	 Go, with good omens, and fetch my child
4953	metamorphoses	"’
"
4954	metamorphoses	When the Senate, in its wisdom, heard the god’s command, it made enquiries as to the city where Phoebus’s son lived, and sent an embassy to sail to the coast of Epidaurus
4955	metamorphoses	 As soon as the curved ship touched shore, the embassy went to the council of Greek elders, and begged them to give up the god, who, by his presence, might prevent the death of the Ausonian race: so the oracle truly commanded
4956	metamorphoses	 They disagreed, and were of various minds: some thought that help could not be refused: the majority recommended the god should be kept, and their own wealth not released, or surrendered
4957	metamorphoses	While they wavered, as dusk dispelled the lingering light, and darkness covered the countries of the earth with shadow, then, in your dreams, Aesculapius, god of healing, seemed to stand before your bed, Roman, just as he is seen in his temple, holding a rustic staff in his left hand, and stroking his long beard with his right, and with a calm voice, speaking these words: ‘Have no fear! I will come, and I will leave a statue of myself behind
4958	metamorphoses	 Take a good look at this snake, that winds, in knots, round my staff, and keep it in your sight continually, until you know it! I will change into this, but greater in size, seeming as great as a celestial body should be when it changes
4959	metamorphoses	’ The god vanished with the voice, at once: and sleep, with the voice, and the god: and as sleep fled, kind day dawned
4960	metamorphoses	When morning had put the bright stars to flight, the leaders, still unsure what to do, gathered at the temple complex of that god whom the Romans sought, and begged him to show them by some divine token where he himself wanted to live
4961	metamorphoses	 They had hardly ceased speaking, when the golden god, in the likeness of a serpent with a tall crest, gave out a hiss as a harbinger of his presence, and by his coming, rocked the statue, the doors, the marble pavement, and the gilded roof
4962	metamorphoses	 Then he stopped, in the middle of the temple, raising himself breast-high, and gazed round, with eyes flashing fire
4963	metamorphoses	The terrified crowd trembled, but the priest, his sacred locks tied with a white band, knew the divine one, and cried: ‘The god, behold, it is the god! Restrain your minds and tongues, whoever is here! Let the sight of you, O most beautiful one, work for us, and help the people worshipping at your shrine!’ Whoever was there, worshipped the god, as they were told, and all re-echoed the priest’s words, and the Romans gave dutiful support, with mind and voice
4964	metamorphoses	The god nodded, and shook his crest, confirming his favour, by hissing three times in succession, with his flickering tongue
4965	metamorphoses	 Then he glided down the gleaming steps, and turning his head backwards, gazed at the ancient altars he was abandoning, and saluted his accustomed house, and the temple where he had lived
4966	metamorphoses	 From there the vast serpent slid over the flower-strewn ground, flexing his body, and made his way through the city centre to the harbour, protected by its curved embankment
4967	metamorphoses	 He halted there, and, appearing to dismiss the dutiful throng, with a calm expression, settled his body down in the Ausonian ship
4968	metamorphoses	 It felt the divine burden, and the keel sank under the god’s weight
4969	metamorphoses	 The Romans were joyful, and, sacrificing a bull on the shore, they loosed the twisted cables of their wreath-crowned ship
4970	metamorphoses	 A gentle breeze drove the vessel: the god arching skyward, rested his neck heavily on the curving sternpost, and gazed at the dark blue waters
4971	metamorphoses	With gentle breezes he reached Italy, over the Ionian Sea, on the sixth morning
4972	metamorphoses	 He passed the shores of Lacinium, famous for Juno’s temple, and Scylaceum; he left Iapygia, and avoided the rocks of Amphrisia to larboard, the cliffs of Cocinthia to starboard; he coasted by Romethium, by Caulon and Narycia: he passed the narrow strait of Sicilian Pelorus, and the home of King Aeolus, and the mines of Temese, and headed for Leucosia and the rose-gardens of gentle Paestum
4973	metamorphoses	From there he skirted Capri, and Minerva’s promontory, and Surrentum’s hills well-stocked with vines, Herculaneum, Stabiae, and Parthenope, born for idleness, and headed for the temple of the Cumean Sibyl
4974	metamorphoses	 By Baiae’s hot pools; and Liternum’s lentisk trees; and the River Volturnus, dragging quantities of sand along in its floodwaters; and Sinuessa, frequented by white doves; and unhealthy Minturnae; and Caïeta, named after her whom Aeneas her foster-son buried; and the home of Antiphates; and marsh-surrounded Trachas; and Circe’s land; and Antium’s firm shore
4975	metamorphoses	When the sailors steered their ship, under sail, to the place (since the sea was now rough) the god unwound his coils, and gliding along, fold after fold, in giant curves, entered his father Apollo’s temple, bordering the yellow strand
4976	metamorphoses	 When the sea was calm, the Epidaurian left the paternal altars, and having enjoyed the hospitality of his divine father, furrowed the sandy shore as he dragged his rasping scales along, and climbing the rudder, rested his head on the ship’s high sternpost, until he came to Castrum, the sacred city of Lavinium, and the Tiber’s mouths
4977	metamorphoses	All the people, men and women alike, had come thronging from every side, in a crowd, to meet him, along with those who serve your flames, Trojan Vesta, and they hailed the god with joyful cries
4978	metamorphoses	 As the swift ship sailed up-stream, incense burned with a crackling sound on a series of altars on either bank, and the fumes perfumed the air, and the slaughtered victims bled heat on the sacrificial knives
4979	metamorphoses	Now it entered Rome, the capital of the world
4980	metamorphoses	 The snake stood erect, and resting his neck on the mast’s summit, turned, and looked for places fit for him to live
4981	metamorphoses	 The river splits here into two branches, flowing round what is named the Island, stretching its two arms out equally on both sides, with the land between
4982	metamorphoses	 There the serpent-child of Phoebus landed, and, resuming his divine form, made an end to grief, and came as a health-giver to the city
4983	metamorphoses	Though Aesculapius came as a stranger to our temples, Caesar is a god in his own city
4984	metamorphoses	 Outstanding in war or peace, it was not so much his wars that ended in great victories, or his actions at home, or his swiftly won fame, that set him among the stars, a fiery comet, as his descendant
4985	metamorphoses	 There is no greater achievement among Caesar’s actions than that he stood father to our emperor
4986	metamorphoses	 Is it a greater thing to have conquered the sea-going Britons; to have led his victorious ships up the seven-mouthed flood of the papyrus-bearing Nile; to have brought the rebellious Numidians, under Juba of Cinyps, and Pontus, swollen with the name of Mithridates, under the people of Quirinus; to have earned many triumphs and celebrated few; than to have sponsored such a man, with whom, as ruler of all, you gods have richly favoured the human race? Therefore, in order for the emperor not to have been born of mortal seed, Caesar needed to be made a god
4987	metamorphoses	When Venus, the golden mother of Aeneas, saw this, and also saw that a grim death was being readied for Caesar, her high-priest, and an armed conspiracy was under way, she grew pale and said to every god in turn: ‘See the nest of tricks being prepared against me, and with what treachery that life is being attacked, all that is left to me of Trojan Iülus
4988	metamorphoses	 Will I be the only one always to be troubled by well-founded anxiety: now Diomede’s Calydonian spear wounds me: now the ill-defended walls of Troy confound me, seeing my son Aeneas driven to endless wandering, storm-tossed, entering the silent house of shadows, waging war against Turnus, or, if we speak the truth, with Juno, rather? Why do I recall, now, the ancient sufferings of my race? This present fear inhibits memory of the past: look at those evil knives being sharpened
4989	metamorphoses	" Prevent them, I beg you, thwart this attempt, and do not allow Vesta’s flames to be quenched by the blood of her priest!’
"
4990	metamorphoses	Venus in her anxiety voiced her fears throughout the heavens, but in vain, troubling the gods, who though they could not break the iron rules of the ancient sisters, nevertheless gave no uncertain omens of imminent disaster
4991	metamorphoses	 They say weapons, clashing among black clouds, and terrifying trumpets and horns, foretelling crime, were heard from the sky: and that the face of the sun, darkened, gave out a lurid light, over the troubled earth
4992	metamorphoses	 Often, firebrands were seen, burning in the midst of the stars: often drops of blood rained from the clouds: Lucifer, the morning star, was dulled, with rust-black spots on his disc, and the moon’s chariot was spattered with blood
4993	metamorphoses	The Stygian owl sounded its sad omens in a thousand places: in a thousand places ivory statues wept: and incantations, and warning words, were said to have been heard in the sacred groves
4994	metamorphoses	 No sacrifice was favourable, and the livers were found with cleft lobes, among the entrails, warning of great and impending civil conflict
4995	metamorphoses	 In the forum, and around men’s houses, and the temples of the gods, dogs howled at night, and they say the silent dead walked, and earthquakes shook the city
4996	metamorphoses	 Still the gods’ warnings could not prevent the conspiracy, or fate’s fulfillment
4997	metamorphoses	Drawn swords were carried into the curia, the sacred Senate house: no place in the city would satisfy them as scene for the act of evil murder but this
4998	metamorphoses	 Then in truth Cytherean Venus struck her breast with both hands, and tried to hide Caesar in a cloud, as Paris was once snatched from the attack of Atrides, and Aeneas escaped Diomede’s sword
4999	metamorphoses	" 
"
5000	metamorphoses	Then Jupiter, the father, spoke: ‘Alone, do you think you will move the immoveable fates, daughter? You are allowed yourself to enter the house of the three: there you will see all things written, a vast labour, in bronze and solid iron, that, eternal and secure, does not fear the clashing of the skies, the lightning’s anger, or any forces of destruction
5001	metamorphoses	 There you will find the fate of your descendants cut in everlasting adamant
5002	metamorphoses	 I have read them myself, and taken note of them in my mind, and I will tell you, so that you are no longer blind to the future
5003	metamorphoses	" 
"
5004	metamorphoses	This descendant of yours you suffer over, Cytherean, has fulfilled his time, and the years he owes to earth are done
5005	metamorphoses	 You, and Augustus, his ‘son’, will ensure that he ascends to heaven as a god, and is worshipped in the temples
5006	metamorphoses	 Augustus, as heir to his name, will carry the burden placed upon him alone, and will have us with him, in battle, as the most courageous avenger of his father’s murder
5007	metamorphoses	 Under his command, the conquered walls of besieged Mutina will sue for peace; Pharsalia will know him; Macedonian Philippi twice flow with blood; and the one who holds Pompey’s great name, will be defeated in Sicilian waters; and a Roman general’s Egyptian consort, trusting, to her cost, in their marriage, will fall, her threat that our Capitol would bow to her city of Canopus, proved vain
5008	metamorphoses	"Why enumerate foreign countries, for you or the nations living on either ocean shore? Wherever earth contains habitable land, it will be his: and even the sea will serve him!
"
5009	metamorphoses	When the world is at peace, he will turn his mind to the civil code, and, as the most just of legislators, make law
5010	metamorphoses	 He will direct morality by his own example, and, looking to the future ages and coming generations, he will order a son, Tiberius, born of his virtuous wife, to take his name, and his responsibilities
5011	metamorphoses	 He will not attain his heavenly home, and the stars, his kindred, until he is old, and his years equal his merits
5012	metamorphoses	 Meanwhile take up Caesar’s spirit from his murdered corpse, and change it into a star, so that the deified Julius may always look down from his high temple on our Capitol and forum
5013	metamorphoses	"’
"
5014	metamorphoses	He had barely finished, when gentle Venus stood in the midst of the Senate, seen by no one, and took up the newly freed spirit of her Caesar from his body, and preventing it from vanishing into the air, carried it towards the glorious stars
5015	metamorphoses	 As she carried it, she felt it glow and take fire, and loosed it from her breast: it climbed higher than the moon, and drawing behind it a fiery tail, shone as a star
5016	metamorphoses	Seeing his son’s good works, Caesar acknowledges they are greater than his own, and delights in being surpassed by him
5017	metamorphoses	 Though the son forbids his own actions being honoured above his father’s, nevertheless fame, free and obedient to no one’s orders, exalts him, despite himself, and denies him in this one thing
5018	metamorphoses	 So great Atreus cedes the title to Agamemnon: so Theseus outdoes Aegeus, and Achilles his father Peleus: and lastly, to quote an example worthy of these two, so Saturn is less than Jove
5019	metamorphoses	Jupiter commands the heavenly citadels, and the kingdoms of the threefold universe
5020	metamorphoses	 Earth is ruled by Augustus
5021	metamorphoses	 Each is a father and a master
5022	metamorphoses	" You gods, the friends of Aeneas, to whom fire and sword gave way; you deities of Italy; and Romulus, founder of our city; and Mars, father of Romulus; Vesta, Diana, sacred among Caesar’s ancestral gods, and you, Phoebus, sharing the temple with Caesar’s Vesta; you, Jupiter who hold the high Tarpeian citadel; and all you other gods, whom it is fitting and holy for a poet to invoke, I beg that the day be slow to arrive, and beyond our own lifetimes, when Augustus shall rise to heaven, leaving the world he rules, and there, far off, shall listen, with favour, to our prayers!
"
5023	metamorphoses	And now the work is done, that Jupiter’s anger, fire or sword cannot erase, nor the gnawing tooth of time
5024	metamorphoses	 Let that day, that only has power over my body, end when it will, my uncertain span of years: yet the best part of me will be borne, immortal, beyond the distant stars
5025	metamorphoses	 Wherever Rome’s influence extends, over the lands it has civilized, I will be spoken, on people’s lips: and, famous through all the ages, if there is truth in poets’ prophecies, – vivam – I shall live
