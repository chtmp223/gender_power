The land that was once common to all , as the light of the sun is , and the air , was marked out , to its furthest boundaries , by wary surveyors . Not only did they demand the crops and the food the rich soil owed them , but they entered the bowels of the earth , and excavating brought up the wealth it had concealed in Stygian shade , wealth that incites men to crime . And now harmful iron appeared , and gold more harmful than iron . War came , whose struggles employ both , waving clashing arms with bloodstained hands . They lived on plunder : friend was not safe with friend , relative with relative , kindness was rare between brothers . Husbands longed for the death of their wives , wives for the death of their husbands . Murderous stepmothers mixed deadly aconite , and sons inquired into their father ’s years before their time . Piety was dead , and virgin Astraea , last of all the immortals to depart , herself abandoned the blood - drenched earth .

But these progeny also despising the gods were savage , violent , and eager for slaughter , so that you might know they were born from blood .
1994	2193	1985	1985	he	1555	‘ I was not more troubled than I am now concerning the world ’s sovereignty than when each of the snake - footed giants prepared to throw his hundred arms around the imprisoned sky . Though they were fierce enemies , still their attack came in one body and from one source . Now I must destroy the human race , wherever Nereus sounds , throughout the world . I swear it by the infernal streams , that glide below the earth through the Stygian groves . All means should first be tried , but the incurable flesh must be excised by the knife , so that the healthy part is not infected . Mine are the demigods , the wild spirits , nymphs , fauns and satyrs , and sylvan deities of the hills . Since we have not yet thought them worth a place in heaven let us at least allow them to live in safety in the lands we have given them . Perhaps you gods believe they will be safe , even when Lycaon , known for his savagery , plays tricks against me , who holds the thunderbolt , and reigns over you . ’

When the noise had subsided , quieted by his royal authority , Jupiter again broke the silence with these words : ‘

I gave them signs that a god had come , and the people began to worship me . At first Lycaon ridiculed their piety , then exclaimed ‘
2485	2717	2719	2719	he	1571	’ He planned to destroy me in the depths of sleep , unexpectedly , by night . That is how he resolved to prove the truth . Not satisfied with this he took a hostage sent by the Molossi , opened his throat with a knife , and made some of the still warm limbs tender in seething water , roasting others in the fire . No sooner were these placed on the table than I brought the roof down on the household gods , with my avenging flames , those gods worthy of such a master . He himself ran in terror , and reaching the silent fields howled aloud , frustrated of speech . Foaming at the mouth , and greedy as ever for killing , he turned against the sheep , still delighting in blood . His clothes became bristling hair , his arms became legs . He was a wolf , but kept some vestige of his former shape . There were the same grey hairs , the same violent face , the same glittering eyes , the same savage image . One house has fallen , but others deserve to also . Wherever the earth extends the avenging furies rule . You would think men were sworn to crime ! Let them all pay the penalty they deserve , and quickly . That is my intent . ’

Even now our lives are not guaranteed with certainty : the storm clouds still terrify my mind . How would you feel now , poor soul , if the fates had willed you to be saved , but not me ? How could you endure your fear alone ? Who would comfort your tears ? Believe me , dear wife , if the sea had you , I would follow you , and the sea would have me too . If only I , by my father ’s arts , could recreate earth ’s peoples , and breathe life into the shaping clay ! The human race remains in us . The gods willed it that we are the only examples of mankind left behind . ’

4294	4305	4266	4266	Themis	1672	’ The goddess was moved , and uttered oracular speech : ‘
4326	4410	4266	4266	Themis	1672	’ For a long time they stand there , dumbfounded . Pyrrha is first to break the silence : she refuses to obey the goddess ’s command . Her lips trembling she asks for pardon , fearing to offend her mother ’s spirit by scattering her bones . Meanwhile they reconsider the dark words the oracle gave , and their uncertain meaning , turning them over and over in their minds . Then Prometheus ’s son comforted Epimetheus ’s daughter with quiet words : ‘
4463	5055	4440	4440	she	1680	’ Though the Titan ’s daughter is stirred by her husband ’s thoughts , still hope is uncertain : they are both so unsure of the divine promptings ; but what harm can it do to try ? They descended the steps , covered their heads and loosened their clothes , and threw the stones needed behind them . The stones , and who would believe it if it were not for ancient tradition , began to lose their rigidity and hardness , and after a while softened , and once softened acquired new form . Then after growing , and ripening in nature , a certain likeness to a human shape could be vaguely seen , like marble statues at first inexact and roughly carved . The earthy part , however , wet with moisture , turned to flesh ; what was solid and inflexible mutated to bone ; the veins stayed veins ; and quickly , through the power of the gods , stones the man threw took on the shapes of men , and women were remade from those thrown by the woman . So the toughness of our race , our ability to endure hard labour , and the proof we give of the source from which we are sprung . Earth spontaneously created other diverse forms of animal life . After the remaining moisture had warmed in the sun ’s fire , the wet mud of the marshlands swelled with heat , and the fertile seeds of things , nourished by life - giving soil as if in a mother ’s womb , grew , and in time acquired a nature . So , when the seven - mouthed Nile retreats from the drowned fields and returns to its former bed , and the fresh mud boils in the sun , farmers find many creatures as they turn the lumps of earth . Amongst them they see some just spawned , on the edge of life , some with incomplete bodies and number of limbs , and often in the same matter one part is alive and the other is raw earth . In fact when heat and moisture are mixed they conceive , and from these two things the whole of life originates . And though fire and water fight each other , heat and moisture create everything , and this discordant union is suitable for growth . So when the earth muddied from the recent flood glowed again heated by the deep heaven - sent light of the sun she produced innumerable species , partly remaking previous forms , partly creating new monsters . Indeed , though she would not have desired to , she then gave birth to you , great Python , covering so great an area of the mountain slopes , a snake not known before , a terror to the new race of men . The archer god , with lethal shafts that he had only used before on fleeing red deer and roe deer , with a thousand arrows , almost emptying his quiver , destroyed the creature , the venom running out from its black wounds . Then he founded the sacred Pythian games , celebrated by contests , named from the serpent he had conquered . There the young winners in boxing , in foot and chariot racing , were honoured with oak wreaths . There was no laurel as yet , so Phoebus crowned his temples , his handsome curling hair , with leaves of any tree .
5102	5184	5096	5096	his	519	‘ Impudent boy , what are you doing with a man ’s weapons ? That one is suited to my shoulders , since I can hit wild beasts of a certainty , and wound my enemies , and not long ago destroyed with countless arrows the swollen Python that covered many acres with its plague - ridden belly . You should be intent on stirring the concealed fires of love with your burning brand , not laying claim to my glories ! ’
5189	5227	5228	5228	He	1685	‘ You may hit every other thing Phoebus , but my bow will strike you : to the degree that all living creatures are less than gods , by that degree is your glory less than mine . ’

Pity me ! I am afraid you might fall headlong or thorns undeservedly scar your legs and I be a cause of grief to you ! These are rough places you run through . Slow down , I ask you , check your flight , and I too will slow . At least enquire whom it is you have charmed . I am no mountain man , no shepherd , no rough guardian of the herds and flocks . Rash girl , you do not know , you can not realise , who you run from , and so you run . Delphi ’s lands are mine , Claros and Tenedos , and Patara acknowledges me king . Jupiter is my father . Through me what was , what is , and what will be , are revealed . Through me strings sound in harmony , to song . My aim is certain , but an arrow truer than mine , has wounded my free heart ! The whole world calls me the bringer of aid ; medicine is my invention ; my power is in herbs . But love can not be healed by any herb , nor can the arts that cure others cure their lord ! ’

Without speech , you do not answer in words to mine , only heave deep sighs from your breast , and all you can do is low in reply to me . Unknowingly I was arranging marriage and a marriage - bed for you , hoping for a son - in - law first and then grandchildren . Now you must find a mate from the herd , and from the herd get you a son . I am not allowed by dying to end such sorrow ; it is hard to be a god , the door of death closed to me , my grief goes on immortal for ever . ’

But she followed the worship of the Ortygian goddess in staying virgin . Her dress caught up like Diana she deceives the eye , and could be mistaken for Leto ’s daughter , except that her bow is of horn , and the other ’s is of gold . Even so she is deceptive . Pan , whose head is crowned with a wreath of sharp pine shoots , saw her , coming from Mount Lycaeus , and spoke to her . ’

It is no great effort for you yourself to find your father ’s house . The place he rises from is near our land . If you have it in mind to do so , go and ask the sun himself ! ’
9419	9444	9445	9445	Phaethon	553	‘ What reason brings you here ? What do you look for on these heights , Phaethon , son that no father need deny ? ’
9447	9502	9503	9503	He	553	‘ Universal light of the great world , Phoebus , father , if you let me use that name , if Clymene is not hiding some fault behind false pretence , give me proof father , so they will believe I am your true offspring , and take away this uncertainty from my mind ! ’
9530	9598	9528	9528	he	1775	‘ It is not to be denied you are worthy to be mine , and Clymene has told you the truth of your birth . So that you can banish doubt , ask for any favour , so that I can grant it to you . May the Stygian lake , that my eyes have never seen , by which the gods swear , witness my promise . ’
9652	9797	9650	9650	he	1775	‘ Your words show mine were rash ; if only it were right to retract my promise ! I confess my boy I would only refuse you this one thing . It is right to dissuade you . What you want is unsafe . Phaethon you ask too great a favour , and one that is unfitting for your strength and boyish years . Your fate is mortal : it is not mortal what you ask . Unknowingly you aspire to more than the gods can share . Though each deity can please themselves , within what is allowed , no one except myself has the power to occupy the chariot of fire . Even the lord of mighty Olympus , who hurls terrifying lightning - bolts from his right hand , can not drive this team , and who is greater than Jupiter ? ’
9798	10136	9650	9650	he	1775	‘ The first part of the track is steep , and one that my fresh horses at dawn can hardly climb . In mid - heaven it is highest , where to look down on earth and sea often alarms even me , and makes my heart tremble with awesome fear . The last part of the track is downwards and needs sure control . Then even Tethys herself , who receives me in her submissive waves , is accustomed to fear that I might dive headlong . Moreover the rushing sky is constantly turning , and drags along the remote stars , and whirls them in rapid orbits . I move the opposite way , and its momentum does not overcome me as it does all other things , and I ride contrary to its swift rotation . Suppose you are given the chariot . What will you do ? Will you be able to counter the turning poles so that the swiftness of the skies does not carry you away ? Perhaps you conceive in imagination that there are groves there and cities of the gods and temples with rich gifts . The way runs through ambush , and apparitions of wild beasts ! Even if you keep your course , and do not steer awry , you must still avoid the horns of Taurus the Bull , Sagittarius the Haemonian Archer , raging Leo and the Lion ’s jaw , Scorpio ’s cruel pincers sweeping out to encircle you from one side , and Cancer ’s crab - claws reaching out from the other . You will not easily rule those proud horses , breathing out through mouth and nostrils the fires burning in their chests . They scarcely tolerate my control when their fierce spirits are hot , and their necks resist the reins . Beware my boy , that I am not the source of a gift fatal to you , while something can still be done to set right your request ! ’
10137	10306	10334	10334	he	553	‘ No doubt , since you ask for a certain sign to give you confidence in being born of my blood , I give you that sure sign by fearing for you , and show myself a father by fatherly anxiety . Look at me . If only you could look into my heart , and see a father ’s concern from within ! Finally , look around you , at the riches the world holds , and ask for anything from all of the good things in earth , sea , and sky . I can refuse you nothing . Only this one thing I take exception to , which would truly be a punishment and not an honour . Phaethon , you ask for punishment as your reward ! Why do you unknowingly throw your coaxing arms around my neck ? Have no doubt ! Whatever you ask will be given , I have sworn it by the Stygian streams , but make a wiser choice ! ’
10572	10907	10552	10552	his	1852	‘ If you can at least obey your father ’s promptings , spare the whip , boy , and rein them in more strongly ! They run swiftly of their own accord . It is a hard task to check their eagerness . And do not please yourself , taking a path straight through the five zones of heaven ! The track runs obliquely in a wide curve , and bounded by the three central regions , avoids the southern pole and the Arctic north . This is your road , you will clearly see my wheel - marks , and so that heaven and earth receive equal warmth , do not sink down too far or heave the chariot into the upper air ! Too high and you will scorch the roof of heaven : too low , the earth . The middle way is safest . Nor must you swerve too far right towards writhing Serpens , nor lead your wheels too far left towards sunken Ara . Hold your way between them ! I leave the rest to Fortune , I pray she helps you , and takes better care of you than you do yourself . While I have been speaking , dewy night has touched her limit on Hesperus ’s far western shore . We have no time for freedom ! We are needed : Aurora , the dawn , shines , and the shadows are gone . Seize the reins in your hand , or if your mind can be changed , take my counsel , do not take my horses ! While you can , while you still stand on solid ground , before unknowingly you take to the chariot you have unluckily chosen , let me light the world , while you watch in safety ! The boy has already taken possession of the fleet chariot , and stands proudly , and joyfully , takes the light reins in his hands , and thanks his unwilling father .
12350	12417	12332	12332	she	1924	‘ If this pleases you , if I have deserved it , O king of the gods , why delay your lightning bolts ? If it is right for me to die through the power of fire , let me die by your fire and let the doer of it lessen the pain of the deed ! I can hardly open my lips to say these words ’
12640	12868	12870	12870	Phaethon	553	’ So the Earth spoke , and unable to tolerate the heat any longer or speak any further , she withdrew her face into her depths closer to the caverns of the dead . But the all - powerful father of the gods climbs to the highest summit of heaven , from where he spreads his clouds over the wide earth , from where he moves the thunder and hurls his quivering lightning bolts , calling on the gods , especially on him who had handed over the sun chariot , to witness that , unless he himself helps , the whole world will be overtaken by a ruinous fate . Now he has no clouds to cover the earth , or rain to shower from the sky . He thundered , and balancing a lightning bolt in his right hand threw it from eye - level at the charioteer , removing him , at the same moment , from the chariot and from life , extinguishing fire with fierce fire . Thrown into confusion the horses , lurching in different directions , wrench their necks from the yoke and throw off the broken harness . Here the reins lie , there the axle torn from the pole , there the spokes of shattered wheels , and the fragments of the wrecked chariot are flung far and wide .
12978	13176	12963	12963	they	1946	’S JOURNEY MADE DARED ALL THOUGH HE BY WEAKNESS WAS BETRAYED Now the father , pitiful , ill with grief , hid his face , and , if we can believe it , a whole day went by without the sun . But the fires gave light , so there was something beneficial amongst all that evil . But Clymene , having uttered whatever can be uttered at such misfortune , grieving and frantic and tearing her breast , wandered over the whole earth first looking for her son ’s limbs , and then failing that his bones . She found his bones already buried however , beside the riverbank in a foreign country . Falling to the ground she bathed with tears the name she could read on the cold stone and warmed it against her naked breast . The Heliads , her daughters and the Sun ’s , cry no less , and offer their empty tribute of tears to the dead , and , beating their breasts with their hands , they call for their brother night and day , and lie down on his tomb , though he can not hear their pitiful sighs .

13682	13800	13680	13680	he	1972	‘ since the beginning , my task has given me no rest and I am weary of work without end and labour without honour ! Whoever chooses to can steer the chariot of light ! If no one does , and all the gods acknowledge they can not , let Jupiter himself do it , so that for a while at least , while he tries to take the reins , he must put aside the lightning bolts that leave fathers bereft ! Then he will know when he has tried the strength of those horses , with hooves of fire , that the one who failed to rule them well did not deserve to be killed . ’

Why should anyone wish to avoid wounding Juno or dread my enmity if I only benefit those I harm ? Oh what a great achievement ! Oh what marvellous powers I have ! I stopped her being human and she becomes a goddess ! This is the punishment I inflict on the guilty ! This is my wonderful sovereignty ! Let him take away her animal form and restore her former beauty as he did before with that Argive girl , Io . Why not divorce Juno , install her in my place , and let Lycaon be his father - in - law ?

You also , dear father , now immortal , and created by the law of your birth to live on through all the ages , will long for death , when you are tormented by the terrible venom of the Serpent , Hydra , absorbed through your wounded limbs .

Soon they seemed neither words nor a horse ’s neighs , but the imitation of a horse . In a little while she gave out clear whinnying noises , and her arms moved in the grass . Then her fingers came together and one thin solid hoof of horn joined her five fingernails . Her head and the length of her neck extended , the greater part of her long gown became a tail , and the loose hair thrown over her neck hung down as a mane on her right shoulder . Now she was altered in both voice and features , and from this marvellous happening she gained a new name . The demi - god , son of Philyra , wept , and called to you for help in vain , O lord of Delphi . You could not re - call mighty Jupiter ’s command , and , if you had been able to , you were not there . You lived in Elis and the Messenian lands . That was the time when you wore a shepherd ’s cloak , carried a wooden crook in your left hand , and in the other a pipe of seven disparate reeds . And while your thoughts were of love , while you played sweetly on your pipe , your cattle , unguarded , strayed , it is said , into the Pylian fields . There , Mercury Atlantiades , son of Maia , saw them and by his arts drove them into the woods and hid them there . Nobody saw the theft except one old man , well known in that country , whom they called Battus . He served as guardian of a herd of pedigree mares , for a wealthy man Neleus , in the rich meadows and woodland pastures . Mercury found him and drawing him away with coaxing hand said ‘
17560	17573	17588	17588	I	0	’ and he handed it over . The fellow accepted it and replied ‘
17589	17615	17616	17616	Countryman	2111	’ and he even pointed out a stone . Jupiter ’s son pretended to go , but soon returned in another form and voice , saying ‘
17654	17664	17641	17641	I	0	’ The old man , hearing the prize doubled said ‘
17686	17690	17692	17692	you	2111	’ Atlantiades laughed . ‘
17706	17722	17692	17692	you	2111	’ And he turned that deceitful body to solid flint , that even now is called ‘
17724	17727	17692	17692	you	2111	’ , the ‘
17729	17740	17692	17692	you	2111	’ , and unjustly the old disgrace clings to the stone .
18135	18195	18196	18196	Aglauros	624	‘ I am the one who carries my father ’s messages through the air . My father is Jupiter himself . I wo n’t hide the reason . Only be loyal to your sister and consent to be called my child ’s aunt . Herse is the reason I am here . I beg you to help a lover . ’
18442	18600	18401	18401	she	2157	’ meat that fed her venom , and at the sight the goddess averted her eyes . But the other got up slowly from the ground , leaving the half - eaten snake flesh , and came forward with sluggish steps . When she saw the goddess dressed in her armour and her beauty , she moaned and frowned as she sighed . Pallor spreads over her face , and all her body shrivels . Her sight is skewed , her teeth are livid with decay , her breast is green with bile , and her tongue is suffused with venom . She only smiles at the sight of suffering . She never sleeps , excited by watchful cares . She finds men ’s successes disagreeable , and pines away at the sight . She gnaws and being gnawed is also her own punishment . Though she hated her so , nevertheless Tritonia spoke briefly to her . ‘
18621	18889	18618	18619	the one	1688	’ Without more words she fled and with a thrust of her spear sprang from the earth . Envy , squinting at her as she flees , gives out low mutterings , sorry to think of Minerva ’s coming success . She takes her staff bound with strands of briar , and sets out , shrouded in gloomy clouds . Wherever she passes she tramples the flower - filled fields , withers the grass , blasts the highest treetops and poisons homes , cities and peoples with her breath . At last she sees Athens , Tritonia ’s city , flourishing with arts and riches and leisured peace . She can hardly hold back her tears because she sees nothing tearful . But after entering the chamber of Cecrops ’s daughter , she carried out her command and touched her breast with a hand tinted with darkness and filled her heart with sharp thorns . Then she breathed poisonous , destructive breath into her and spread black venom through her bones and the inside of her lungs . And so that the cause for pain might never be far away she placed Aglauros ’s sister before her eyes , in imagination , her sister ’s fortunate marriage , and the beauty of the god , magnifying it all . Cecrops ’s daughter , tormented by this , is eaten by secret agony , and troubled by night and troubled by light , she moans and wastes away in slow , wretched decay , like ice eroded by the fitful sun . She is consumed by envy of Herses ’

But while the instruments of cruelty , the irons and the fire , were being prepared to kill him as had been ordered , the doors flew open by themselves , the chains loosening without any effort , so tradition holds . The son of Echion persisted in his purpose , not ordering others to go , but now going himself , to where Mount Cithaeron , chosen for performing the rites , was sounding with the chants and shrill cries of the Bacchantes . As a brave horse snorts and shows his love for the fight , when the trumpeter ’s brass gives the signal for attack , so the heavens pulsating from the long drawn - out cries stirred Pentheus , and , hearing the clamour , his anger flared again . Near the middle of the mountainside , was a clearing surrounded with remote woods , free of trees , and visible from all sides . Here as he watched the mysteries , with profane eyes , his mother was the first to see Pentheus , the first roused to run at him madly , the first to wound him , hurling her thyrsus . She shouted ‘

Warned by such an example , the Theban women throng to the new religion , burn incense , and worship at the sacred altars . But Alcithoë , daughter of Minyas , will not celebrate the Bacchic rites , in acceptance of the god . She is rash enough to deny that Bacchus is the son of Jupiter , and her sisters share in her impiety . The priest had ordered the observation of the festival , asking for all female servants to be released from work , they and their mistresses to drape animal skins across their breasts , free their headbands , wreathe their hair , and carry an ivy - twined thyrsus in their hand . And he prophesied that the god ’s rage would be fierce if he was angered . The young women and mothers obey , leaving their baskets and looms , and their unfinished tasks , and burn incense , calling on Bacchus , on Bromius , ‘

Or how a Naiad , with incantations , and all too powerful herbs , changed the bodies of youths into dumb fishes , until the same thing happened to her .

He was the first god they say to see the adulteries of Venus and Mars : he sees all things first . He was sorry to witness the act , and he told her husband Vulcan , son of Juno , of this bedroom intrigue , and where the intrigue took place . Vulcan ’s heart dropped , and he dropped in turn the craftsman ’s work he held in his hand . Immediately he began to file thin links of bronze , for a net , a snare that would deceive the eye . The finest spun threads , those the spider spins from the rafters , would not better his work . He made it so it would cling to the smallest movement , the lightest touch , and then artfully placed it over the bed . When the wife and the adulterer had come together on the one couch , they were entangled together , surprised in the midst of their embraces , by the husband ’s craft , and the new method of imprisonment he had prepared for them .

32164	32608	32609	32609	She	2624	’ Clytie was jealous ( there were no bounds to her love for Sol ) , and goaded by anger at her rival , she broadcast the adultery , and maligning the girl , betrayed her to her father . He in his pride and savagery , buried her deep in the earth , she praying , stretching her hands out towards Sol ’s light , crying “ He forced me , against my will ” , and he piled a heavy mound of sand over her . Poor nymph , Hyperion ’s son dispersed this with shafts of light , and gave you a way to show your buried face , but you could not lift your head , crushed by the weight of earth , and lay there , a pale corpse . They say the god of the winged horses had seen nothing more bitter than this , since Phaethon ’s fiery death . He tried to see if he could recall life to those frozen limbs , with his powerful rays . But since fate opposed such efforts , he sprinkled the earth , and the body itself , with fragrant nectar , and , after much lamenting , said “ You will still touch the air ” . Immediately the body , soaked through with heavenly nectar , dissolved , steeping the earth in its perfume . Tentatively , putting out roots , the shoot of a tree , resinous with incense , grew through the soil , and pierced the summit of the mound . The god of light no longer visited Clytie , nor found anything to love in her , even though love might have been an excuse for her pain , and her pain for her betrayal . She wasted away , deranged by her experience of love . Impatient of the nymphs , night and day , under the open sky , she sat dishevelled , bareheaded , on the bare earth . Without food or water , fasting , for nine days , she lived only on dew and tears , and did not stir from the ground . She only gazed at the god ’s aspect as he passed , and turned her face towards him . They say that her limbs clung to the soil , and that her ghastly pallor changed part of her appearance to that of a bloodless plant : but part was reddened , and a flower like a violet hid her face . She turns , always , towards the sun , though her roots hold her fast , and , altered , loves unaltered . ’
32675	33191	32673	32673	she	2624	‘ I will say nothing of that well - known story , the love of Daphnis , the Idaean shepherd - boy , whom a nymph , angered by a rival , turned to stone : so great is the pain that inflames lovers . Neither will I tell you how , the laws of nature conspiring to alter , Sithon became of indeterminate sex , now man , now woman : how Celmis , you too , now changed to steel , were a most loyal friend to the infant Jupiter : how the Curetes were born from vast showers of rain : how Crocus and Smilax were turned into tiny flowers . I will reject all those , and charm your imaginations with a sweet , new story . Now you will hear where the pool of Salmacis got its bad reputation from , how its enervating waters weaken , and soften the limbs they touch . The cause is hidden , but the fountain ’s effect is widely known . The Naiads nursed a child born of Hermes , and a goddess , Cytherean Aphrodite , in Mount Ida ’s caves . His features were such that , in them , both mother and father could be seen : and from them he took his name , Hermaphroditus . When he was fifteen years old , he left his native mountains and Ida , his nursery , delighted to wander in unknown lands , and gaze at unknown rivers , his enthusiasm making light of travel . He even reached the Lycian cities , and the Carians by Lycia . Here he saw a pool of water , clear to its very depths . There were no marsh reeds round it , no sterile sedge , no spikes of rushes : it is crystal liquid . The edges of the pool are bordered by fresh turf , and the grass is always green . A nymph lives there , but she is not skilled for the chase , or used to flexing the bow , or the effort of running , the only Naiad not known by swift - footed Diana . Often , it ’s said , her sisters would tell her “ Salmacis , take up the hunting - spear or the painted quiver and vary your idleness with some hard work , hunting ! ” But she takes up neither the hunting spear nor the painted quiver , and will not vary her idleness with the hardship of hunting . She only bathes her shapely limbs in the pool , often combs out her hair , with a comb that is made of boxwood from Cytorus , and looks in the water to see what suits it best . Then draped in a translucent robe , she lies down on the soft leaves , or in the soft grass . Often she gathers flowers . And she was also busy gathering them , then , when she saw the boy , and what she saw she longed to have . ’
33192	33732	32673	32673	she	2624	‘ She did not go near him yet , though she was quick to go to him , waiting until she had calmed herself , checked her appearance , composed her expression , and merited being seen as beautiful . Then she began to say “ Youth , O most worthy to be thought a god , if you are a god , you must be Cupid , or , if you are mortal , whoever engendered you is blessed , and any brother of yours is happy , any sister fortunate , if you have sisters , and even the nurse who suckled you at her breast . But far beyond them , and far more blessed is she , if there is a she , promised to you , whom you think worthy of marriage . If there is someone , let mine be a stolen pleasure , if not , I will be the one , and let us enter into marriage together . ” After this the naiad was silent . A red flush branded the boy ’s face . He did not know what love was : though the blush was very becoming . Apples are tinged with this colour , hanging in a sunlit tree , or ivory painted with red , or the moon , eclipsed , blushing in her brightness , while the bronze shields clash , in vain , to rescue her . The nymph begged endlessly , at least a sister ’s kiss , and , about to throw her arms round his ivory - white neck , he said “ Stop this , or shall I go , and leave this place , and you ? ” Salmacis , afraid , turning away , pretended to go , saying , “ I freely surrender this place to you , be my guest . ” But she still looked back , and hid herself among bushes in the secluded woods , on her bended knees . But he , obviously at leisure , as if unobserved , walks here and there on the grass and playfully , at the end of his walk , dips his feet and ankles in the pool . Then , quickly captured by the coolness of the enticing water , he stripped the soft clothes from his slender body . Then she was truly pleased . And Salmacis was inflamed with desire for his naked form . The nymph ’s eyes blazed with passion , as when Phoebus ’s likeness is reflected from a mirror , that opposes his brightest unclouded orb . She can scarcely wait , scarcely contain her delight , now longing to hold him , now unable to keep her love to herself . He , clapping his open palms to his side , dives into the pool , and leading with one arm and then the other , he gleams through the pure water , as if one sheathed an ivory statue , or bright lilies behind clear glass . “ I have won , he is mine ” , the naiad cries , and flinging aside all her garments , she throws herself into the midst of the water .
34135	34309	34110	34111	his parents	2650	’ The story was finished , and the daughters of Minyas still pressed on with their work , spurning the god and profaning his festival , when suddenly harsh sounds sprang up from unseen drums , pipes with curved horns sounded , and cymbals clashed . Saffron and myrrh perfumed the air , and unbelievably their looms began to grow like greenwood , the cloth they were weaving put out leaves of hanging ivy , part altered to vines , and what were once threads changed into tendrils : vine shoots came out of the warp , and clusters of dark - coloured grapes took on the splendour of the purple fabric . Now the day was past , and the time had come when you could not say that it was light or darkness , but a borderland of light and uncertain night . Suddenly the ceiling shook , the oil lamps seemed to brighten , and the house to shine with glowing fires , and fill with the howling of fierce creatures ’

Can Juno do nothing except lament her troubles , un - avenged ? Is that enough for me ? Is that my only power ? He teaches me what to do ( it is possible to learn from the enemy ): he has shown enough , and more than enough , of the power madness has , by the killing of Pentheus . Why should Ino not be tormented , and follow her relatives ’
34664	35087	34530	34530	She	525	’ There is a downward path , gloomy with fatal yew trees : it leads through dumb silence to the infernal regions . The sluggish Styx exhales vapour , and , by that way , the shadows of the newly dead descend , entombed with full rites , and the ghosts of those , at last , given proper burial . The wide , thorny waste is cold and pallid , and the newly arrived shades are ignorant of the road that leads to the Stygian city , where black Dis has his cruel palace . The roomy city has a thousand entrances , and open gates on every side , and as the ocean accepts the rivers of all the world , so this place accepts all the souls , and is never too small for any populace , nor notices the crowds that come . There the bloodless shadows wander without flesh or bone . Some crowd the forum , some the house of the ruler of the depths , others follow their trades , imitating their previous lives , and still others incur punishment . Leaving her place in heaven , Saturnian Juno endured the journey there , giving in to such a degree to anger and hatred . As soon as she entered and the threshold sighed at the touch of her sacred body , Cerberus lifted his triple head and let out his threefold baying . She called out for the dread , implacable Furies , the Sisters , the children of Night . They sat in front of the prison gates , closed with steel , combing out their hair , of black snakes . The goddesses rose together , recognising her shadow in the darkness . The place is called Accursed . Here Tityos offers up his innards to be torn , stretched out over nine fields . You , Tantalus , can not catch the drops of water , and the tree you grasp at , eludes you . You , Sisyphus , attack or pursue the stone that always returns . Ixion turns , and follows after himself and flees , and the forty - nine Belides , who dared to plot the destruction of their cousins , their husbands , fetch again , with incessant labour , the water they have lost . After Saturnia had looked grimly , glancing fiercely , at all these , and at Ixion above all , looking back from him to Sisyphus , she asks the Furies ‘
35124	35211	35225	35225	you	2669	’ And she expounds the causes of her hatred , her journey , and what it is she wishes . What she wished was that the House of Cadmus should no longer stand , and that the Sisters should drive Athamas mad . She urged the goddesses help , mingling promises , commands and prayers together . When Juno had finished speaking , Tisiphone , grey - haired as she was , shook her locks , flinging back the snakes that concealed her face , and said ‘
35244	35673	35674	35674	Friends	6150	’ Juno returned happily , and Iris , her messenger , the daughter of Thaumus , purified her , as she was about to enter heaven , with drops of dew . Without delay , Tisiphone , the troubler , grasped a torch soaked with blood , put on a dripping red robe , coiled a writhing serpent round her waist , and left the spot . Grief went as her companion , and Panic , and Terror , and Madness with agitated face . She took up her position on the threshold , and they say the pillars of the doorway of Aeolus ’s palace shook , the doors of maple - wood were tainted with whiteness , and the sun fled the place . Athamas and his wife , Ino , were terrified at these portents of doom , and they tried to escape the palace . The baleful Erinys obstructed them , and blocked the way . Stretching out her arms , wreathed with knots of vipers , she flailed her hair , and the snakes hissed at her movements . Some coiled over her shoulders , some slid over her breast , giving out whistling noises , vomiting blood , and flickering their tongues . Then she pulls two serpents from the midst of her hair , and hurls what she has snatched with a deadly aim . They slither over Ino and Athamas , and blow their oppressive breath into them . Their limbs are not wounded : it is the mind that feels the dreadful stroke . She had brought foul poisonous liquids too , spume from the jaws of Cerberus , Echidna ’s venom , those that cause vague delusions , dark oblivions of the mind , wickedness and weeping , rage and love of murder , all seethed together . She had boiled them , mixed with fresh blood , in hollow bronze , stirred with a stalk of green hemlock . While they stood trembling , she poured this venom of the Furies over the breasts of the two of them , and sent it into the depths of their minds . Then , brandishing her torch , encircled them with fire , by fire ’s swift movement , whirling it round in repeated orbit . So having conquered them , and carried out her orders , she returned to the wide kingdom of mighty Dis , and unloosed the serpent she had wrapped around her . Then Athamas , raving through the centre of his palace , cries out ‘
35695	35820	35821	35821	Euhoe	772	’ and in his madness he followed his wife ’s steps as if she were a wild beast . Then he snatched his son Learchus , who was laughing and waving his little arms , from his mother ’s protection , and whirled him round , two or three times , in the air , in the manner of a sling , and dashed the infant ’s head fiercely against the solid rock . Then the mother , roused at last by the pain this caused , or by reason of the poison sprinkled on her , howled like an animal , and fled , insanely , tearing at her hair . In her naked arms she carried you , Melicertes , and cried out ‘
35824	35835	35823	35823	Bacchus	682	’ . Juno laughed aloud at Bacchus ’s name , saying ‘
35848	35941	35823	35823	Bacchus	682	’ A cliff overhung the water , carved out at its base by the breakers , and it sheltered the waves it hid , from the rain . Its summit reared up and stretched out , in front , over the water , into empty space . Ino climbed up there ( madness had lent her strength ) and unrestrained by fear threw herself and her burden into the sea : the wave foamed white where she fell . Venus , pitying her granddaughter ’s undeserved sufferings , coaxed her uncle , saying ‘
36027	36031	36032	36032	Aphrodite	753	‘ foam - born ’
36036	36166	36167	36167	I	0	’ Neptune accepted her prayer , and taking from them what was mortal , gave them greatness , giving them at the same time new names and forms , calling the god Palaemon , and his mother , Leucothoë , the white goddess . Ino ’s Sidonian attendants followed the marks of her feet as best they could , only to see her last leap from the pinnacle of rock . Not doubting that she was dead , they mourned for the House of Cadmus , beating their breasts , tearing at their clothes and hair , saying that the goddess had shown too little justice , and too much cruelty , to the rival who had made her jealous . Juno could not bear their protests , and said ‘
36177	36194	36195	36195	I	0	’ . What she said was done . Now the one who had been most faithful cried ‘
36203	36443	36195	36195	I	0	’ , and starting her leap could not move at all , and stuck fast , fixed to the cliff . Another felt her raised arms grow rigid , when she tried to beat her breasts , as she had been doing . Another chanced to stretch her hands out to the waves of the sea , but now hands made of stone were extended over the same waves . One , as she tore at the crown of her head to pull out her hair , you might see , suddenly with stiffened fingers amongst her hair . Whatever gesture they were caught in , there they remained . Others , Theban women , changed to birds , also , now , skim the surface of those depths with their wings . The son of Agenor , Cadmus , did not know that his daughter and little grandson were now sea - gods . Conquered by the pain of this run of disasters , and daunted by all he had seen , the founder departed his city , as if the misfortunes of the place and not himself were oppressing him . Driven to wandering , at length his journey carried him and his wife to the borders of Illyria . Now , weighed down by age and sadness , they thought of the original destiny of their house , and in talk reviewed their sufferings . Cadmus said ‘
36503	36590	36492	36492	I	0	’ And , so speaking , he did extend into a long - bellied snake , and felt his skin hardening as scales grew there , while dark green patches chequered his black body . He lay prone on his breast , and gradually his legs fused together thinning out towards a smooth point . Still his arms were left to him , and what was left of his arms he stretched out , and , with tears running down his still human cheeks , he said ‘
36639	36701	36702	36702	Cadmus	634	’ He wanted to say so much more , but suddenly his tongue was split in two , and though he wished for words none came , and whenever he started on some plaintive sound , he hissed : this was the voice that Nature bequeathed him . Then , striking her naked breast with her hands , his wife cried out ‘
36762	37293	37294	37294	Friend	5789	’ She spoke . His tongue flickered over his wife ’s face , he slid between her beloved breasts as if known there , and clasped her , and searched about for the neck he knew so well . Everyone who was there ( their comrades were present ) was horrified , but she stroked the gleaming neck of the crested serpent , and suddenly there were two snakes there , with intertwining coils , until they sought the shelter of the neighbouring woods . Even now they do not avoid human beings or wound them , quiet serpents , remembering what they once were . Nevertheless even in their altered form , their grandson Bacchus gave them great consolation , whom conquered India worshipped , to whose newly created temples the Achaians thronged . Only Acrisius , son of Abas , born from the same roots ( through Belus brother of Agenor ) , was an exception , who closed Argos within its walls , took up arms against the god , and did not consider him a child of Jupiter . Nor did he consider , as a child of Jupiter , his grandson Perseus whom Danaë conceived of a shower of gold . Though later ( such is truth ’s power ) Acrisius repented of outraging the god , and of not acknowledging his grandson . One had taken his place in the heavens , but the other was travelling through the gentle air , on beating wings , bringing back an amazing , monstrous prize , and as the victor hung above the Libyan sands , bloody drops fell from the Gorgon ’s head . The earth caught them and gave them life , as species of snakes , and so that country is infested with deadly serpents . He was driven from there by conflicting winds , carried this way and that , through vast spaces , like a rain cloud . He flew over the whole world , looking down , through the air , from a great height at remote countries . Three times he saw the frozen constellations of the Bears , three times the Crab ’s pincers . Often he was forced below the west , often into the east , and now as the light died , afraid to trust to night , he put down in the western regions of Hesperus , in the kingdom of Atlas . He looked to rest there a while , till Lucifer summoned up Aurora ’s fires , and Aurora the chariot of dawn . Here was Atlas , son of Iapetus , exceeding all men by the size of his body . The most remote land was under Atlas ’s rule , and the ocean , into which Sol ’s panting horses plunged , and where his straining axle was welcomed . He had a thousand flocks , and as many herds of cattle straying through the grass , and no neighbouring soil was richer than his . The leaves of the trees , bright with radiant gold , covered branches of gold , and fruit of gold . Perseus said to him ‘
37328	37343	37344	37344	Atlas	546	’ Atlas remembered an ancient prophecy . Themis on Parnassus had given that prophecy . ‘
37373	37410	37368	37371	the son of Jupiter	6250	’ Fearful of this , Atlas had enclosed his orchard with solid walls , and set a huge dragon to guard it , and kept all strangers away from his borders . To Perseus , he said ‘
37434	37480	37485	37485	you	546	’ He added weight to his threats , and tried to push him away with his great hands , Perseus delaying resolutely , and combining that with calm words . Inferior in strength ( who could equal Atlas in strength ? ) , he said , ‘
37495	37800	37485	37485	you	546	’ and turning away himself , he held out Medusa ’s foul head , on his left hand side . Atlas became a mountain , as huge as he himself had been . Now his hair and beard were changed into trees , his shoulders and hands into ridges . What had been his head before was the crest on the mountain summit . His bones became stones . Then he grew to an immense height in every part ( so you gods determined ) and the whole sky , with its many stars , rested on him . Aeolus , son of Hippotas , had confined the winds in their prison under Mount Etna , and Lucifer , who exhorts us to work , shone brightest of all in the depths of the eastern sky . Perseus strapped the winged sandals he had put to one side to his feet , armed himself with his curved sword , and cut through the clear air on beating pinions . Leaving innumerable nations behind , below and around him , he came in sight of the Ethiopian peoples , and the fields of Cepheus . There Jupiter Ammon had unjustly ordered the innocent Andromeda to pay the penalty for her mother Cassiopeia ’s words . As soon as Perseus , great - grandson of Abas , saw her fastened by her arms to the hard rock , he would have thought she was a marble statue , except that a light breeze stirred her hair , and warm tears ran from her eyes . He took fire without knowing it and was stunned , and seized by the vision of the form he saw , he almost forgot to flicker his wings in the air . As soon as he had touched down , he said ‘
38022	38152	38019	38020	the stranger	2710	‘ There will be plenty of time left for tears , but only a brief hour is given us to work . If I asked for this girl as Perseus , son of Jupiter and that Danaë , imprisoned in the brazen tower , whom Jupiter filled with his rich golden shower ; Perseus conqueror of the Gorgon with snakes for hair , he who dared to fly , driven through the air , on soaring wings , then surely I should be preferred to all other suitors as a son - in - law . If the gods favour me , I will try to add further merit to these great gifts . I will make a bargain . Rescued by my courage , she must be mine . ’
38265	38980	38981	38981	Perseus	776	’ surface , the creature raged against the shadow it had seen . As Jupiter ’s eagle , when it sees a snake , in an open field , showing its livid body to the sun , takes it from behind , and fixes its eager talons in the scaly neck , lest it twists back its cruel fangs , so the descendant of Inachus hurling himself headlong , in swift flight , through empty space , attacked the creature ’s back , and , as it roared , buried his sword , to the end of the curved blade , in the right side of its neck . Hurt by the deep wound , now it reared high in the air , now it dived underwater , or turned now , like a fierce wild boar , when the dogs scare him , and the pack is baying around him . Perseus evades the eager jaws on swift wings , and strikes with his curved sword wherever the monster is exposed , now at the back encrusted with barnacles , now at the sides of the body , now where the tail is slenderest , ending fishlike . The beast vomits seawater mixed with purplish blood . The pinions grow heavy , soaked with spray . Not daring to trust his drenched wings any further , he sees a rock whose highest point stands above quiet water , hidden by rough seas . Resting there , and holding on to the topmost pinnacle with his left hand , he drives his sword in three or four times , repeatedly . The shores , and the high places of the gods , fill with the clamour of applause . Cassiope and Cepheus rejoice , and greet their son - in - law , acknowledging him as the pillar of their house , and their deliverer . Released from her chains , the girl comes forward , the prize and the cause of his efforts . He washes his hands after the victory in seawater drawn for him , and , so that Medusa ’s head , covered with its snakes , is not bruised by the harsh sand , he makes the ground soft with leaves , and spreads out plants from below the waves , and places the head of that daughter of Phorcys on them . The fresh plants , still living inside , and absorbent , respond to the influence of the Gorgon ’s head , and harden at its touch , acquiring a new rigidity in branches and fronds . And the ocean nymphs try out this wonder on more plants , and are delighted that the same thing happens at its touch , and repeat it by scattering the seeds from the plants through the waves . Even now corals have the same nature , hardening at a touch of air , and what was alive , under the water , above water is turned to stone . To the three gods , he builds the same number of altars out of turf , to you Mercury on the left , to you Minerva , warlike virgin , on the right , and an altar of Jupiter in the centre . He sacrifices a cow to Minerva , a calf to the wing - footed god , and a bull to you , greatest of the gods . Then he claims Andromeda , without a dowry , valuing her as the worthiest prize . Hymen and Amor wave the marriage torch , the fires are saturated with strong perfumes , garlands hang from the rafters , and everywhere flutes and pipes , and singing , sound out , the happy evidence of joyful hearts . The doors fold back to show the whole of the golden hall , and the noble Ethiopian princes enter to a richly prepared banquet already set out for them . When they have attacked the feast , and their spirits are cheered by wine , the generous gift of Bacchus , Perseus asks about the country and its culture , its customs and the character of its people . At the same time as he instructed him about these , one of the guests said ‘
39006	39280	38985	38985	you	776	’ The descendant of Agenor told how there was a cave lying below the frozen slopes of Atlas , safely hidden in its solid mass . At the entrance to this place the sisters lived , the Graeae , daughters of Phorcys , similar in appearance , sharing only one eye between them . He removed it , cleverly , and stealthily , cunningly substituting his own hand while they were passing it from one to another . Far from there , by hidden tracks , and through rocks bristling with shaggy trees , he reached the place where the Gorgons lived . In the fields and along the paths , here and there , he saw the shapes of men and animals changed from their natures to hard stone by Medusa ’s gaze . Nevertheless he had himself looked at the dread form of Medusa reflected in a circular shield of polished bronze that he carried on his left arm . And while a deep sleep held the snakes and herself , he struck her head from her neck . And the swift winged horse Pegasus and his brother the warrior Chrysaor , were born from their mother ’s blood . He told of his long journeys , of dangers that were not imaginary ones , what seas and lands he had seen below from his high flight , and what stars he had brushed against with beating wings . He still finished speaking before they wished . Next one of the many princes asked why Medusa , alone among her sisters , had snakes twining in her hair . The guest replied ‘
39412	39522	39405	39405	she	2727	’ While the hero , the son of Danae , is recalling this succession of events , amongst the Ethiopians , the royal halls suddenly fill with a riot of complaints . It is not the sound of a wedding feast that rings out , but that which presages the use of arms . The festivities , turned to sudden confusion , could be likened to a calm sea that the fierce raging of the wind churns into rising waves . Phineus , the king ’s brother , is first mover in this , a rash stirrer - up of strife , shaking his ashen spear tipped with bronze . ‘
39525	39528	39405	39405	she	2727	’ he shouted ‘
39567	39578	39581	39581	you	2733	’ As he prepared to throw the spear , Cepheus cried ‘
39831	40266	40269	40269	yourself	2742	’ Phineus said nothing , but turned his face alternately from Perseus to his brother , not knowing whether to aim at the one or the other . Hesitating for a while he hurled his spear , throwing it with the energy of anger , but uselessly , at Perseus . Only when it had stuck fast in the bench , did Perseus leap up from where he was lying . Returning the weapon , fiercely , he would have pierced his enemy ’s chest , if Phineus had not dodged behind the altars : and ( shamefully ) the wretch found safety in that refuge . Nevertheless the javelin was not without effect , and struck Rhoetus full face , who immediately fell , and , when the weapon had been pulled out of the bone , he kicked out and sprayed the laden tables with his blood . Then the crowd of men was truly ablaze with anger , and they hurled their spears , and there were those who said Cepheus deserved to die with his son - in - law . But Cepheus had already crossed the threshold , calling on justice , good faith , and on the gods of friendship , to witness that what was being done was forbidden . Warlike Pallas came and protected her brother , Perseus , with her shield , the aegis , and gave him courage . There was a youth from India , Athis , whom Limnaee , a nymph of the River Ganges is said to have given birth to , under its glassy waters . He was of outstanding beauty , his sixteen years unimpaired , enhanced by his rich robes , wearing his military cloak of Tyrian purple , fringed with gold . A gold collar ornamented his neck , and a curved coronet his myrrh - drenched hair . He was skilled at piercing anything with the javelins he launched , however distant , but was even more skilled at shooting with the bow . While he was bending the pliant tips in his hands , Perseus struck him , with a log that had been smouldering in the middle of the altar , and shattered his face to splintered bone . When Lycabas , the Assyrian , closest to him , as a friend , and , most probably , a lover , saw his much praised features masked with blood , he wept bitterly for Athis , breathing out his life through that sad wound . He caught up the bow Athis had strung and said ‘
40296	40625	40273	40273	You	2742	’ He had not finished speaking when the sharp arrow shot from the bowstring , but Perseus avoided it , and it was left hanging from a fold of his clothes . The grandson of Acrisius turned against him that scimitar , tried and proven in his killing of Medusa , driving it into his chest . But even in death , his eyes failing , he looked round for Athis , in that gloomy night , and fell next to him , taking for his solace , to the shadows , the fact of being joined with him in death . Phorbas of Syene , the son of Metion , and Libyan Amphimedon , eager to commit to the fight , fell , having slipped on the ground , warm and drenched with blood on every side . Rising , they were stopped by the sword , piercing Phorbas ’s throat , and Amphimedon ’s ribs . But Perseus did not challenge Eurytus , son of Actor , who had a battle - axe , with his scimitar , instead , lifting a mixing bowl , embossed with decorations and very heavy in weight , high in the air , with both hands , he dashed it down on the man , who vomited bright red blood , and , lying on his back , beat the earth with his head . Then Perseus overthrew Polydegmon , born of the blood of Queen Semiramis , Abaris from Caucasia , Lycetus from the River Spercheos region , Helices with flowing hair , Clytus and Phlegyas , and trod on a mounting pile of the dying . Phineus did not dare to fight hand to hand with his enemy , but threw his spear , which felled Idas , by mistake , who , though unavailingly , had no part in the fight , and was a follower of neither side . He , looking fiercely at Phineus , said ‘
40653	40902	40637	40637	Phineus	791	’ He was about to hurl back the javelin he had pulled from his body when he collapsed dying , his limbs drained of blood . Then Hodites , the greatest of the Ethiopians next to the king , was killed by Clymenus ’s sword . Hypseus struck Prothoënor , and Lyncides struck Hypseus . One very old man , Emathion , was there who upheld justice , and feared the gods . He stepped forward , and since his age prevented him fighting , he warred in words , cursing their sinful weapons . Chromis decapitated him with his sword , as he clung to the altar with trembling hands , and the head fell straight on to the hearth , and there the half living tongue still uttered imprecations , and its life expired in the midst of the flames . Then two brothers fell at the hands of Phineus . They were Broteas , and Ammon the famous boxers , who would have been able to overcome anything , if boxing gloves were able to overcome swords , and Ampycus , priest of Ceres , his forehead wreathed with white fillets . And you Lampetides , summoned , but not for this purpose , who played the lute and sang the work of peace , ordered to help celebrate the feast , and recite the bridal songs . Pedasus , mockingly shouted to him , as he stood to one side holding his unwarlike plectrum , ‘
40913	41170	40637	40637	Phineus	791	’ and pierced his left temple with his blade . He fell , and tried to pluck the lyric strings again , with dying fingers , and , falling , struck a plaintive note . Lycormas , angered , did not allow him to die without taking revenge . Grasping a heavy bar from the door on his right , he struck Pedasus , in the middle of his neck - bones , and he fell dead to the ground , like a bullock at the sacrifice . Pelates , from the banks of Cinyps , tried to take the bar from the left door , and , while attempting to do so , his right hand was transfixed by the spear of Corythus , from Marmarica , and pinned to the wood . Abas pierced him in the side as he was fastened there , and he did not fall , but hung there , dying , from the post to which his hand was nailed . Melaneus , a follower of Perseus ’s cause , was also killed , and Dorylas , the wealthiest man in the fields of Nasamonia , Dorylas whose wealth was in fields , than whom no man held a greater tract , nor could pile up as many heaps of spices . A missile thrown from the side stuck in his groin , that fatal place . When Halcyoneus of Bactria , the perpetrator of the wound , saw him gasping for life , his eyes rolling , he said ‘
41185	41727	40637	40637	Phineus	791	’ and left his bloodless corpse . But Perseus , the avenger , the descendant of Abas , turned against him the spear , pulled hot from the wound . Catching the nose , it went through the middle of the neck , jutting out front and back . While Fortune aided his hand , Perseus killed Clytius and Clanis , born of one mother , with different wounds . An ashen spear , from his strong arm , went through both Clytius ’s thighs , while Clanis ’s jaw bit on a javelin . Mendesian Celadon was killed , Astreus , of unknown father and Syrian mother , Aethion , once skilled in telling the future , now deceived by lack of foresight , Thoactes , the armour - bearer of the king , and Agyrtes , notorious for murdering his own father . There is yet more to be done , despite what he has endured : the purpose of all is to overwhelm this one man . The bands of conspirators oppose him on all sides , in a cause opposed to justice , and good faith . His father , with helpless loyalty , and his new bride and her mother , support him to the best of their abilities , filling the palace with their cries . But the clash of weapons and the groans of the fallen , drown them out , and at the same time Bellona , goddess of war , pollutes and drenches the penates , the household gods , with blood , and stirs renewed conflict . Phineus and a thousand followers of Phineus , surround the one man . Spears to the right of him , spears to the left of him , fly thicker than winter hail , past his eyes and ears . He sets his back and shoulders against a massive stone column , and protected behind , turns towards the opposing crowd of men , and withstands their threat . The Chaonian , Molpeus , presses him on the left , and on the right Ethemon , a Nabatean . Like a tiger , goaded by hunger , that hears the bellowing of two herds of cattle in separate valleys , and does not know which it would rather rush at , fired up to rush at either , so Perseus hesitates whether to strike right or left . He drives Molpeus off , piercing him with a wound to the leg , and is content to let him go : but Ethemon allows him no time , and raging and eager to give him a wound high on the neck , flails at him , incautiously and violently , and fractures his sword , striking it on the extreme edge of the column . The blade is detached , and fixes itself in its owner ’s throat . The wound it gives him is not serious enough to cause his death , but as he stands there , quivering , and uselessly stretching out his defenceless arms , Perseus stabs him with Cyllenian Mercury ’s curved sword . When Perseus saw indeed that , his efforts would succumb to the weight of numbers , he said ‘
41755	41765	41751	41751	your	2747	’ and he held up the Gorgon ’s head . ‘
41776	41872	41873	41873	Perseus	776	’ said Thesculus , but as he prepared to throw his deadly javelin , he was frozen , like a marble statue , in the act . Ampyx , next to him , thrust his sword straight at the heart of the courageous descendant of Lynceus , and , in thrusting , his right hand stiffened , without movement this way or that . But Nileus who falsely claimed that he was born of the Nile with its seven mouths , his shield engraved with its seven streams , part gold , part silver , cried ‘
41914	41956	41965	41966	the Gorgon	778	’ . The last echo of his voice was cut off in mid - flight , and you might believe his mouth still wished to speak , though it was no longer pervious to words . Eryx rebuked them , saying , ‘
41987	42226	42227	42227	Perseus	776	’ He had started his rush , but the floor held his feet fast , and there he stayed , unmoving stone , a fully - armed statue . They all deserved the punishment they suffered , except one of Perseus ’s warriors . While he was fighting on his side , Aconteus , saw the Gorgon ’s head , and took the shape of hardened stone . Astyages struck him with his long sword thinking he was still alive , and the blade gave a high - pitched ringing noise . While Astyages stood there amazed , the same power transformed him , and he remained there with a wondering look on his marble face . It would take a long time to tell the names of the middle ranks of men : two hundred bodies survived the fight , two hundred bodies were turned to stone , at sight of the Gorgon ’s head . Now , at last , Phineus regrets the unjust fight , but what can he do ? He sees the figures in diverse attitudes , and recognises the men , and calling on each by name , asks his help . Disbelieving , he touches the bodies nearest to him . They are marble . He averts his gaze from Perseus , and in supplication , he stretches out his hands in acknowledgement , his arms still held out towards him . ‘
42228	42233	42227	42227	Perseus	776	’ , he cries , ‘
42334	42353	42358	42360	most cowardly Phineus	791	’ So speaking , not daring to look towards him to whom he directed his request , Perseus replied ‘
42432	42656	42657	42657	I	0	’ He spoke , and carried the head of Phorcys ’s daughter to where Phineus had turned his frightened face . As Phineus tried to avert his gaze , his neck hardened , and the tears on his cheeks were turned to stone . Now the frightened face , the suppliant expression , the submissive hands , and the slavish appearance , remained , in marble . The victorious descendant of Abas , with his bride , enters Argos , his ancestral city , and as the champion and vindicator of his grandfather Acrisius , who little deserves it , he attacks Proetus , who has made his brother a fugitive by force of arms , and seized his stronghold . But neither by force of arms , nor by possession of the stronghold he had taken in his wickedness , could he overcome the fierce gaze of the snake - wreathed monster . Still , you , O Polydectes , king of tiny Seriphos , softened neither by the young man ’s virtue , visible in all his efforts , nor by his suffering , nursed a harsh and unrelenting hatred , and there was no limit to your baseless anger . You disparaged the praise given him , and accused his account of the killing of Medusa of being a lie . ‘
42672	42790	42666	42666	Friends	6150	’ cried Perseus , and with the face of Medusa he turned the face of the king to bloodless stone . Up to this point Tritonian Minerva had given her time , freely , in friendship , to this brother of hers , conceived in a shower of gold , but now , surrounded by vaulted cloud , she vanished from the island of Seriphos , and leaving Cythnus and Gyarus behind on her right , she headed for Thebes , and Mount Helicon , home of the virgin Muses , crossing the sea by whichever way seemed quickest . Reaching it , she alighted there , and spoke to the sisters , learned in song , saying ‘
42844	42847	42834	42834	himself	2763	’ Urania replied ‘
42881	42965	42968	42968	Tritonia	627	’ , and she led her to the sacred waters . Pallas , having looked in wonder , for a long time , at this stream , made by the blow of the horse ’s hoof , gazed around her at the groves of ancient trees , the caves , and the grass , embroidered with innumerable flowers , and said that the daughters of Mnemosyne were equally happy in their home and their pursuits . At which one of the sisters answered , ‘
43280	43369	43375	43375	they	2783	’ The Muse was speaking : wings sounded in the air , and voices in greeting came out of the high branches . The daughter of Jupiter looked up , and questioned where the sound came from , that was so much like mouths speaking , and thought it human , though it was birdsong . Nine of them , magpies , that imitate everything , had settled in the branches , bemoaning their fate . While she wondered , the other began speaking , goddess to goddess , ‘
43774	43812	43844	43845	The Muse	6679	‘ This much she played on her lute , with singing voice . Then called on us , - but perhaps you are not at leisure , or free to listen to a repetition of our music ? ’
43813	43817	43819	43819	Pallas	793	‘ Do not stop ’
43821	43832	43834	43834	she	2802	‘ but sing your song again as you arranged it ! ’
43849	44198	43847	43847	her	6679	‘ We gave our best singer to the contest . Calliope , who rose , with her loose hair bound with ivy , tried out the plaintive strings with her fingers , then accompanied the wandering notes with this song . “ Ceres first turned the soil with curving plough , first ripened the crops and produce of the earth , first gave us laws : all things are Ceres ’s gift . My song is of her . If only I could create a song in any way worthy of the goddess ! This goddess is truly a worthy subject for my song . Trinacris , the vast isle of Sicily , had been heaped over the giant ’s limbs , and with its great mass oppressed buried Typhoeus , he who had dared to aspire to a place in heaven . He struggles it ’s true and often tries to rise , but his right hand is held by the promontory of Ausonian Pelorus , and his left hand by you , Pachynus . Lilybaeum presses on his legs , Etna weighs down his head , supine beneath it , Typhoeus throws ash from his mouth , and spits out flame . Often , a wrestler , he throws back the weight of earth , and tries to roll the high mountains and the cities from his body , and then the ground trembles , and even the lord of the silent kingdom is afraid lest he be exposed , and the soil split open in wide fissures , and the light admitted to scare the anxious dead . Fearing this disaster , the king of the dark had left his shadowy realm , and , drawn in his chariot by black horses , carefully circled the foundations of the Sicilian land . When he had checked and was satisfied that nothing was collapsing , he relinquished his fears . Then Venus , at Eryx , saw him moving , as she sat on the hillside , and embraced her winged son , Cupid , and said ‘
44380	44783	44362	44362	you	6113	’ So Venus spoke : he undid his quiver , and at his mother ’s bidding took an arrow , one from a thousand , and none was sharper , more certain , or better obeyed the bow . Then he bent the pliant tips against his knee , and with his barbed arrow struck Dis in the heart . ” “ Not far from the walls of Enna , there is a deep pool . Pergus is its name . Caÿster does not hear more songs than rise from the swans on its gliding waves . A wood encircles the waters , surrounds them on every side , and its leaves act as a veil , dispelling Phoebus ’s shafts . The branches give it coolness , and the moist soil , Tyrian purple flowers : there , it is everlasting Spring . While Proserpine was playing in this glade , and gathering violets or radiant lilies , while with girlish fondness she filled the folds of her gown , and her basket , trying to outdo her companions in her picking , Dis , almost in a moment , saw her , prized her , took her : so swift as this , is love . The frightened goddess cries out to her mother , to her friends , most of all to her mother , with piteous mouth . Since she had torn her dress at the opening , the flowers she had collected fell from her loosened tunic , and even their scattering caused her virgin tears . The ravisher whipped up his chariot , and urged on the horses , calling them by name , shaking out the shadowy , dark - dyed , reins , over their necks and manes , through deep pools , they say , and the sulphurous reeking swamps of the Palici , vented from a crevice of the earth , to Syracuse where the Bacchiadae , a people born of Corinth between two seas , laid out their city between unequal harbours . Between Cyane and Pisaean Arethusa , there is a bay enclosed by narrow arms . Here lived Cyane , best known of the Sicilian nymphs , from whom the name of the spring was also taken . She showed herself from the pool as far as her waist , and recognising the goddess , cried out to Dis , ‘
44785	44788	44362	44362	you	6113	’ , and ‘
44793	44794	44795	44795	You	2833	’ ‘
44849	45718	44839	44839	I	0	’ Speaking , she stretched her arms out at her sides , obstructing him . The son of Saturn could scarcely contain his wrath , and urging on the dread horses , he turned his royal sceptre with powerful arm , and plunged it through the bottom of the pool . The earth , pierced , made a road to Tartarus , and swallowed the headlong chariot , into the midst of the abyss . ” “ Cyane , mourning the rape of the goddess , and the contempt for the sanctities of her fountain , nursed an inconsolable grief in her silent heart , and pined away wholly with sorrow . She melted into those waters whose great goddess she had previously been . You might see her limbs becoming softened , her bones seeming pliant , her nails losing their hardness . First of all the slenderest parts dissolve : her dusky hair , her fingers and toes , her feet and ankles ( since it is no great transformation from fragile limbs to cool waters ) . Next her breast and back , shoulders and flanks slip away , vanishing into tenuous streams . At last the water runs in her ruined veins , and nothing remains that you could touch . Meanwhile the mother , fearing , searches in vain for the maid , through all the earth and sea . Neither the coming of dewy - haired Aurora , nor Hesperus , finds her resting . Lighting pine torches with both hands at Etna ’s fires , she wanders , unquiet , through the bitter darkness , and when the kindly light has dimmed the stars , she still seeks her child , from the rising of the sun till the setting of the sun . She found herself thirsty and weary from her efforts , and had not moistened her lips at any of the springs , when by chance she saw a hut with a roof of straw , and she knocked on its humble door . At that sound , an old woman emerged , and saw the goddess , and , when she asked for water , gave her something sweet made with malted barley . While she drank what she had been given a rash , foul - mouthed boy stood watching , and taunted her , and called her greedy . The goddess was offended , and threw the liquid she had not yet drunk , mixed with the grains of barley , in his face . His skin , absorbing it , became spotted , and where he had once had arms , he now had legs . A tail was added to his altered limbs , and he shrank to a little shape , so that he has no great power to harm . He is like a lesser lizard , a newt , of tiny size . The old woman wondered and wept , and , trying to touch the creature , it ran from her and searched out a place to hide . It has a name fitting for its offence , stellio , its body starred with various spots . It would take too long to tell through what lands and seas the goddess wandered . Searching the whole earth , she failed to find her daughter : she returned to Sicily , and while crossing it from end to end , she came to Cyane , who if she had not been changed would have told all . But though she wished to , she had neither mouth nor tongue , nor anything with which to speak . Still she revealed clear evidence , known to the mother , and showed Persephone ’s ribbon , fallen , by chance , into the sacred pool . As soon as she recognised it , the goddess tore her dishevelled hair , and beat her breast again and again with her hands , as if she at last comprehended the rape . She did not know yet where Persephone was , but condemned all the lands , and called them thankless and unworthy of her gift of corn , Sicily , that Trinacria , above all , where she had discovered the traces of her loss . So , in that place , with cruel hands , she broke the ploughs that turned up the soil , and , in her anger , dealt destruction to farmers , and the cattle in their fields , alike , and ordered the ever - faithful land to fail , and spoiled the sowing . The fertility of that country , acclaimed throughout the world , was spoken of as a fiction : the crops died as young shoots , destroyed by too much sun , and then by too much rain . Wind and weather harmed them , and hungry birds gathered the scattered seed . Thistles and darnel and stubborn grasses ruined the wheat harvest . ” “ Then Arethusa , once of Elis , whom Alpheus loved , lifted her head from her pool , and brushed the wet hair from her forehead , saying ‘
45968	46034	46035	46035	Jupiter	499	’ The mother was stunned to hear these words , as if petrified , and was , for a long time , like someone thunderstruck , until the blow of deep amazement became deep indignation . She rose , in her chariot , to the realms of heaven . There , her whole face clouded with hate , she appeared before Jove with dishevelled hair . ‘
46050	46054	46056	46057	the mother	2342	’ she cried . ‘
46169	46172	46173	46173	Our	2870	’ Jupiter replied ‘
46323	46883	46884	46884	I	0	’ ” “ He spoke , and Ceres felt sure of regaining her daughter . But the Fates would not allow it , for the girl had broken her fast , and wandering , innocently , in a well - tended garden , she had pulled down a reddish - purple pomegranate fruit , hanging from a tree , and , taking seven seeds from its yellow rind , squeezed them in her mouth . Ascalaphus was the only one to see it , whom , it is said , Orphne bore , to her Acheron , in the dark woods , she not the least known of the nymphs of Avernus . He saw , and by his cruel disclosure , prevented Proserpine ’s return . Then the queen of Erebus grieved , and changed the informant into a bird of ill omen : she sprinkled his head with water from the Phlegethon , and changed him to a beak , plumage , and a pair of huge eyes . Losing his own form he is covered by his tawny wings , and looks like a head , and long , curving claws . He scarcely stirs the feathers growing on his idle wings . He has become an odious bird , a messenger of future disaster , the screech owl , torpid by day , a fearful omen to mortal creatures . He indeed can be seen to have deserved his punishment , because of his disclosure and his words . But why have you , Sirens , skilled in song , daughters of Acheloüs , the feathers and claws of birds , while still bearing human faces ? Is it because you were numbered among the companions , when Proserpine gathered the flowers of Spring ? When you had searched in vain for her on land , you wanted , then , to cross the waves on beating wings , so that the waters would also know of your trouble . The gods were willing , and suddenly you saw your limbs covered with golden plumage . But , so that your song , born , sweetly , in our ears , and your rich vocal gift , might not be lost with your tongues , each virgin face and human voice remained . Now Jupiter , intervening , between his brother and grieving sister , divides the turning year , equally . And now the goddess , Persephone , shared divinity of the two kingdoms , spends so many months with her mother , so many months with her husband . The aspect of her face and mind alters in a moment . Now the goddess ’s looks are glad that even Dis could see were sad , a moment ago . Just as the sun , hidden , before , by clouds of rain , wins through and leaves the clouds . ” “ Ceres , kindly now , happy in the return of her daughter , asks what the cause of your flight was , Arethusa , and why you are now a sacred fountain . The waters fall silent while their goddess lifts her head from the deep pool , and wringing the water from her sea - green tresses , she tells of the former love of that river of Elis . ‘
46896	46899	46902	46902	them	2880	’ she said ‘
47163	47172	47173	47173	Alpheus	589	‘ What are you rushing for , Arethusa ? ’
47179	47185	47186	47186	He	2890	‘ Why are you rushing ? ’
47407	47445	47404	47404	I	0	‘ Help me : I will be taken . Diana , help the one who bore your weapons for you , whom you often gave your bow to carry , and your quiver with all its arrows ! ’
47501	47507	47485	47485	he	2896	‘ Arethusa , O Arethusa ! ’
47736	47887	47895	47895	my	0	’ ” “ That was as far as Arethusa went . The goddess of all that is fertile , fastened twin dragons to her chariot , curbing them with the bit , between their teeth , and was carried through the air , between heaven and earth . Reaching Eleusis , by Athens , city of Tritonian Minerva , she gave her swift chariot to Triptolemus , and ordered him to scatter the seeds she gave , partly in untilled soil , partly in fields reclaimed , after lying for a long time fallow . Now the youth was carried high over Europe and Asia . He turned his face towards Scythia where , Lyncus was king . He stood before the king ’s household gods . He was asked how he had come there , and the reason for his journey , his name and his country . He said ‘
47956	48040	47944	47944	they	2914	’ The barbarian was jealous . So that he might be the author , of so great a gift , he received him like a guest , but attacked Triptolemus , with a sword , while he was in deep sleep . As he attempted to pierce the youth ’s breast , Ceres turned the king into a lynx , then ordered the youth , of Athens , the city of Mopsopus , to drive the sacred team back through the air . ” ‘
48247	48277	48219	48223	the slanderers of the woods	2924	’ Tritonian Minerva had listened to every word , and approved of the Aonian Muses ’s song , and their justified indignation . Then she said , to herself , ‘
48305	48548	48219	48223	the slanderers of the woods	2924	’ Her thoughts turned to Arachne , of Maeonia , whom she had heard would not give her due credit , in the art of spinning . The girl was not known for her place of birth , or family , but for her skill . Her father , Idmon of Colophon , dyed the absorbent wool purple , with Phocaean murex . Her mother was dead . She too had been of humble birth , and the father the same . Nevertheless , though she lived in a modest home , in little Hypaepa , Arachne had gained a name for artistry , throughout the cities of Lydia . Often the nymphs of Mount Tmolus deserted their vine - covered slopes , and the nymphs of the River Pactolus deserted their waves , to examine her wonderful workmanship . It was not only a joy to see the finished cloths , but also to watch them made : so much beauty added to art . Whether at first she was winding the rough yarn into a new ball , or working the stuff with her fingers , teasing out the clouds of wool , repeatedly , drawing them into long equal threads , twirling the slender spindle with practised thumb , or embroidering with her needle , you could see she was taught by Pallas . Yet she denied it , and took offence at the idea of such a teacher . ‘
48552	48555	48219	48223	the slanderers of the woods	2924	’ she said ‘
48566	48608	48219	48223	the slanderers of the woods	2924	’ . Pallas Minerva took the shape of an old woman : adding grey hair to her temples , and ageing her limbs , which she supported with a stick . Then she spoke , to the girl , as follows . ‘
48670	48708	48662	48662	she	5864	’ Arachne looked fiercely at her and left the work she was on : scarcely restraining her hands , and with dark anger in her face . Pallas , disguised it is true , received this answer . ‘
48793	48797	48788	48788	she	6285	’ The goddess said ‘
48802	49507	48788	48788	she	6285	’ and , relinquishing the old woman ’s form , revealed Pallas Minerva . The nymphs and the Phrygian women worshipped her godhead : the girl alone remained unafraid , yet she did blush , as the sky is accustomed to redden when Aurora first stirs , and , after a while , to whiten at the sun from the east . She is stubborn in her attempt , and rushes on to her fate , eager for a worthless prize . Now , Jupiter ’s daughter does not refuse , and does not give warning , or delay the contest a moment . Immediately they both position themselves , in separate places , and stretch out the fine threads , for the warp , over twin frames . The frame is fastened to the cross - beam ; the threads of the warp separated with the reed ; the thread of the weft is inserted between , in the pointed shuttles that their fingers have readied ; and , drawn through the warp , the threads of the weft are beaten into place , struck by the comb ’s notched teeth . They each work quickly , and , with their clothes gathered in tight , under their breasts , apply skilful arms , their zeal not making it seem like work . There , shades of purple , dyed in Tyrian bronze vessels , are woven into the cloth , and also lighter colours , shading off gradually . The threads that touch seem the same , but the extremes are distant , as when , often , after a rainstorm , the expanse of the sky , struck by the sunlight , is stained by a rainbow in one vast arch , in which a thousand separate colours shine , but the eye itself still can not see the transitions . There , are inserted lasting threads of gold , and an ancient tale is spun in the web . Pallas Athene depicts the hill of Mars , and the court of the Aeropagus , in Cecrops ’s Athens , and the old dispute between Neptune and herself , as to who had the right to the city and its name . There the twelve gods sit in great majesty , on their high thrones , with Jupiter in the middle . She weaves the gods with their familiar attributes . The image of Jupiter is a royal one . There she portrays the Ocean god , standing and striking the rough stone , with his long trident , and seawater flowing from the centre of the shattered rock , a token of his claim to the city . She gives herself a shield , a sharp pointed spear , and a helmet for her head , while the aegis protects her breast . She shows an olive - tree with pale trunk , thick with fruit , born from the earth at a blow from her spear , the gods marvelling : and Victory crowns the work . Then she adds four scenes of contest in the four corners , each with miniature figures , in their own clear colours , so that her rival might learn , from the examples quoted , what prize she might expect , for her outrageous daring . One corner shows Thracian Mount Rhodope and Mount Haemus , now icy peaks , once mortal beings who ascribed the names of the highest gods to themselves . A second corner shows the miserable fate of the queen of the Pygmies : how Juno , having overcome her in a contest , ordered her to become a crane and make war on her own people . Also she pictures Antigone , whom Queen Juno turned into a bird for having dared to compete with Jupiter ’s great consort : neither her father Laomedon , nor her city Ilium were of any use to her , but taking wing as a white stork she applauds herself with clattering beak . The only corner left shows Cinyras , bereaved : and he is seen weeping as he clasps the stone steps of the temple that were once his daughters ’
49903	49968	49882	49887	The golden - haired warrior goddess	2952	’ crimes , and as she held her shuttle made of boxwood from Mount Cytorus , she struck Idmonian Arachne , three or four times , on the forehead . The unfortunate girl could not bear it , and courageously slipped a noose around her neck : Pallas , in pity , lifted her , as she hung there , and said these words , ‘
50007	50266	50267	50269	Women of Thebes	2957	’ Departing after saying this , she sprinkled her with the juice of Hecate ’s herb , and immediately at the touch of this dark poison , Arachne ’s hair fell out . With it went her nose and ears , her head shrank to the smallest size , and her whole body became tiny . Her slender fingers stuck to her sides as legs , the rest is belly , from which she still spins a thread , and , as a spider , weaves her ancient web . All of Lydia murmurs : the tale goes through the towns of Phrygia , and fills the whole world with talk . Niobe had known Arachne . As a girl , before her marriage , she had lived in Maeonia , near Mount Sipylus . Nevertheless she was not warned by her countrywoman ’s fate , to give the gods precedence , and use more modest words . Many things swelled her pride , but neither her husband Amphion ’s marvellous art in music , nor both of their high lineages , nor the might of their great kingdom of Thebes , pleased her , though they did please her , as much as her children did . And Niobe would have been spoken of as the most fortunate of mothers , if she had not seemed so to herself . Now Manto , the daughter of Tiresias , prescient of the future , stirred by divine impulse , went through the middle of the streets , declaiming . ‘
50311	50406	50304	50304	Latona	895	’ They obey : all the Theban women , as commanded , dress their temples with sweet - bay , and bring incense and words of prayer to the sacred flames . Look , Niobe comes , followed by a crowded thong , visible , in her Phrygian robes woven with gold , and as beautiful as anger will let her be . Turning her lovely head with the hair falling loose over both her shoulders , she pauses , and looks around with pride in her eyes , from her full height , saying ‘
50840	50885	50895	50896	your mother	1807	’ They relinquish them , and leave the rite unfinished , except what is their right , reverencing the goddess in a secret murmur . The goddess was deeply angered , and on the summit of Mount Cynthus she spoke to her twin children . ‘
50992	51008	50983	50983	she	3005	’ Latona would have added her entreaties to what she had related , but Phoebus cried ‘
51017	51148	51151	51151	I	0	’ Phoebe said the same , and falling swiftly through the air , concealed by clouds , they reached the house of Cadmus . There was a broad , open plain near the walls , flattened by the constant passage of horses , where many wheels and hard hooves had levelled the turf beneath them . There , a number of Amphion ’s seven sons mounted on their strong horses , and sitting firmly on their backs , bright with Tyrian purple , guided them using reins heavy with gold . While Ismenus , one of these , who had been the first of his mother ’s burdens , was wheeling his horse ’s path around in an unerring circle , and hauling at the foaming bit , he cried out ‘
51155	51592	51151	51151	I	0	’ and revealed an arrow fixed in his chest , and loosing the reins from his dying hands , slipped gradually , sideways , over his mount ’s right shoulder . Next Sipylus , hearing the sound of a quiver in the empty air , let out the reins , just as a shipmaster sensing a storm runs for it when he sees the cloud , and claps on all sail , so that not even the slightest breeze is lost . Still giving full rein , he was overtaken , by the arrow none can avoid , and the shaft stuck quivering in his neck , and the naked tip protruded from his throat . Leaning forward , as he was , he rolled down over the mane and the galloping hooves , and stained the ground with warm blood . Unlucky Phaedimus , and Tantalus , who carried his grandfather ’s name , at the end of the usual task imposed on them , had joined the exercise of the young men , and were gleaming with oil in the wrestling match . And now they were fully engaged , in a tight hold , chest to chest , when an arrow , loosed from the taut bow , pierced them both , as they were . They groaned as one , and fell as one , their limbs contorted with pain . As they lay there , they cast a last dying look , as one , and , as one , gave up the ghost . Alphenor saw them die , and striking at his breast in anguish , he ran to them to lift their cold bodies in his embrace . In this filial service he also fell , for Delian Apollo tore at his innermost parts with deadly steel . As the shaft was removed , a section of his lung was drawn with it , caught on the barbs , and with his life ’s blood his spirit rushed out into the air . But it was not a simple wound that longhaired Damasicthon suffered . He was hit where the shin begins , and where the sinews of the knee leave a soft place between . While he was trying to pull out the fatal shaft with his hand , another arrow was driven into his throat as far as the feathers . The rush of blood expelled it , and gushing out , spurted high in the air , in a long jet . The last son , Ilioneus , stretched out his arms in vain entreaty . ‘
51604	51820	51151	51151	I	0	’ he cried , unaware that he need not ask them all . The archer god Apollo was moved , though already the dart could not be recalled : yet only a slight wound killed the boy , the arrow not striking deeply in his heart . The rumour of trouble , the people ’s sorrow , and the tears of her own family , confirming sudden disaster to the mother , left her astounded that the gods could have done it , and angered that they had such power , and dared to use it . Now , she learned that the father , Amphion , driving the iron blade through his heart , had , in dying , ended pain and life together . Alas , how different this Niobe from that Niobe , the one , who a moment ago chased the people from Latona ’s altar , and made her way through the city with head held high , enviable to her friends , and now more to be pitied by her enemies . She threw herself on the cold bodies , and without regard for due ceremony , gave all her sons a last kiss . Turning from them she lifted her bruised arms to the sky , and cried out ‘
51890	51932	51888	51888	you	3011	’ She spoke , and the twang of a taut bowstring sounded , terrifying all of them , except Niobe . Pain gave her courage . The sisters , with black garments , and loosened hair , were standing by their brothers ’
52052	52072	52074	52074	she	2342	‘ Leave me just one , the youngest ! I only ask for one , the youngest of all ! ’
52284	52434	52276	52276	they	3034	‘ In Lycia ’s fertile fields , in ancient times , also , the farmers spurned the goddess , and not without suffering for it . The thing is not well known , it is true , because the men were unknown , nevertheless , it was wonderful . I myself saw the place , and the lake made notable by the strangeness of it , since my father , getting old , and unable to endure the journey , had ordered me to collect some choice cattle from there , and one of the men of that country had offered himself as a guide . While I crossed the pastureland with him , there was an old altar , black with ashes , standing in the middle of a lake , surrounded by trembling reeds . My guide stopped and , shivering with fear , said in a murmur ‘
52440	52450	52276	52276	they	3034	’ and I , similarly , said in a murmur ‘
52454	52479	52480	52481	Young man	3035	’ Then I asked him whether it was an altar to the Naiads , Faunus , or a local god , and my friend replied ‘
52694	52845	52687	52688	The goddess	5864	‘ Why do you forbid me your waters ? The use of water is everyone ’s right . Nature has not made the sun , or the air , or the clear waves , private things . I come for a public gift , and yet I beg you to grant it to me as a suppliant . I was not preparing to bathe my limbs and my weary body here , only to quench my thirst . My mouth lacks moisture from speaking , my throat is dry , and there ’s scarcely a path here for speech . A drink of water would be nectar to me , and I would bear witness to accepting life from it , as well : you will be giving life from your waves . Let these children move you , also , who stretch their little arms out from my breast . ’
52969	52977	52967	52967	she	3059	‘ Live in that swamp for ever ! ’
53186	53200	53202	53202	he	906	‘ Why do you peel me out of myself ? Aah ! I repent ’
53207	53217	53202	53202	he	906	‘ Aah ! Music is not worth this pain ! ’
53916	53970	53908	53908	Procne	910	‘ If any thanks are due me , either send me to see my sister , or let my sister come here . You can promise my father she will return after a brief stay . It would be worth a great deal to me , if you allowed me to see Philomela . ’
54622	54754	54756	54756	he	3161	‘ Dear son , since affectionate reasons compel it , and both of them desire it ( you too have desired it , Tereus ) , I give her over to you , and by your honour , by the entreaty of a heart joined to yours , and by the gods above , I beg you , protect her with a father ’s love , and send back to me , as soon as is possible ( it will be all too long a wait for me ) , this sweet comfort of my old age . You too , as soon as is possible ( it is enough that your sister is so far away ) , if you are at all dutiful , Philomela , return to me ! ’
54864	54878	54879	54879	He	3161	‘ I have won ! I carry with me what I wished for ! ’
55140	55365	55138	55138	she	913	‘ Oh , you savage . Oh , what an evil , cruel , thing you have done . Did you care nothing for my father ’s trust , sealed with holy tears , my sister ’s affection , my own virginity , your marriage vows ? You have confounded everything . I have been forced to become my sister ’s rival . You are joined to both . Now Procne will be my enemy ! Why not rob me of life as well , you traitor , so that no crime escapes you ? If only you had done it before that impious act . Then my shade would have been free of guilt . Yet , if the gods above witness such things , if the powers of heaven mean anything , if all is not lost , as I am , then one day you will pay me for this ! I , without shame , will tell what you have done . If I get the chance it will be in front of everyone . If I am kept imprisoned in these woods , I will fill the woods with it , and move the stones , that know of my guilt , to pity . The skies will hear of it , and any god that may be there ! ’
56159	56272	56149	56149	her	910	‘ Now is not the time for tears , but for the sword , or for what overcomes the sword , if you know of such a thing . I am prepared for any wickedness , sister ; to set the palace alight with a torch , and throw Tereus , the author of this , into the midst of the flames ; or to cut out his eyes and tongue , and the parts which brought shame to you ; or to force out his guilty spirit through a thousand wounds ! I am ready for any enormity : but what it should be , I still do not know yet . ’
56305	56315	56303	56303	she	5953	‘ Ah ! How like your father you are ! ’
56423	56487	56421	56421	she	5953	‘ Why should the one be able to speak his endearments , while the other is silent , her tongue torn out ? Though he calls me mother , why can she not call me sister ? Look at the husband you are bride to , Pandion ’s daughter ! This is unworthy of you ! Affection is criminal in a wife of Tereus ’
56562	56567	56547	56547	he	912	‘ Mother ! Mother ! ’
56708	56712	56718	56718	her	910	‘ Fetch Itys here ’
56738	56752	56753	56753	He	908	‘ You have him there , inside , the one you ask for . ’
57198	57377	57179	57179	he	497	‘ I deserve it ! Why have I relinquished my own weapons , force and ferocity , and anger and menacing moods , and turned to prayers , that are unbecoming for me to use ? Force is fitting for me . By force , I drive forward the mists , by force move the sea . I overturn knotted oaks , harden the snow , and strike earth with hail . And , when I meet my brothers under the open sky ( since that is my battleground ) I struggle so fiercely with them that the midst of the heavens echoes with our collisions , and lightning leaps , hurled from the vaulted clouds . So , when I penetrate the hollow openings of the earth , and apply my proud back to the deepest cave roofs , I trouble the shades , and the whole world with the tremors . That is how I should have sought a wife , and not become Erectheus ’s son - in - law by prayer but by action . ’
57802	58642	58643	58643	She	3293	‘ Medea , you struggle in vain : some god , I do not know which , opposes you . I wonder if this , or something , like this , is what people indeed call love ? Or why would the tasks my father demands of Jason seem so hard ? They are more than hard ! Why am I afraid of his death , when I have scarcely seen him ? What is the cause of all this fear ? Quench , if you can , unhappy girl , these flames that you feel in your virgin heart ! If I could , I would be wiser ! But a strange power draws me to him against my will . Love urges one thing : reason another . I see , and I desire the better : I follow the worse . Why do you burn for a stranger , royal virgin , and dream of marriage in an alien land ? This earth can also give you what you can love . Whether he lives or dies , is in the hands of the gods . Let him live ! I can pray for this even if I may not love him : what is Jason guilty of ? Who , but the heartless , would not be touched by Jason ’s youth , and birth , and courage ? Who , though the other qualities were absent , could not be stirred by his beauty ? He has stirred my heart , indeed . And unless I offer my help , he will feel the fiery breath of the bronze - footed bulls ; have to meet that enemy , sprung from the soil , born of his own sowing ; or be given as captured prey to the dragon ’s greed . If I allow this , then I am born of the tigress : then I show I have a heart of stone and iron ! Why can I not watch him die , and shame my eyes by seeing ? Why do I not urge the bulls on , to meet him , and the wild earth - born warriors , and the unsleeping dragon ? Let the gods also desire the better ! Though it is not for me to pray for , but to bring about . Shall I betray my father ’s country ? Shall some unknown be saved by my powers , and unhurt because of me , without me , set his sails to the wind , and be husband to another , leaving Medea to be punished ? If he could do that , if he could set another woman above me , let him die , the ungrateful man ! But his look , his nobility of spirit , and his graceful form , do not make me fear deceit or forgetfulness of my kindness . And he will give me his word beforehand , and I will gather the gods to witness our pledge . Why fear when it is certain ? Prepare yourself , and dispel all delay : Jason will be for ever in your debt , take you to himself in sacred marriage , and through the cities of Pelasgian Greece , the crowds of women will glorify you as his saviour . Carried by the winds , shall I leave my native country , my sister , my brother , my father , and my gods ? Well then , my father is barbarous , and my country is savage , and my brother is still a child : my sister ’s prayers are for me , and the greatest god is within ! I will not be leaving greatness behind , but pursuing greatness : honour as a saviour of these Achaean people , familiarity with a better land and with cities whose fame is flourishing even here , the culture and arts of those places , and the man , the son of Aeson , for whom I would barter those things that the wide world owns , joined to whom I will be called fortunate , dear to the gods , and my head will be crowned with the stars . What of the stories of mountains that clash together in mid - ocean , and Charybdis the bane of sailors , now sucking in , now spewing out the sea , and rapacious dog - headed Scylla , yelping over the Sicilian deeps ? Well , holding what I love , clinging to Jason ’s breast , I shall be carried over the wide seas : in his arms , I will fear nothing , or if I am afraid , I will only be afraid for him . But do you call that marriage , Medea , and clothe your fault with fair names ? Consider instead , how great a sin you are near to , and while you can , shun the crime ! ’
58903	58940	58941	58941	He	3301	‘ I see what I am doing : it is not ignorance of the truth that ensnares me , but love . Your salvation is in my gift , but being saved , remember your promise ! ’
59407	59769	59818	59818	Jason	924	’ faces fell in fear , and their courage failed them , when they saw these warriors preparing to hurl their sharp spears , at the head of the Haemonian hero . She also , who had rendered him safe , was afraid . When she saw the solitary youth attacked by so many enemies , she grew pale , and sat there , suddenly cold and bloodless . And in case the herbs she had given him had not been potent enough , she chanted a spell to support them , and called on her secret arts . He threw a boulder into the midst of his enemies , and this turned their attack , on him , against themselves . The earth - born brothers died at each other ’s hands , and fell as in civil war . The Achaeans cheered , and clung to the victor , and hugged him in eager embraces . You also , princess among the Barbarians , longed to hold the victorious man : but modesty prevented it . Still , you might have held him , but concern for your reputation stopped you from doing so . What you might fittingly do you did , rejoicing silently , giving thanks , for your incantations , and the gods who inspired them . The final task was to put the dragon to sleep with the magic drugs . Known for its crest , its triple tongues and curved fangs , it was the dread guardian of the tree ’s gold . But when Jason had sprinkled it with the Lethean juice of a certain herb , and three times repeated the words that bring tranquil sleep , that calm the rough seas and turbulent rivers , sleep came to those sleepless eyes , and the heroic son of Aeson gained the Golden Fleece . Proud of his prize , and taking with him a further prize , the one who had helped him gain it , the hero , and his wife Medea , returned to the harbour at Iolchos . The elderly Haemonian mothers and fathers bring offerings to mark their sons ’
59824	59888	59818	59818	Jason	924	‘ O my wife , to whom I confess I owe my life , though you have already given me everything , and the total of all your kindnesses is beyond any promises we made , let your incantations , if they can ( what indeed can they not do ? ) reduce my own years and add them to my father ’s ! ’
59932	60027	59930	59930	she	927	‘ Husband , what dreadful words have escaped your lips ? Do you think I can transfer any part of your life to another ? Hecate would not allow it : nor is yours a just request . But I will try to grant a greater gift than the one you ask for , Jason . If only the Triple Goddess will aid me , and give her assent in person to this great act of daring , I will attempt to renew your father ’s length of years , without need for yours . ’
60184	60227	60146	60146	she	927	‘ Night , most faithful keeper of our secret rites ; Stars , that , with the golden moon , succeed the fires of light ; Triple Hecate , you who know all our undertakings , and come , to aid the witches ’
60436	60555	60564	60564	her	3342	’ hot flame for me : force their necks to bow , beneath the heavy yoke , that never pulled the curving plough : You turn the savage warfare , born of the serpent ’s teeth , against itself , and lull the watcher , innocent of sleep ; that guard deceived , bring golden spoil , to the towns of Greece . Now I need the juice by which old age may be renewed , that can regain the prime of years , return the flower of youth , and You will grant it . Not in vain , stars glittered in reply : not in vain , winged dragons bring my chariot , through the sky . ’
60575	61672	60568	60568	she	3342	’ bridled necks , and shaken the light reins in her hands , she was snatched up on high . She looked down on Thessalian Tempe far below , and sent the dragons to certain places that she knew . She considered those herbs that grow on Mount Ossa , those of Mount Pelion , Othrys and Pindus , and higher Olympus , and of those that pleased her , plucked some by the roots , and cut others , with a curved pruning - knife of bronze . Many she chose , as well , from the banks of the Apidanus . Many she chose , as well , from the Amphrysus . Nor did she omit the Enipeus . Peneus , and Spercheus ’s waters gave something , and the reedy shores of Boebe . And at Anthedon , by Euboea , she picked a plant of long life , not yet famous for the change it made in Glaucus ’s body . Then she returned , after nine days and nine nights surveying all the lands she had crossed , from her chariot , drawn by the winged dragons . The dragons had only smelt the herbs , yet they shed their skins of many years . Reaching her door and threshold , she stopped on the outside , and under the open sky , avoiding contact with any man , she set up two altars of turf , one on the right to Hecate , one on the left to Youth . She wreathed them with sacred boughs from the wildwood , then dug two trenches near by in the earth , and performed the sacrifice , plunging her knife into the throat of a black - fleeced sheep , and drenching the wide ditches with blood . She poured over it cups of pure honey , and again she poured over it cups of warm milk , uttering words as she did so , calling on the spirits of the earth , and begging the shadowy king and his stolen bride , not to be too quick to steal life from the old man ’s limbs . When she had appeased the gods by prayer and murmured a while , she ordered Aeson ’s exhausted body to be carried into the air , and freeing him to deep sleep with her spells , she stretched him out like a corpse on a bed of herbs . She ordered Jason , his son , to go far off , and the attendants to go far off , and warned them to keep profane eyes away from the mysteries . They went as she had ordered . Medea , with streaming hair , circled the burning altars , like a Bacchante , and dipping many - branched torches into the black ditches filled with blood , she lit them , once they were darkened , at the twin altars . Three times with fire , three times with water , three times with sulphur , she purified the old man . Meanwhile a potent mixture is heating in a bronze cauldron set on the flames , bubbling , and seething , white with turbulent froth . She boils there , roots dug from a Thessalian valley , seeds , flowerheads , and dark juices . She throws in precious stones searched for in the distant east , and sands that the ebbing tide of ocean washes . She adds hoar - frost collected by night under the moon , the wings and flesh of a vile screech - owl , and the slavering foam of a sacrificed were - wolf , that can change its savage features to those of a man . She does not forget the scaly skin of a thin Cinyphian water - snake , the liver of a long - lived stag , the eggs and the head of a crow that has lived for nine human life - times . With these , and a thousand other nameless things , the barbarian witch pursued her greater than mortal purpose . She stirred it all with a long - dry branch of a fruitful olive , mixing the depths with the surface . Look ! The ancient staff turned in the hot cauldron , first grew green again , then in a short time sprouted leaves , and was , suddenly , heavily loaded with olives . And whenever the flames caused froth to spatter from the hollow bronze , and warm drops to fall on the earth , the soil blossomed , and flowers and soft grasses grew . As soon as she saw this , Medea unsheathed a knife , and cut the old man ’s throat , and letting the old blood out , filled the dry veins with the juice . When Aeson had absorbed it , part through his mouth , and part through the wound , the white of his hair and beard quickly vanished , and a dark colour took its place . At a stroke his leanness went , and his pallor and dullness of mind . The deep hollows were filled with rounded flesh , and his limbs expanded . Aeson marvelled , recalling that this was his self of forty years ago . Bacchus saw this wondrous miracle from heaven ’s heights , and realising from it , that the Nymphs of Mount Nysa , who had nursed him , could have their youth restored , he secured that gift from the witch of Colchis . There was no end to her magic . Phasian Medea , pretending to a sham quarrel with her husband , fled as a suppliant to Pelias ’s threshold , he who had usurped Aeson ’s throne . There , the king ’s daughters received her , since he himself was weighed down by the years . The lying Colchian soon won them over by a skilful show of friendship , and when she told them of one of her greatest gifts , the removal of Aeson ’s many years , and lingered over it , hope was aroused in Pelias ’s daughters that similar magic arts might rejuvenate their father . They begged her , and told her to set a price however great . She was silent for a moment , and appeared to hesitate , keeping the minds of her petitioners in suspense by a show of solemn pretence . When , eventually , she promised to do it , she said ‘
61706	61950	61953	61953	you	3348	’ Straight away the woolly creature , worn out by innumerable years , was dragged forward , his horns curving round his hollow temples . When the witch had cut his wizened throat with her Thessalian knife , hardly staining the blade with blood , she immersed the sheep ’s carcass in the bronze cauldron , along with her powerful magic herbs . These shrank its limbs , melted away its horns , and , with its horns , the years . A high - pitched bleating came from inside the vessel , and while they were wondering at the bleating , a lamb leapt out , and frisked away , seeking the udder and milk . Pelias ’s daughters were stunned , and now the truth of her promise had been displayed , they insisted even more eagerly . Three times Phoebus had unyoked his horses , after their plunge into the western ocean , and on the fourth night the stars were glittering in all their radiance , when the deceitful daughter of Aeetes set clear water , and herbs , but ineffectual ones , over a blazing fire . And now the king and his guards also were deep in death - like sleep , achieved by her incantations and the power of her magic spells . The king ’s daughters , at her command , crossed the threshold , with the Colchian witch , and stood around his bed . ‘
61959	61963	61953	61953	you	3348	’ she said . ‘
62043	62142	62143	62143	Daughters	2264	’ Urged on by these words , the more love each had for him , the quicker she was to act without love , and did evil , to avoid greater evil . Nevertheless they could not bear to see their own blows , and turned their eyes away , and with averted faces , wounded him blindly with cruel hands . Streaming blood , the old man still raised himself on his elbow , and , though mutilated , tried to rise from his bed . Stretching his pallid hands out among the many weapons , he cried ‘
62164	62577	62578	62578	You	3353	’ Their strength and courage vanished . But as he was about to utter more words , the Colchian witch cut his throat , and plunged his torn body into the seething water . She would not have escaped punishment had she not taken to the air , with her winged dragons . Through the high sky , clockwise , she fled , over the shadowy slopes of Pelion , Chiron ’s home ; over Othrys and the places made famous by the ancient fate of Cerambus , who , aided by the nymphs and changed to a winged scarab beetle , lifted into the air , when the all - powerful sea drowned the solid earth , and so escaped un - drowned from Deucalion ’s flood . She passed Aeolian Pitane on the left , with its huge stone serpent image , and Ida ’s grove where Liber concealed , in the deceptive shape of a stag , the bullock stolen by his son . She passed the place where the father of Corythus , Paris , lay , buried under a little sand ; and where Hecuba , changed to a black bitch of Hecate , Maera , spread terror through the fields with her strange barking . She flew over Astypalaea , the city of Eurypylus , where the women of the island , of Cos , acquired horns when they abused Hercules , as he and his company departed : over Rhodes , beloved of Phoebus : and the Telchines of the city of Ialysos on Rhodes , whose eyes corrupted everything they looked on , so that Jupiter , disgusted with them , sank them under his brother ’s ocean waves . She passed the walls of ancient Carthaea , on the island of Ceos , where Alcidamas , as a father , would marvel , one day , that a peace - loving dove could spring from the body of his daughter , Ctesylla . Then she saw Lake Hyrie , and Cycnean Tempe , made famous suddenly by a swan . There Phylius , at the boy Cycnus ’s command , brought him birds and a fierce lion he had tamed . Ordered to overcome a wild bull as well , he did overcome him , but angry that his love was rejected so often , he refused to grant this last gift of a bull , when asked . Cycnus , angered , said ‘
62583	63162	63163	63167	soil - less ’ aconites	7169	’ and leapt from a high cliff . All thought he had fallen , but changed to a swan he beat through the air on white wings , though his mother , Hyrie , not knowing he was safe , pined away with weeping , and became the lake that carries her name . Near there was the city of Pleuron , where Combe the daughter of Ophius , on flickering wings , escaped death at the hands of her sons , the Aetolian Curetes . And then Medea looked down at the fields of Calaurea ’s isle , sacred to Leto , whose king and queen were also changed to birds . On her right was Cyllene , where Menephron lay with his mother , as though he were a wild beast . Further on she sees the Cephisus , the river - god lamenting his grandson ’s fate , changed by Apollo into a lumbering seal , and the home of Eumelus , mourning his son Botres , reborn as a bird , the bee - eater , in the air . At last , the dragon ’s wings brought her to Corinth , the ancient Ephyre , and its Pirenian spring . Here , tradition says , that in earliest times , human bodies sprang from fungi , swollen by rain . After Jason ’s new bride Glauce had been consumed by the fires of vengeful Colchian witchcraft and both the Isthmus ’s gulfs had witnessed flame consuming the king ’s palace , Medea impiously bathed her sword in the blood of their sons . Then , after performing this evil act , she fled from Jason ’s wrath . Carried by her dragons that are born of the Titans , she reached Pallas ’s citadel of Athens . This once knew you Phene , the most righteous , and you old Periphas , both flying in the air , as birds , the eagle and the osprey : and Alcyone , granddaughter of Polypemon , resting on strange new wings . It was Aegeus who gave Medea sanctuary there , damned thereafter by that one action : and not content with taking her in , he even entered into a contract of marriage with her . Now Theseus came to Athens , Aegeus ’s son , but as yet unknown to him . He , by his courage , had brought peace to the Isthmus between the two gulfs . Medea , seeking his destruction , prepared a mixture of poisonous aconite , she had brought with her from the coast of Scythia . This poison is said to have dripped from the teeth of Cerberus , the Echidnean dog . There is a dark cavern with a gaping mouth , and a path into the depths , up which Hercules , hero of Tiryns , dragged the dog , tied with steel chains , resisting and twisting its eyes away from the daylight and the shining rays . Cerberus , provoked to a rabid frenzy , filled all the air with his simultaneous three - headed howling , and spattered the green fields with white flecks of foam . These are supposed to have congealed and found food to multiply , gaining harmful strength from the rich soil . Because they are long - lived , springing from the hard rock , the country people call these shoots , of wolf - bane , ‘
63166	63350	63351	63352	Great Theseus	958	’ aconites . Through his wife ’s cunning Aegeus , the father , himself offered the poison to his son , as if he were a stranger . Theseus , unwittingly , had taken the cup he was given in his right hand , when his father recognised the emblems of his own house , on the ivory hilt of his son ’s sword , and knocked the evil drink away from his mouth . But she escaped death , in a dark mist , raised by her incantations . Though the father was overjoyed that his son was unharmed , he was still horrified that so great a crime could have come so close to success . He lit fires on the altars , and heaped gifts for the gods . His axes struck the mountainous necks of oxen , their horns tied with the sacrificial ribbons . They say that was the happiest day that dawned in the city of Erectheus . The statesmen celebrated among the people , and they sang verses , made even more inspired by the wine . ‘
63540	63894	63895	63895	I	0	’ The palace echoed to the people ’s applause and the prayers of friends , and there was no sad place in the whole city . Nevertheless Aegeus ’s pleasure in receiving his son was not carefree ( indeed , joy is never complete , and some trouble always comes to spoil our delight ) . Minos , of Crete , was preparing for war . Powerful in men and ships , his anger as a father was more powerful still , and by right of arms he was seeking to avenge the death of Androgeos , his son . But first he acquired allies for his war , crossing the sea in the swift fleet that was his strength . The island of Anaphe joined with him , and that of Astypalaea ( Anaphe by promises , Astypalaea by Cretan supremacy in war ) ; low - lying Myconos , and chalky - soiled Cimolos ; Syros flowering with thyme , flat Seriphos , marble - cliffed Paros , and Siphnos , betrayed to him by that disloyal princess , Arne , whom , when she had taken the gold her greed demanded , the gods changed into a bird , the black - footed , black - winged jackdaw , that still delights in gold . But Oliaros gave no aid to the Cretan ships ; nor Didyme , Tenos , Andros , Gyaros ; nor Peparethos rich in bright olives . Sailing northwest Minos sought Oenopia , the kingdom of the Aeacidae . They called it Oenopia in ancient times , but Aeacus himself named it Aegina after his mother . The crowd rushed down , to meet Minos , wanting to see so famous a man . Telamon went to him , and Peleus , junior to Telamon , and Phocus , the third child , their half - brother . Aeacus himself came , also , slow with the burden of years , and asked the cause of his visit . The ruler of a hundred cities sighed , reminded of his grief for his son , and replied ‘
63928	63934	63935	63935	You	3369	’ The grandson of Asopus said ‘
63970	63978	63979	63979	Your	3369	’ Minos turned away , sadly , saying ‘
63985	64201	63979	63979	Your	3369	’ , since he thought it more useful to threaten war than to fight , and consume his strength too soon . The Cretan fleet could still be seen from Aegina ’s walls , when a ship from Athens arrived , under full sail , and entered the allied port , bearing Cephalus , and likewise greetings from his country . Though they had not seen him for a long time , the sons of Aeacus still knew him , and clasped his right hand , and led him to their father ’s house . The hero went forward , observed on all sides , even now retaining traces of his former beauty , carrying a branch of his country ’s olive . And to right and left , he , the elder , had two younger men , Clytos and Butes , the sons of Pallas . After meeting and exchanging a few words , Cephalus described his mandate from Athens , asking for help and quoting the treaty sworn to by their ancestors , adding that Minos was out to control all Achaia . When he had invoked the treaty , in this way , to aid his cause , Aeacus , resting his left hand on the handle of his sceptre , replied ‘
64262	64263	64264	64264	I	0	’ ‘
64271	64274	64243	64243	men	5788	’ Cephalus said ‘
64324	64332	64314	64314	I	0	’ Aeacus sighed , and spoke sadly . ‘
65447	65494	65504	65504	I	0	’ flames . There was no one left to mourn , and the spirits of parents and children , of young and old were left to wander , unwept . There was no space in the burial mounds , and not enough wood for the fires . ’
65506	65562	65504	65504	I	0	‘ O Jupiter , if they do not lie when they say that you were held in Aegina ’s embrace , she , the daughter of Asopus , and if you are not ashamed , mighty father , to have fathered me , give me back my people or bury me too in their tomb . ’
65580	65610	65578	65578	I	0	‘ I interpret this to be an omen , and that you give me it as a pledge , and may these accordingly be auspicious tokens of your purpose . ’
65670	65690	65668	65668	I	0	‘ Best of fathers , give me as many citizens as this and fill the city ’s empty walls . ’
65920	65940	65910	65910	Telamon	973	‘ Father , come out and see , something greater than you could hope or believe . Come now ! ’
65995	66078	65974	65974	I	0	’ empty fields . I called them Myrmidons , a name that did not belie each one ’s origin as an ant , μύρμηξ . You have seen their bodies : they still retain the habits they had before , a thrifty , hard - working people , tenacious of achievement , and keeping what they achieve . These men fresh in years and spirit , will follow you to war , as soon as that favourable east wind that brought you here ’
66090	66098	66099	66099	They	3454	‘ has swung round to the south . ’
66259	66329	66257	66257	he	3466	‘ I am knowledgeable about woodland , and hunting wild animals , but I have been wondering for a while what tree that shaft was cut from . If it were ash it would be deep yellow , and if it were cornelian cherry it would be knotted . What it is I am ignorant of , but my eyes have never seen one more beautifully formed for throwing . ’
66336	66377	66330	66334	One of the Athenian brothers	3467	‘ You will marvel at its usefulness more than at its looks . It hits whatever it is aimed at : there is no chance involved , and then it flies back , bloodied , without needing to be retrieved . ’

She was Procris , or if Orithyia ’s name has chanced to fill your ears more loudly , the sister of that Orithyia whom Boreas stole , though if you were to compare the two in looks and manner , Procris was more worth stealing ! Her father Erechtheus brought us together in marriage , and love brought us together too . I was called happy , and I was . But the gods ’

67853	67863	67864	67864	Phocus	975	’ said Phocus . And Cephalus recounted its crime . ‘
68767	69313	68757	68757	her	917	’ The hero , weeping , had told this sorrowful tale , when , behold , Aeacus entered with his two sons , and their newly enlisted men , whom Cephalus then accepted , with all their heavy armour . Now Lucifer dispelling night , and unveiling shining day , the east wind dropped , and rain clouds gathered . The mild south wind , gave Cephalus and the Aeacides safe return , bringing them , more quickly than they expected , to the harbour they steered for , by its favourable action . Meanwhile Minos was laying waste the coast of Megara , and testing his military strength against the city of Alcathoüs , where Nisus ruled , who had a bright lock of purple hair , on the crown of his head , amongst his distinguished grey tresses , that guaranteed the safety of his kingdom . The horns of a new moon had risen six times and the fortunes of war still hung in the balance , so protractedly did Victory hover between the two , on hesitant wings . There was a tower of the king , added to walls of singing stone , where Apollo , Latona ’s son , once rested his golden lyre , and the sound resonated in the rock . In days of peace , Scylla , the daughter of King Nisus , often used to climb up there , and make the stones ring using small pebbles . In wartime also she would often watch the unyielding armed conflicts from there , and now , as the war dragged on , she had come to know the names of the hostile princes , their weapons , horses , armour and Cretan quivers . Above all she came to know the face of their leader , Europa ’s son , more than was fitting . If he covered his head with a plumed helmet , she thought him handsome in a helmet . If he carried his shining bronze shield , a shield became him well . When he hurled his heavy spear , with taut limbs , the girl admired his strength combined with skill . When he bent the broad arc of his bow , with a flight notched in it , she swore that it was Phoebus Apollo , standing there , with his arrow ready . But when he exposed his face , free of the bronze , and when , clothed in purple , he took to horseback , his white horse conspicuous with its embroidered trappings , and he controlled its foaming bit , Nisus ’s daughter was scarcely in control of herself , scarcely in a rational frame of mind . Happy the spear he held , she said , and happy the reins he lifted in his hand . Her impulse was to run , though only a girl , if it had been allowed , through the enemy lines ; her impulse was to throw herself from the top of the tower into the Cretan camp , to open the bronze gates to their army , or anything else Minos might wish . As she sat gazing at the white tents of the Dictaean king , she said ‘
69835	69949	69958	69958	Scylla	988	’ As she was speaking , Night , most powerful healer of our cares , darkened , and , with the shadows , her boldness grew . The first hours of quiet had come , when sleep soothes hearts that the day ’s anxieties have wearied : the daughter steals silently into her father ’s room , and ( alas , the evil ! ) robs him of the fateful lock of hair . Through the middle of the enemy camp she goes ( so certain of her worth to them ) with the impious prize she has gained , straight to the king : who is startled by her speech to him . ‘
70020	70051	70053	70054	the gods	1538	’ And she held out her gift in her sinful hand . Minos recoiled from what she offered him , and shaken by the thought of this unnatural act , answered ‘
70105	70200	70203	70203	you	3593	’ He spoke : and after establishing laws for his defeated enemies , this most just of legislators , ordered the cables to be loosed from his fleet , and the oars of the bronze - beaked ships to be set in motion . When Scylla saw that the ships were drawing away over the sea , and that their master had refused her the reward for her wickedness , exhausting prayer , she succumbed to violent anger , and , her hair streaming , shouted in her fury , stretching our her hands . ‘
70671	70802	70651	70651	I	0	’ She had scarcely finished speaking when she leapt into the sea , and swam after the fleet , her passion lending her strength , and clung to the Cretan boat . Her father , who had been newly changed into a sea eagle , soaring through the air on tawny wings , saw her , and dived towards her , as she clung there , to tear at her with his hooked beak . In fear she let go of the sternpost , but as she fell the light breeze seemed to hold her , not letting her touch the water . Feathers spring from her arms : changed into a bird , the rock dove , with its red legs and purple throat , she is called Ciris , ‘
70804	71243	71244	71244	He	3621	’ , and acquired that name from her cutting of the lock of hair . When Minos reached Cretan soil he paid his dues to Jove , with the sacrifice of a hundred bulls , and hung up his war trophies to adorn the palace . The scandal concerning his family grew , and the queen ’s unnatural adultery was evident from the birth of a strange hybrid monster . Minos resolved to remove this shame , the Minotaur , from his house , and hide it away in a labyrinth with blind passageways . Daedalus , celebrated for his skill in architecture , laid out the design , and confused the clues to direction , and led the eye into a tortuous maze , by the windings of alternating paths . No differently from the way in which the watery Maeander deludes the sight , flowing backwards and forwards in its changeable course , through the meadows of Phrygia , facing the running waves advancing to meet it , now directing its uncertain waters towards its source , now towards the open sea : so Daedalus made the endless pathways of the maze , and was scarcely able to recover the entrance himself : the building was as deceptive as that . In there , Minos walled up the twin form of bull and man , and twice nourished it on Athenian blood , but the third repetition of the nine - year tribute by lot , caused the monster ’s downfall . When , through the help of the virgin princess , Ariadne , by rewinding the thread , Theseus , son of Aegeus , won his way back to the elusive threshold , that no one had previously regained , he immediately set sail for Dia , stealing the daughter of Minos away with him , then cruelly abandoned his companion on that shore . Deserted and weeping bitterly , as she was , Bacchus - Liber brought her help and comfort . So that she might shine among the eternal stars , he took the crown from her forehead , and set it in the sky . It soared through the rarefied air , and as it soared its jewels changed to bright fires , and took their place , retaining the appearance of a crown , as the Corona Borealis , between the kneeling Hercules and the head of the serpent that Ophiuchus holds . Meanwhile Daedalus , hating Crete , and his long exile , and filled with a desire to stand on his native soil , was imprisoned by the waves . ‘
71253	71256	71244	71244	He	3621	’ he said ‘
71282	71491	71493	71493	me	0	’ . So saying he applied his thought to new invention and altered the natural order of things . He laid down lines of feathers , beginning with the smallest , following shorter with longer ones , so you might think they had grown like that , on a slant . In this way , long ago , the rustic pan - pipes were graduated , with lengthening reeds . Then he fastened them together with thread at the middle , and bees’-wax at the base , and , when he had arranged them , he flexed each one into a gentle curve , so that they imitated real bird ’s wings . His son , Icarus , stood next to him , and , not realising that he was handling things that would endanger him , caught laughingly at the down that blew in the passing breeze , and softened the yellow bees’-wax with his thumb , and , in his play , hindered his father ’s marvellous work . When he had put the last touches to what he had begun , the artificer balanced his own body between the two wings and hovered in the moving air . He instructed the boy as well , saying ‘
71572	71883	71884	71884	Icarus	994	’ At the same time as he laid down the rules of flight , he fitted the newly created wings on the boy ’s shoulders . While he worked and issued his warnings the ageing man ’s cheeks were wet with tears : the father ’s hands trembled . He gave a never to be repeated kiss to his son , and lifting upwards on his wings , flew ahead , anxious for his companion , like a bird , leading her fledglings out of a nest above , into the empty air . He urged the boy to follow , and showed him the dangerous art of flying , moving his own wings , and then looking back at his son . Some angler catching fish with a quivering rod , or a shepherd leaning on his crook , or a ploughman resting on the handles of his plough , saw them , perhaps , and stood there amazed , believing them to be gods able to travel the sky . And now Samos , sacred to Juno , lay ahead to the left ( Delos and Paros were behind them ) , Lebinthos , and Calymne , rich in honey , to the right , when the boy began to delight in his daring flight , and abandoning his guide , drawn by desire for the heavens , soared higher . His nearness to the devouring sun softened the fragrant wax that held the wings : and the wax melted : he flailed with bare arms , but losing his oar - like wings , could not ride the air . Even as his mouth was crying his father ’s name , it vanished into the dark blue sea , the Icarian Sea , called after him . The unhappy father , now no longer a father , shouted ‘
71901	71902	71903	71903	Icarus	994	’ ‘
71904	72436	71884	71884	Icarus	994	’ he called again . Then he caught sight of the feathers on the waves , and cursed his inventions . He laid the body to rest , in a tomb , and the island was named Icaria after his buried child . As he was consigning his unfortunate son to the grave , a noisy partridge poked its head out from a muddy ditch , and , called , cackling joyfully , with whirring wings . It was the only one of its kind , not seen in previous years , and only recently made a bird , as a lasting reproach to you , Daedalus . Your sister , Perdix , oblivious to the fates , sent you her son , Talus , to be taught : twelve years old , his mind ready for knowledge . Indeed , the child , studying the spine of a fish , took it as a model , and cut continuous teeth out of sharp metal , inventing the use of the saw . He was also the first to pivot two iron arms on a pin , so that , with the arms at a set distance , one part could be fixed , and the other sweep out a circle . Daedalus was jealous , and hurled the boy headlong from Minerva ’s sacred citadel , claiming that he had fallen . But Pallas Minerva , who favours those with quick minds , caught him , and turned him into the partridge , masking him with feathers in mid - air . His inborn energy was transferred to swift wings and feet , and he kept his mother ’s name , Perdix , from before . But the bird does not perch above the ground , and does not make its nest on branches or on high points , but flies low on whirring wings over the soil , and lays its eggs in a sheltered place . Now Sicily , the land of Mount Etna , held the weary Daedalus , and King Cocalus , regarded as peaceable , had taken up arms , against Minos , in defence of the suppliant : and thanks to Theseus , Athens now had ceased to pay Crete the sorrowful levy . The temple was wreathed with flowers , and the Athenians called out to warlike Minerva , to Jupiter and to the other gods , honouring them with gifts , and the blood of sacrificial offerings , and the contents of their incense - boxes . Far - wandering fame had spread the name of Theseus through all the cities of the Argolis , and the peoples inhabiting wealthy Achaia begged for his help in their great trouble , and Calydon , as a suppliant , despite having Meleager , asked his help , with anxious prayers . The reason for their asking was a wild boar , servant and avenging power of Diana ’s aggression . King Oeneus of Calydon , they say , made offerings , from the successful harvests of a full year , of the first fruits of the crops to Ceres , of wine to Bacchus , ‘
72441	72503	72504	72504	I	0	’ , of libations of flowing oil , from the olives , to golden Minerva . The honour they desire was paid to all the gods , beginning with the rural deities : only the daughter of Latona ’s altar was passed by : neglected , it is said , and left without its incense . Anger even touches the gods . ‘
72512	72515	73125	73125	she	3629	’ she cried ‘
72534	73117	72528	72528	I	0	’ And the goddess , spurned , sent an avenging wild boar , over the Aetolian fields : grassy Epirus had none greater than it , and those of the island of Sicily were smaller . Its eyes glowed with bloodshot fire : its neck was stiff with bristles , and the hairs , on its hide , bristled stiffly like spear - shafts : just as a palisade stands , so the hairs stood like tall spears . Hot foam flecked the broad shoulders , from its hoarse grunting . Its tusks were the size of an Indian elephant ’s : lightning came from its mouth : and the leaves were scorched , by its breath . Now it trampled the young shoots of the growing crops , now cut short the ripeness , longed - for by the mournful farmer , and scythed down the corn in ear . The granaries and threshing floors waited for the promised harvest in vain . Heavy clusters of grapes were brought down along with the trailing vines , and fruit and branch of the evergreen olives . It rages among the cattle too . Neither the herdsmen and dogs , nor their own fierce bulls can defend the herds . The people scatter , and only count themselves safe behind city walls . At last Meleager and a handpicked group of men gather , longing for glory : Castor and Polydeuces , the Dioscuri , twin sons of Tyndareus and Leda , one son famous for boxing , the other for horsemanship : Jason who built the first ship : Theseus and Pirithoüs , fortunate in friendship : Plexippus and Toxeus , the two sons of Thestius , uncles of Meleager : Lynceus and swift Idas , sons of Aphareus : Caeneus , once a woman : warlike Leucippus : Acastus , famed for his javelin : Hippothoüs : Dryas : Phoenix , Amyntor ’s son : Eurytus and Cleatus , the sons of Actor : and Phyleus , sent by Elis . Telamon was there , and Peleus , father of the great Achilles : with Admetus , the son of Pheres , and Iolaüs from Boeotia were Eurytion , energetic in action , and Echion unbeaten at running : and Lelex from Locria , Panopeus , Hyleus , and daring Hippasus : Nestor , still in the prime of life : and those that Hippocoön sent , with Enaesimus , from ancient Amyclae : Laërtes , Penelope ’s father - in - law with Ancaeus of Arcady : Mopsus , the shrewd son of Ampyx : and Amphiaraüs , son of Oecleus , not yet betrayed by his wife , Eriphyle . And Atalanta , the warrior girl of Tegea , the glory of Arcadia ’s woods , with a polished brooch clasping the neck of her garment , and her hair simply done , caught in a single knot . An ivory quiver , holding her arrows , that rattled as she moved , hung from her left shoulder , and her left hand held the bow . So she was dressed : as for her face , you might truly say , the virgin was there , in a boy , and a boy , in the girl . The moment he saw her , that moment , Meleager , the hero of Calydon , desired her , though the gods might refuse it , devoured by secret fires . ‘
73130	73429	73430	73430	Phoebus	519	’ he said . Neither time nor honour allowed him further words : the greater task of the greater conflict urged him on . A forest thick with trees , that had never been cut , at any time , began above the plain , and overlooked the sloping fields . When the heroes reached it , some spread out hunting nets , others loosed the dogs from their leashes , while others again followed the deeply - marked trail , keen to discover their quarry . There was a deep valley that collected streams of rainwater , falling near it : and it held , in its depths , pliant willows , smooth sedges , and marsh grasses , and osiers and tall bulrushes , above the lowly reeds . The boar was roused from there , and made a violent charge into the midst of its enemies , like lightning forced from colliding clouds . Trees were flattened by its impact , and the woods crashed as it drove into them . The warriors shouted , and held their spears spread outward , with firm hands , waving their broad blades . The boar rushed them , scattering the dogs , as they obstructed it in its fury , putting the baying pack to flight with sidelong swipes of its tusks . The first spear , delivered by Echion ’s arm , was ineffectual , and gave the trunk of a maple a glancing blow . The next , if it had not been thrown with too great a force , aimed at the creature ’s back , seemed certain to stick there , but the throw was too long . Jason of Pagasae hurled the spear . Then Mopsus , son of Ampyx , cried out ‘
73454	73925	73926	73926	You	3630	’ The god did what he could , to fulfil the prayer : the boar was hit , but without being wounded . Diana had stolen the iron point of the javelin , in flight : what arrived was the wooden shaft without its tip . The wild beast ’s anger was aroused , and blazed out no more gently than lightning . Flame burned in its eyes , and was breathed from its chest . With dangerous and unerring momentum , the boar hurtled towards the young men , as a stone flies from a taut catapult , aimed at walls or battlements full of soldiers . Hippalmus and Pelagon , holding the right flank , were knocked to the ground : their friends caught them up as they lay there . But Enaesimus , son of Hippocoön , did not escape the fatal blow : about to turn his back , in alarm , he sank down , as the sinews of his knee gave way . And King Nestor of Pylos , might perhaps have perished before his time at Troy , but , using the leverage of his firmly planted spear , he vaulted into a tree , that stood close by , and looked down , from a place of safety , on the quarry he had escaped . The fierce creature , sharpening its tusks on the trunk of an oak , threatened them with destruction , and confident in its freshly renewed weapons , ripped open mighty Hippasus ’s thigh , with one curving edge . But now the Gemini , Castor and Pollux , not yet changed into stars in the sky , twin brothers , conspicuous among the rest , both rode up , on horses whiter than snow , and brandishing their javelins in the air as one , hurled them , the points quivering with the motion . They would have wounded the beast , had not the bristling creature retreated into the dense woods where no horse or spear could penetrate . Telamon did follow , and careless where he was placing his feet , in his enthusiasm , fell flat on the ground , tripping over the root of a tree . While Peleus was lifting him , the girl from Tegea strung a swift arrow , and sent it speeding from the curved bow . The shaft just grazed the top of the boar ’s back , and fixing itself below one ear , reddened the bristles with a thin stream of blood . Nor did she praise her own successful shot more than Meleager did . He was supposed to have been the first to see the blood , and first , having seen it , to point it out to his friends , saying : ‘
73937	73997	73926	73926	You	3630	’ The warriors flushed with their shame , urged each other on , gaining courage from their clamour , hurling their spears without sense of order . The jostling spoilt their throw , and prevented the strike they intended . Then Ancaeus of Arcady , with his twin - headed axe , rushing to meet his fate , cried : ‘
74048	74169	74032	74032	her	3634	’ Swollen with pride , like this , with boastful words , he spoke , and , lifting the double axe in both hands , he stood on tiptoe , poised for the downward blow . The boar anticipated this daring enemy , and struck at the upper groin , the quickest way to kill , with his twin tusks . Ancaeus collapsed , and the slippery mass of his inner organs fell away in a pool of blood : the ground was soaked with the red fluid . Then Pirithoüs , son of Ixion , went against the quarry , brandishing his hunting - spear in his strong right - hand . Theseus , Aegeus ’s son , called out ‘
74209	74447	74200	74200	Ancaeus	1029	’ He spoke , and threw his heavy spear , of cornelian cherry - wood , with its bronze blade . Though well aimed and capable of reaching its mark , it was deflected by the leafy branch of an oak . Jason , Aeson ’s son , hurled his javelin , which swerved by accident , and the fatal throw transfixing the flanks of an innocent hound , pinned it to the ground . But Meleager ’s hand made the difference , and of the two spears he threw , though one stuck in the earth , the other fixed itself in the boar ’s back . Now , while it raged , and twisted its body round , and spouted out hissing foam and fresh blood , the author of its wound came at it , pricked his quarry to fury , and buried his shining hunting - spear in his enemy ’s shoulder . Then the companions give proof of their joy , shouting , and crowding around him to grasp his hand in theirs . They gaze , wonderingly , at the huge creature covering so much of the earth it lies on , and still think it unsafe to touch the beast , but nevertheless each wets his spear in its blood . Meleager , himself , pressed his foot down on the head of the deadly creature , and said to Atalanta ‘
74470	74544	74200	74200	Ancaeus	1029	’ Then he gave her the spoils , the hide bristling with hair , and the head remarkable for its magnificent tusks . She delighted in the giver no less than the gift , but the others were envious , and a murmur ran through the whole company . Of these , Plexippus , and Toxeus , the sons of Thestius , Meleager ’s uncles , stretching their arms out , shouted loudly : ‘
74590	74630	74631	74631	Learn	1041	’ And they took the gifts away from her , and denied him the right to give them . The descendant of Mars could not bear this , and bursting with anger , gnashing his teeth , he said : ‘
74647	74838	74839	74839	We	3644	’ , and plunged his iron point into Plexippus ’s chest , he expecting nothing of that kind . Meleager gave Toxeus , who stood in doubt , wanting to avenge his brother , but fearing his brother ’s fate , scant time for doubt , and while his spear was still warm from the first brother ’s murder , he warmed it again with the second brother ’s blood . Althaea was carrying thanksgiving offerings , for her son Meleager ’s victory , to the temple of the gods , when she saw them bringing back her dead brothers . She filled the city with the clamour of wailing , beat her breasts , and replaced her golden robes with black . But when she heard who the murderer was , she forgot her mourning , and her longing changed from tears to revenge . There was a piece of wood that the Three Sisters placed in the fire , when Althaea , the daughter of Thestius , was in the throes of childbirth . As they spun the threads of fate firmly under their thumbs , they said : ‘
74859	75126	74839	74839	We	3644	’ When the goddesses vanished , after speaking the prophecy , the mother snatched the burning branch from the fire , and doused it with water . It had long been hidden away in the depths of the inner rooms , and preserved , had preserved your years , youth . Your mother now brought it out , and called for pinewood and kindling : and , once that was in position , she lit the hostile flames . Then she tried , four times , to throw the brand in the fire , and four times , held back . The mother fought the sister in her , and the two tugged at the one heart . Often her cheeks grew pale at imminent wickedness . Often fierce anger filled her eyes with blood . One moment she seemed like someone threatening some cruelty : the next you would think her full of compassion . When her heart ’s fierce passion dried up her tears , the tears welled up again . As a ship , that the wind , and the tide opposing the wind , both seize , feels the twin forces and obeys the two , uncertainly , so the daughter of Thestius , was swayed by her emotions , and her anger alternately calmed , and then flared again . However , the sister in her begins to outweigh the mother , and to appease the shades of her own blood , with blood , she escapes guilt by incurring it . Now , as the baleful fire strengthens , she cries ‘
75138	75165	75166	75166	Eumenides	911	’ As she held the fatal brand in her deadly hand , and stood , wretched woman , in front of the funeral altars , she said ‘
75532	75555	75556	75556	mother	1809	’ wounds are before my eyes and the image of all that blood : and now heart ’s love , and the word ‘
75557	75593	75594	75594	She	3667	’ move me . Woe to me ! Evil is in your victory , my brothers : but victory you shall have : only let me follow you , and the comfort I bring you ! ’
76103	76114	76115	76118	the river - god	2896	‘ Come under my roof , famous scion of Cecrops , ’
76121	76183	76115	76118	the river - god	2896	‘ and do not commit yourself to my devouring waters . They are liable to carry solid tree - trunks along , in their roaring , and roll great boulders over on their sides . I have seen whole byres , near the bank , swept away , with all their livestock : and neither the cattle ’s strength nor the horses ’
76236	76245	76246	76246	I	0	’ Aegeus ’s son nodded , and replied : ‘
76260	76423	76258	76258	Acheloüs	1048	’ And so he did . He entered the dark building , made of spongy pumice , and rough tufa . The floor was moist with soft moss , and the ceiling banded with freshwater mussel and oyster shells . Now Hyperion , the sun , had measured out two thirds of his path of light , when Theseus and his companions of the hunt seated themselves on couches . Here was Pirithoüs , Ixion ’s son , and there , Lelex , Troezen ’s hero , his temples already streaked with thinning grey hair , and there were others whom the Acarnanian river - god , greatly delighted to have such a guest , judged worthy of equal honour . Quickly the barefoot nymphs set out dishes of food on the nearby tables , and when they had been cleared again , poured wine in jewelled cups . Then the greatest of heroes looking out over the waters below , asked : ‘
76429	76438	76258	76258	Acheloüs	1048	’ ( He pointed with his finger . ) ‘
76455	76461	76258	76258	Acheloüs	1048	’ The river - god replied ‘
76701	76752	76698	76698	I	0	‘ O God of the Trident , to whom rule over the restless waves , closest to earth , fell by lot , give your aid I beg , and grant a place to one whom a father ’s anger drowns , or allow her to be that place herself ! ’
76819	76853	76854	76855	The others	1756	‘ These are fictions you tell of , Acheloüs , and you credit the gods with too much power , if you think they can give and take away the forms of things . ’
76878	77561	76865	76865	Lelex	1023	‘ The power of the gods is great and knows no limit , and whatever heaven decrees comes to pass . To help convince you , in the hills of Phrygia , an oak and a lime tree stand side by side , surrounded by a low wall . I have seen the place , since Pittheus , king of Troezen , sent me into that country , where his father Pelops once ruled . There is a swamp not far from there , once habitable land but now the haunt of diving - birds and marsh - loving coots . Jupiter went there , disguised as a mortal , and Mercury , the descendant of Atlas , setting aside his wings , went with his father , carrying the caduceus . A thousand houses they approached , looking for a place to rest : a thousand houses were locked and bolted . But one received them : it was humble it is true , roofed with reeds and stems from the marsh , but godly Baucis and the equally aged Philemon , had been wedded in that cottage in their younger years , and there had grown old together . They made light of poverty by acknowledging it , and bearing it without discontent of mind . It was no matter if you asked for owner or servant there : those two were the whole household : they gave orders and carried them out equally . So when the gods from heaven met the humble household gods , and stooping down , passed the low doorway , the old man pulled out a bench , and requested them to rest their limbs , while over the bench Baucis threw a rough blanket . Then she raked over the warm ashes in the hearth , and brought yesterday ’s fire to life , feeding it with leaves and dried bark , nursing the flames with her aged breath . She pulled down finely divided twigs and dry stems from the roof , and , breaking them further , pushed them under a small bronze pot . Next she stripped the leaves from vegetables that her husband had gathered from his well - watered garden . He used a two - pronged stick to lift down a wretched - looking chine of meat , hanging from a blackened beam , and , cutting a meagre piece from the carefully saved chine , put what had been cut , to seethe , in boiling water . In the meantime they made conversation to pass the time , and prevent their guests being conscious of the delay . There was a beech wood tub , suspended by its handle from a crude peg : this had been filled with warm water , and allowed their visitors to refresh their limbs . In the middle of the floor there was a mattress of soft sedges . Placed on a frame and legs of willow it made a couch . They covered it with cloths , that they only used to bring out for the times of sacred festivals , but even these were old and worn , not unworthy of the couch . The gods were seated . The old woman , her skirts tucked up , her hands trembling , placed a table there , but a table with one of the three legs unequal : a piece of broken pot made them equal . Pushed underneath , it countered the slope , and she wiped the level surface with fresh mint . On it she put the black and green olives that belong to pure Minerva , and the cornelian cherries of autumn , preserved in wine lees ; radishes and endives ; a lump of cheese ; and lightly roasted eggs , untouched by the hot ashes ; all in clay dishes . After this she set out a carved mixing bowl for wine , just as costly , with cups made of beech wood , hollowed out , and lined with yellow bees ’
77667	77668	77670	77672	the old couple	3722	’ ‘
77727	77926	77712	77712	Baucis	1052	’ forgiveness for the meal , and their un - preparedness . They had a goose , the guard for their tiny cottage : as hosts they prepared to sacrifice it for their divine guests . But , quick - winged , it wore the old people out and , for a long time , escaped them , at last appearing to take refuge with the gods themselves . Then the heaven - born ones told them not to kill it . “ We are gods , ” they said , “ and this neighbourhood will receive just punishment for its impiety , but to you we grant exemption from that evil . Just leave your house , and accompany our steps , as we climb that steep mountainside together . ” They both obeyed , and leaning on their sticks to ease their climb , they set foot on the long slope . When they were as far from the summit as a bowshot might carry , they looked back , and saw everywhere else vanished in the swamp : only their own roof was visible . And while they stood amazed at this , mourning their neighbours ’
78085	78281	78282	78282	Lelex	1023	’ assurance followed the prayer . They had charge of the temple while they lived : and when they were released by old age , and by the years , as they chanced to be standing by the sacred steps , discussing the subject of their deaths , Baucis saw Philemon put out leaves , and old Philemon saw Baucis put out leaves , and as the tops of the trees grew over their two faces , they exchanged words , while they still could , saying , in the same breath : “ Farewell , O dear companion ” , as , in the same breath , the bark covered them , concealing their mouths . The people of Bithynia still show the neighbouring trees there , that sprang from their two bodies . Trustworthy old men related these things to me ( there was no reason why they should wish to lie ) . For my part , I saw garlands hanging from the branches , and placing fresh ones there said : “ Let those who love the gods become gods : let those who have honoured them , be honoured . ” ’
78330	78940	78314	78314	Acheloüs	1048	‘ Hero , there are those who , once changed in form , retain that transformation : there are others who are allowed to transmute into many shapes : you , for instance , Proteus , inhabitant of the earth - encircling sea . A moment ago they saw you as a young man , then as a lion : now as a raging boar , then as a serpent , they fear to touch : and , in a moment , horns revealed you as a bull . Often you might have appeared as a stone , often , also , as a tree : sometimes , you formed the likeness of running water , and became a river : sometimes fire , water ’s opposite . Mestra , Erysichthon ’s daughter , the wife of Autolycus , had no less power . Her father was a man scornful of the gods , who burnt no incense on their altars . Erysichthon , it is said , once violated the grove of Ceres with an axe , and desecrated the ancient woods with iron . Within them stood a great oak , massive with the years , a sacred grove in itself : strands of wool , wreaths of flowers and votive tablets surrounded it , evidence of prayers granted . Often beneath it the Dryads held their festive dances : often , also , linking hands , in line , they circled its trunk ’s circumference , its massive girth measuring fifteen arm’s - lengths round . The other trees were not less far below it than the grass was far below all of them . Triopas ’s son would not hold back the blade , even for those reasons , commanding his servants to fell the sacred oak . When he saw them hesitating at the order , the wretched man snatched the axe from one of them , saying : “ Though this be , itself , the goddess , not just what the goddess loves , now its leafy crown will meet the earth . ” As he spoke , while he balanced the blade , for the slanting stroke , Ceres ’s oak - tree trembled all over and gave a sigh , and at the same time its acorns and its leaves began to whiten , and its long branches grew pale . And , when his impious hand made a gash in the trunk , blood poured out of its damaged bark , like the crimson tide from its severed neck , when the mighty bull falls , in sacrifice , before the altar . All stood astonished , and one of them tried bravely to prevent the evil , and hinder the barbarous double - edged weapon . But the Thessalian glared at him , saying : “ Here ’s the prize for your pious thought ! ” and swinging his blade at the man not the tree , struck his head from his trunk . He was hewing at the oak - tree repeatedly , when the sound of a voice came from inside the oak , chanting these words : “ I am a nymph , most dear to Ceres , under the surface of this wood , who prophesy to you , as I die , that punishment will follow blood : out of my ruin , the only good ” . But he pursued his course of evil , and at last , weakened by innumerable blows , and dragged down by ropes , the tree fell , its weight cutting a swathe through the wood . ’
78941	79207	78314	78314	Acheloüs	1048	‘ All her sister Dryads , mourning and dressed in black , horrified at the forest ’s loss and their own , went to Ceres , and begged her to punish Erysichthon . She assented , and , with a motion of her head , that most beautiful of goddesses stirred the fields , heavy with ripened grain . She devised a punishment to rouse men ’s pity , if his actions had deserved any pity : to torment him with baleful Hunger . But since the goddess herself could not approach her ( for fate does not allow Famine and Ceres to meet ) she called for one of the mountain spirits , an Oread of wild places , and said to her : “ There is a place at the furthest bounds of icy Scythia , with sombre , sterile ground , a land without crops or trees . Torpid Cold inhabits it , Fear and Trembling and barren Hunger . Order Famine to immure herself in the belly of that sacrilegious wretch , and let no plenty oust her , and let her overcome me in any trial of strength . So that the length of the journey does not worry you , take my chariot , take my winged dragons , and govern their bridles on high . ” And she gave her the reins . The nymph came to Scythia , carried through the air , in the chariot she was given . On the summit of a frozen mountain chain ( they call the Caucasus ) she loosed the dragons ’
79735	79736	79729	79729	he	1057	’ ‘
80216	80217	80212	80212	his	6244	’ ‘
80229	80233	80221	80221	I	0	’ said Acheloüs , ‘
80315	80366	80367	80367	You	0	’ His words were followed by a sigh . Theseus , the hero , reputed son of Neptune , asked Acheloüs why he had sighed , and the reason for his damaged forehead : to which the Calydonian river - god , his uncut hair wreathed with reeds , replied : ‘
81810	81899	81798	81798	Nessus	1064	‘ With my help , Alcides , ” he said , “ she will be set down on the far bank . Use your strength to swim ! ” The Theban handed over the Calydonian girl , she , pale with fear , frightened of the river and of the centaur himself . Straight away , weighed down as he was by his quiver and his lion ’s skin - he had thrown his club and his curved bow across to the other bank – the hero said : ‘
81912	81974	81798	81798	Nessus	1064	’ He did not hesitate , and did not search for where the river was calmest , scorning to claim the water ’s allegiance . He had gained the bank , and was picking up the bow he had thrown , when he heard his wife ’s voice , and shouted to Nessus , who was preparing to betray his trust : ‘
82069	82146	82147	82147	I	0	’ He made good his last words with his actions , shooting the arrow he fired , across , at the fleeing back . The barbed tip jutted from the centaur ’s chest . When the shaft was pulled out , blood , mixed with the deadly arrow - poison of the Lernean Hydra , gushed out simultaneously from the entry and exit wounds . Nessus trapped this , and murmured , to himself of course : ‘
82153	82336	82147	82147	I	0	’ and gave his tunic soaked with warm blood to Deianira , whom he had abducted , presenting it to her as if it were a gift for reviving a waning love . A long space of intervening time passed by , and the tales of mighty Hercules had filled the world , and overcome his stepmother ’s hatred . As the victor at Oechalia , in Euboea ( where he had avenged an insult offered him by King Eurytus ) he was preparing to sacrifice to Jupiter at Cenaeum , when loquacious Rumour , who loves to add lies to fact , and expands from the tiniest truth by her falsehoods , brought her tale on ahead , to your ears , Deianira . She claimed that Hercules , reputed son of Amphitryon , was filled with passion for Iole , daughter of Eurytus . The loving wife believes it , and terrified at first by the rumour of this new affair , she indulges in tears , and the poor girl vents her misery in weeping . But she soon says ‘
82453	82776	82777	82777	Juno	877	’ Her thought traced various courses . Of all of them she preferred that of sending the shirt , imbued with Nessus ’s blood , to restore her husband ’s waning love . Unwittingly , she entrusted what became her future grief , to the servant , Lichas , he not knowing what he had been entrusted with : and the unfortunate woman , ordered him , with persuasive words , to give the present to her husband . Hercules , the hero , took it , without a thought , and put on the shirt of Nessus , soaked in the poison of the Lernean Hydra . He was making offerings of incense and reciting prayers over the first flames , and pouring a libation bowl of wine on to the marble altar . The power of the venom , warmed and released by the flames , dissolved , dispersing widely through the limbs of Hercules . With his usual courage , he repressed his groans while he could . When his strength to endure the venom was exhausted , he overturned the altar , and filled woody Oeta with his shouts . He tries at once to tear off the fatal clothing : where it is pulled away , it pulls skin away with it , and , revolting to tell , it either sticks to the limbs from which he tries in vain to remove it , or reveals the lacerated limbs and his massive bones . His blood itself hisses and boils , with the virulence of the poison , like incandescent metal , dipped in a cold pool . There is no end to it : the consuming fires suck at the air in his chest : dark sweat pours from his whole body : his scorched sinews crackle . His marrow liquefying with the secret corruption , he raises his hands to the heavens , crying : ‘
83179	83291	83295	83295	you	3878	’ So saying he roamed , in his illness , over the heights of Oeta , as a bull carries around a hunting spear embedded in its body , though the hunter who threw it has long gone . Picture him there , in the mountains , in his anger , often groaning , often shouting out , often attempting , again and again , to rid himself of the last of the garment , overturning trees , or stretching his arms out to his native skies . Then he caught sight of the terrified Lichas , cowering in a hollow of the cliff , and pain concentrated all his fury . ‘
83299	83303	83295	83295	you	3878	’ he said , ‘
83320	83690	83312	83312	you	3878	’ The man trembled , grew pale with fear , and , timidly , made excuses . While he was speaking , and trying to clasp the hero ’s knees , Alcides seized him , and , swinging him round three or four times , hurled him , more violently than a catapult bolt , into the Euboean waters . Hanging in the air , he hardened with the wind . As rain freezes in the icy blasts and becomes snow ; whirling snowflakes bind together in a soft mass ; and they , in turn , accumulate as a body of solid hailstones : so he , the ancient tradition says , flung by strong arms through the void , bloodless with fright , and devoid of moisture , turned to hard flint . Now , in the Euboean Gulf , a low rock rises out of the depths , and keeps the semblance of a human shape . This sailors are afraid to set foot on , as though it could sense them , and they call it , Lichas . But you , famous son of Jove , felled the trees that grew on steep Oeta , and made a funeral pyre , and commanded Philoctetes , son of Poeas , who supplied the flame that was plunged into it , to take your bow , your ample quiver , and the arrows , that were fated to see , once more , the kingdom of Troy ( as they did when you rescued Hesione . ) As the mass caught light from the eager fire , you spread the Nemean Lion ’s pelt on the summit of the pile of logs , and lay down , your neck resting on your club , and with an aspect no different from that of a guest , reclining amongst the full wine cups , crowned with garlands . Now the fierce flames , spreading on every side , were crackling loudly , and licking at his body , he unconcerned and scornful of them . The gods were fearful for earth ’s champion . Saturnian Jupiter spoke to them , gladly , since he understood their feelings . ‘
83903	84185	83885	83885	she	3891	’ The gods agreed . Juno , also , appeared to accept the rest of his words with compliance , but not the last ones , upset that she was being censored . Meanwhile , Mulciber had consumed whatever the flames could destroy , and no recognisable form of Hercules remained , no semblance of what came to him from his mother : he only retained his inheritance from Jove . As a snake enjoys its newness , sloughing old age with its skin , gleaming with fresh scales ; so , when the Tirynthian hero had shed his mortal body , he became his better part , beginning to appear greater , and more to be revered , in his high majesty . The all - powerful father of the gods carrying him upwards , in his four - horse chariot , through the substance - less clouds , set him among the shining stars . Atlas felt the weight of the new constellation . But even now the anger of Eurystheus , son of Sthenelus , was not appeased , and he pursued his unyielding hatred of the father through the children . Argive Alcmena , troubled by endless cares , had Iole , as one to whom she could confide an old woman ’s miseries , to whom she could relate her son ’s labours , known to all the world , and her own misfortunes . At Hercules request , Hyllus , his son by Deianira , had taken Iole to his marriage - bed , and his heart , and had planted a child of that noble race in her womb . Alcmena said to her : ‘
84565	84590	84541	84541	she	850	‘ Whoever you are , congratulate the mistress . Alcmena of Argolis is eased , and the prayers to aid childbirth have been answered . ’
84733	84767	84768	84768	Mother	916	’ She finished speaking , and sighed , her feelings stirred by the memory of her former servant . While she grieved , her daughter - in - law , Iole , said : ‘
85461	85470	85452	85452	him	3944	‘ My mother is revealed in this tree . ’
85648	85772	85773	85773	Thebes	693	’ While Eurytus ’s daughter was relating this marvellous happening , and Alcmena was wiping away Iole ’s tears ( still weeping herself ) a wonderful thing suspended all sadness . There , on the steep threshold , stood Iolaüs , Hercules ’s nephew and companion , alive again , with the look of his early years , a hint of down on his cheeks , almost , again , a child . Overwhelmed by the prayers of her husband , Hercules , Juno ’s daughter , Hebe , had granted him this gift . When she was about to swear that , after this , she would never allow any further such favour , Themis would not allow it . She prophesied . ‘
86020	86161	86165	86165	you	3970	’ When Themis spoke these words , out of her prophetic mouth , prescient of what was to come , the gods complained in various mutterings , and there was a murmur as to why they were not able to grant the same gift to other mortals . Aurora , daughter of the Titan Pallas , lamented the old age of her husband , Tithonus . Gentle Ceres lamented the greying hair of her former lover Iasion . Mulciber demanded another lifetime for his son , Erichthonius : and Venus , also , touched by fears for the future , wanted to bargain for the renewal of her lover Anchises ’s years . Each god had someone whose cause they supported : and the troublesome mutiny , over their favourites , grew , until Jupiter opened his mouth and said : ‘
86295	86750	86291	86291	he	965	’ Jupiter ’s words swayed the gods : and no one could sustain their objection when they saw Rhadamanthos , Aeacus and Minos wearied with the years . When he was in his prime , Minos had made great nations tremble at his very name : now he was weak , and feared Miletus , who was proud of his strength and parentage , the son of Phoebus Apollo and the nymph Deione . Though Minos believed Miletus might plot an insurrection , he still did not dare to deny him his home . On your own initiative , Miletus , you left , cutting the waters of the Aegean in your swift ship , and built a city on the soil of Asia , that still carries its founder ’s name . There you knew Cyanee , the daughter of Maeander , whose stream so often curves back on itself , when she was following her father ’s winding shores . Twin children were born to her , of outstanding beauty of body , Byblis and her brother Caunus . Byblis , seized by a passion , for her brother , scion of Apollo ; that Byblis serves for a warning to girls , against illicit love . She loved , not as a sister loves a brother , nor as she should . At first , it is true , she did not understand the fires of passion , or think it wrong , to kiss , together , often , or throw her arms round her brother ’s neck . For a long time she was deceived by the misleading likeness to sisterly affection . Gradually the nature of her love went astray , and she came looking for her brother carefully dressed , and over - anxious to look beautiful . If anyone seemed more beautiful to him , she was jealous . But her own feelings were not clear to her , and though she had no inner longing for passion , nevertheless it burned . And now she called him her lord , now she hated the name that made them related , now she wrongly wished him to call her Byblis , rather than sister . While she is awake she still dare not allow her mind its illicit hope , but , deep in peaceful dreams , she often sees what she loves , and is also seen , held in her brother ’s arms , and she blushes , though lost in sleep . When sleep has vanished , she lies there for a long time , recalling , to herself , the imagery of her dream , and at last utters these inner doubts : ‘
87331	87363	87369	87369	me	0	’ This idea pleases her , and this decision overcomes the doubt in her mind . Turning on one side and leaning on her left elbow , she says to herself : ‘
87389	87497	87498	87498	sister	6159	’ And , with a trembling hand , she begins to set down the words she has contemplated . She holds the pen in her right hand , and a blank wax tablet in her left . She begins , then hesitates ; writes and condemns the writing ; scribbles and smoothes it out ; alters , blames and approves ; in turn lays down what she has lifted , and lifts what she has laid down . She does not know what to do , displeased with whatever she is about to do . In her expression , shame is mixed with boldness . She had written ‘
87499	87519	87546	87546	She	4008	’ , but decided to efface the name of sister , and inscribed these words on the corrected tablet : ‘
87958	88022	88023	88023	You	4026	’ Her handwriting filled the wax , with these fruitless words , the last line close to the edge . Immediately she put her seal on the sinful message , dampening it with her tears ( moisture failed her tongue ) , stamping it with her signet ring . Shamefacedly , she called one of her servants , and shyly and coaxingly said : ‘
88034	88121	88031	88033	my .......... brother	4027	’ she added after a long silence . As she let them go , the tablets slipped and fell from her hand . She still sent the letter , troubled by the omen . Finding a suitable time , the messenger went , and delivered the hidden words . Horrified , Maeander ’s grandson , suddenly enraged , hurled away the tablets he had accepted , and partly read , and , scarcely able to keep his hands from the trembling servant ’s throat , cried : ‘
88157	88220	88221	88221	I	0	’ The servant fled in fear , and reported Caunus ’s fierce words , to Byblis . She grew pale , hearing that she had been rejected , and her body shook , gripped by an icy chill . But , when consciousness returned , so did the passion , and , she let out these words , her lips scarcely moving : ‘
88337	88338	88381	88381	him	4029	’ ‘
88816	89374	89379	89379	I	0	’ So she argues , and ( so great is the undecided conflict in her mind ) while she repented of the attempt , she delights in attempting . Going beyond all moderation , and unsuccessful in what she tries , she is endlessly rejected . Finally , when there seems no end to it , he flees from this wickedness and from his home , and founds a new city in a foreign place : Caunus , in Caria . Then , indeed , grief made Miletus ’s daughter lose her mind completely . Then , indeed , she tore the clothes from her breast , and beat her arms in frenzy . Her madness was now public , and she confessed her hope of illicit union , by leaving the country she hated , and her household gods , and following the footsteps of her fleeing brother . The women of Bubasos saw Byblis , howling in the open fields , as your Thracians , son of Semele , pricked by your thyrsus , keep your triennial festival . Leaving them behind she wandered through Caria , through the lands of the armed Leleges , and on through Lycia . Now she was beyond Lycian Cragus , and Limyre , and the waters of the Xanthian plain , and the ridge of Mount Chimaera near Phaleris , where the fire - breathing monster lived , joining a lion ’s head and chest to a serpent ’s tail . Above the woods , when , wearied , you were weak from following , you fell , Byblis , your hair spread on the hard earth , and your face pressing the fallen leaves . The Lelegeian nymphs often try to lift her in their tender arms , and often they teach her how she might remedy her love , and they offer comfort to her silent heart . She lies there , mute , clutching at the green stems with her fingers , and watering the grass with her flowing tears . They say the naiads created a spring from them , beneath her , which could never run dry . Well , what more could they offer her ? There and then , Byblis , Phoebus ’s granddaughter , consumed by her own tears , is changed into a fountain : just as drops of resin ooze from a cut pine , or sticky bitumen from heavy soil , or as water , that has been frozen by the cold , melts in the sun , at the coming of the west wind ’s gentle breath : and even now in those valleys it retains its mistress ’s name , and flows from underneath a dark holm oak . Perhaps , the story of this new marvel would have filled Crete ’s hundred cities , if Crete had not recently known a miracle nearer home , in the metamorphosis of Iphis . In the Phaestos region , near royal Cnossos , there once lived a man named Ligdus , undistinguished , a native of the place , his wealth no greater than his fame , but living a blameless and honourable life . When his pregnant wife , Telethusa , was near to her time , he spoke these words of warning in her ear : ‘
89452	89682	89435	89435	I	0	’ He spoke , and tears flooded their cheeks , he who commanded , and she to whom the command was given . Nevertheless , Telethusa , urged her husband , with vain prayers , not to confine hope itself . Ligdus remained fixed in his determination . Now , her pregnant belly could scarcely bear to carry her fully - grown burden , when Io , the daughter of Inachus , at midnight , in sleep ’s imagining , stood , or seemed to stand , by her bed : Isis , accompanied by her holy procession . The moon ’s crescent horns were on her forehead , and the shining gold of yellow ears of corn , and royal splendour belonged to her . With her were the jackal - headed Anubis , the hallowed cat - headed Bast , the dappled bull Apis , and Harpocrates , the god who holds his tongue , and urges silence , thumb in mouth . The sacred rattle , the sistrum , was there ; and Osiris , for whom her search never ends ; and the strange serpent she fashioned , swollen with sleep - inducing venom , that poisoned the sun - god Ra . Then , as if Telethusa had shaken off sleep , and was seeing clearly , the goddess spoke to her , saying : ‘
89757	90102	89748	89749	the divinity	4047	’ Having given her command , she left the room . Joyfully , the Cretan woman rose , and , lifting her innocent hands to the stars , she prayed , in all humility , that her dream might prove true . When the pains grew , and her burden pushed its own way into the world , and a girl was born , the mother ordered it to be reared , deceitfully , as a boy , without the father realising . She had all that she needed , and no one but the nurse knew of the fraud . The father made good his vows , and gave it the name of the grandfather : he was Iphis . The mother was delighted with the name , since it was appropriate for either gender , and no one was cheated by it . From that moment , the deception , begun with a sacred lie , went undetected . The child was dressed as a boy , and its features would have been beautiful whether they were given to a girl or a boy . Thirteen years passed by , meanwhile , and then , Iphis , your father betrothed you to golden - haired Ianthe , whose dowry was her beauty , the girl most praised amongst the women of Phaestos , the daughter of Telestes of Dicte . The two were equal in age , and equal in looks , and had received their first instruction , in the knowledge of life , from the same teachers . From this beginning , love had touched both their innocent hearts , and wounded them equally , but with unequal expectations . Ianthe anticipated her wedding day , and the promised marriage , believing he , whom she thought to be a man , would be her man . Iphis loved one whom she despaired of being able to have , and this itself increased her passion , a girl on fire for a girl . Hardly restraining her tears , she said ‘
90613	90730	90731	90731	Isis	1112	’ With these words , she stopped speaking . The other girl was no less on fire , and prayed , Hymen , that you would come quickly . Telethusa , afraid of what she sought , merely put off the day : now lengthening the delay through pretended illness , now , frequently , using omens and dreams as an excuse . But eventually every pretext was exhausted , the date for the delayed marriage ceremony was set , and only a day remained . Then Telethusa took the sacred ribbons from her own and her daughter Iphis ’s head , so that their hair streamed down , and clinging to the altar , cried : ‘
90842	91290	91291	91295	O gods of this world	4081	’ Tears followed words . The goddess seemed to make the altar tremble ( it did tremble ) , and the doors of the temple shook , her horns , shaped like the moon ’s crescents , shone , and the sistrum rattled loudly . Not yet reassured , but gladdened by the auspicious omen , the mother left the temple . Iphis , her companion , followed , taking larger paces than before ; with no whiteness left in her complexion ; with additional strength , and sharper features , and shorter , less elegant hair ; showing more vigour than women have . Take your gifts to the temple , Iphis : rejoice , with confidence , not fear ! You , who were lately a girl , are now a boy ! They take their gifts to the temple , and add a votive tablet : the tablet has this brief line : IPHIS PERFORMS AS A BOY , WHAT HE PROMISED , AS A GIRL . The next day ’s sun reveals the wide world in its rays , when Venus , and Juno , joined with Hymen , come , to the marriage torches , and Iphis , the boy , gains possession of his Ianthe . Hymen , called by the voice of Orpheus , departed , and , dressed in his saffron robes , made his way through the vast skies to the Ciconian coast : but in vain . He was present at Orpheus ’s marriage , true , but he did not speak the usual words , display a joyful expression , or bring good luck . The torch , too , that he held , sputtered continually , with tear - provoking fumes , and no amount of shaking contrived to light it properly . The result was worse than any omens . While the newly wedded bride , Eurydice , was walking through the grass , with a crowd of naiads as her companions , she was killed , by a bite on her ankle , from a snake , sheltering there . When Thracian Orpheus , the poet of Rhodope , had mourned for her , greatly , in the upper world , he dared to go down to Styx , through the gate of Taenarus , also , to see if he might not move the dead . Through the weightless throng , and the ghosts that had received proper burial , he came to Persephone , and the lord of the shadows , he who rules the joyless kingdom . Then striking the lyre - strings to accompany his words , he sang : ‘
91602	91897	92624	92624	he	4101	’ The bloodless spirits wept as he spoke , accompanying his words with the music . Tantalus did not reach for the ever - retreating water : Ixion ’s wheel was stilled : the vultures did not pluck at Tityus ’s liver : the Belides , the daughters of Danaüs , left their water jars : and you , Sisyphus , perched there , on your rock . Then they say , for the first time , the faces of the Furies were wet with tears , won over by his song : the king of the deep , and his royal bride , could not bear to refuse his prayer , and called for Eurydice . She was among the recent ghosts , and walked haltingly from her wound . The poet of Rhodope received her , and , at the same time , accepted this condition , that he must not turn his eyes behind him , until he emerged from the vale of Avernus , or the gift would be null and void . They took the upward path , through the still silence , steep and dark , shadowy with dense fog , drawing near to the threshold of the upper world . Afraid she was no longer there , and eager to see her , the lover turned his eyes . In an instant she dropped back , and he , unhappy man , stretching out his arms to hold her and be held , clutched at nothing but the receding air . Dying a second time , now , there was no complaint to her husband ( what , then , could she complain of , except that she had been loved ? ) . She spoke a last ‘
91899	92380	92630	92630	Cyparissus	1128	’ that , now , scarcely reached his ears , and turned again towards that same place . Stunned by the double loss of his wife , Orpheus was like that coward who saw Cerberus , the three - headed dog , chained by the central neck , and whose fear vanished with his nature , as stone transformed his body . Or like Olenos , and you , his Lethaea , too proud of your beauty : he wished to be charged with your crime , and seem guilty himself : once wedded hearts , you are now rocks set on moist Mount Ida . Orpheus wished and prayed , in vain , to cross the Styx again , but the ferryman fended him off . Still , for seven days , he sat there by the shore , neglecting himself and not taking nourishment . Sorrow , troubled thought , and tears were his food . He took himself to lofty Mount Rhodope , and Haemus , swept by the winds , complaining that the gods of Erebus were cruel . Three times the sun had ended the year , in watery Pisces , and Orpheus had abstained from the love of women , either because things ended badly for him , or because he had sworn to do so . Yet , many felt a desire to be joined with the poet , and many grieved at rejection . Indeed , he was the first of the Thracian people to transfer his love to young boys , and enjoy their brief springtime , and early flowering , this side of manhood . There was a hill , and , on the hill , a wide area of level ground , turfed with fresh blades of grass : shade was absent there : but when the poet , born of the god , sounded the strings of his lyre , shade gathered there . Jupiter ’s Chaonian oak - tree came ; and Phaethon ’s sisters , the Heliades , the poplars ; the durmast oak with its deep foliage ; the soft lime - tree ; the beech ; the virgin sweet - bay , laurel ; the hazel , frail ; the ash - tree , used for spears ; the sweeping silver - fir : holm - oak , heavy with acorns ; pleasant plane - tree ; the many - coloured maple ; with the river - haunting willow ; lotus , water - lover ; boxwood ever - verdant ; the slender tamarisk ; the myrtle , with , over and under its leaves , the two shades of green ; and the blue - berried wild - bay , laurus tinus . You came , also , twining ivy , together with shooting vines ; the vine - supporting elms ; the flowering ‘
92382	92615	92630	92630	Cyparissus	1128	’ ash ; the spruce ; the strawberry tree , weighed down with its red fruit ; the pliant palms , the winner ’s prize ; and you , the shaggy - topped pine tree , armed with needles , sacred to Cybele , mother of the gods , since Attis exchanged his human form for you , and hardened in your trunk . Among the crowd came the cypress , formed like the cone - shaped meta , that marks the turning point in the race - course : once a boy , but now a tree : loved by the god who tunes the lyre , and strings the bow . There was a giant stag , sacred to the nymphs that haunt the Carthaean country , which cast deep shadows , around its head , from his wide - branching antlers . The antlers shone with gold , and the gems of a jewelled collar , around his polished neck , hung down onto his shoulders . A bulla , a silver charm , fastened with small strips of leather , quivered on his forehead , and on either side of his hollow temples matching pearls of bronze gleamed from both ears . Free from fear , and forgetting his natural shyness , he used to visit people ’s houses , and offer his neck to be stroked by strangers ’
92871	92888	92860	92861	The god	1482	‘ I will mourn for you : you will mourn for others , and enter into sorrows ’
92954	93533	92949	92949	his	519	‘ Begin my song with Jupiter , Calliope , O Muse , my mother ( all things bow to Jupiter ’s might ) ! I have often sung the power of Jove before : I have sung of the Giants , in an epic strain , and the victorious lightning bolts , hurled at the Phlegraean field . Now there is gentler work for the lyre , and I sing of boys loved by the gods , and girls stricken with forbidden fires , deserving punishment for their lust . The king of the gods once burned with love for Phrygian Ganymede , and to win him Jupiter chose to be something other than he was . Yet he did not deign to transform himself into any other bird , than that eagle , that could carry his lightning bolts . Straightaway , he beat the air with deceitful wings , and stole the Trojan boy , who still handles the mixing cups , and against Juno ’s will pours out Jove ’s nectar . You too , Hyacinthus , of Amyclae , Phoebus would have placed in heaven , if sad fate had given him time to do so . Still , as it is , you are immortal , and whenever spring drives winter away , and Aries follows watery Pisces , you also rise , and flower in the green turf . My father , Phoebus , loved you above all others : and Delphi , at the centre of the world , lost its presiding deity , while the god frequented Eurotas , and Sparta without its walls , doing no honour to the zither or the bow . Forgetting his usual pursuits , he did not object to carrying the nets , handling the dogs , or travelling as a companion , over the rough mountain ridges , and by constant partnership feeding the flames . Now , the sun was midway between the vanished and the future night , equally far from either extreme : they stripped off their clothes , and gleaming with the rich olive oil , they had rubbed themselves with , they began a contest with the broad discus . Phoebus went first , balancing it , and hurling it high into the air , scattering the clouds with its weight . Its mass took a long time to fall back to the hard ground , showing strength and skill combined . Immediately the Taenarian boy , without thinking , ran forward to pick up the disc , prompted by his eagerness to throw , but the solid earth threw it back , hitting you in the face , with the rebound , Hyacinthus . The god is as white as the boy , and cradles the fallen body . Now he tries to revive you , now to staunch your dreadful wound , and now applies herbs to hold back your departing spirit . His arts are useless : the wound is incurable . Just as if , when someone , in a garden , breaks violets , stiff poppies , or the lilies with their bristling yellow stamens , and , suddenly , they droop , bowing their weakened heads , unable to support themselves , and their tops gaze at the soil : so his dying head drops , and , with failing strength , the neck is overburdened , and sinks onto the shoulder . ‘
93546	93550	93552	93552	I	0	’ Phoebus sighed , ‘

When he returned , he sought out the image of his girl , and leaning over the couch , kissed her . She felt warm : he pressed his lips to her again , and also touched her breast with his hand . The ivory yielded to his touch , and lost its hardness , altering under his fingers , as the bees ’

Ribbons with embroidered edges fluttered at her knees , and a blush spread over the girlish whiteness of her body , just as when a red awning over a white courtyard stains it with borrowed shadows .

When , from the heights , she saw the lifeless body , lying in its own blood , she leapt down , tearing her clothes , and tearing at her hair , as well , and beat at her breasts with fierce hands , complaining to the fates . “ And yet not everything is in your power ” she said . “ Adonis , there shall be an everlasting token of my grief , and every year an imitation of your death will complete a re - enactment of my mourning . But your blood will be changed into a flower . Persephone , you were allowed to alter a woman ’s body , Menthe ’s , to fragrant mint : shall the transformation of my hero , of the blood of Cinyras , be grudged to me ? ” So saying , she sprinkled the blood with odorous nectar : and , at the touch , it swelled up , as bubbles emerge in yellow mud . In less than an hour , a flower , of the colour of blood , was created such as pomegranates carry , that hide their seeds under a tough rind . But enjoyment of it is brief ; for , lightly clinging , and too easily fallen , the winds deflower it , which are likewise responsible for its name , windflower : anemone . While the poet of Thrace , with songs like these , drew to himself the trees , the souls of wild beasts , and the stones that followed him , see , how the frenzied Ciconian women , their breasts covered with animal skins , spy Orpheus from a hilltop , as he matches songs to the sounding strings . One of them , her hair scattered to the light breeze , called : ‘
100709	101457	101489	101489	he	717	’ and hurled her spear at the face of Apollo ’s poet , as he was singing . Tipped with leaves , it marked him , without wounding . The next missile was a stone , that , thrown through the air , was itself overpowered by the harmony of voice and lyre , and fell at his feet , as though it were begging forgiveness for its mad audacity . But in fact the mindless attack mounted , without restraint , and mad fury ruled . All their missiles would have been frustrated by his song , but the huge clamour of the Berecyntian flutes of broken horn , the drums , and the breast - beating and howls of the Bacchantes , drowned the sound of the lyre . Then , finally , the stones grew red , with the blood of the poet , to whom they were deaf . First , the innumerable birds , the snakes , and the procession of wild animals , still entranced by the voice of the singer , a mark of Orpheus ’s triumph , were torn apart by the Maenads . Then they set their bloody hands on Orpheus , and gathered , like birds that spy the owl , the bird of night , wandering in the daylight , or as in the amphitheatre , on the morning of the staged events , on either side , a doomed stag , in the arena , is prey to the hounds . They rushed at the poet , and hurled their green - leaved thyrsi , made for a different use . Some threw clods of earth , some branches torn from the trees , and others flints . And so that their madness did not lack true weapons , by chance , oxen were turning the soil under the ploughshare , and , not far away from them , brawny farm workers were digging the solid earth , sweating hard to prepare it for use , who fled when they saw the throng , leaving their work tools behind . Hoes , heavy mattocks , and long rakes lay scattered through the empty fields . After catching these up , and ripping apart the oxen , that threatened them with their horns , the fierce women rushed back to kill the poet . As he stretched out his hands , speaking ineffectually for the first time ever , not affecting them in any way with his voice , the impious ones murdered him : and the spirit , breathed out through that mouth to which stones listened , and which was understood by the senses of wild creatures – O , God ! – vanished down the wind . The birds , lamenting , cried for you , Orpheus ; the crowd of wild creatures ; the hard flints ; the trees that often gathered to your song , shedding their leaves , mourned you with bared crowns . They say the rivers , also , were swollen with their own tears , and the naiads and dryads , with dishevelled hair , put on sombre clothes . The poet ’s limbs were strewn in different places : the head and the lyre you , Hebrus , received , and ( a miracle ! ) floating in midstream , the lyre lamented mournfully ; mournfully the lifeless tongue murmured ; mournfully the banks echoed in reply . And now , carried onward to the sea , they left their native river - mouth and reached the shores of Lesbos , at Methymna . Here , as the head lay exposed on the alien sand , its moist hair dripping brine , a fierce snake attacked it . But at last Phoebus came , and prevented it , as it was about to bite , and turned the serpent ’s gaping jaws to stone , and froze the mouth , wide open , as it was . The ghost of Orpheus sank under the earth , and recognised all those places it had seen before ; and , searching the fields of the Blessed , he found his wife again and held her eagerly in his arms . There they walk together side by side ; now she goes in front , and he follows her ; now he leads , and looks back as he can do , in safety now , at his Eurydice . ’
101897	101914	101915	101915	he	1152	‘ Make it so that whatever I touch with my body , turns to yellow gold , ’
102277	102307	102273	102273	he	4411	‘ Father , Bacchus , forgive me ! I have sinned . But have pity on me , I beg you , and save me from this costly evil ! ’
102340	102356	102357	102357	he	4411	‘ So you do not remain coated with the gold you wished for so foolishly , ’
102360	102421	102357	102357	he	4411	‘ go to the river by great Sardis , make your way up the bright ridge against the falling waters , till you come to the source of the stream , and plunge your head and body at the same moment into the foaming fountain , where it gushes out , and at the same time wash away your sin . ’
102661	102670	102658	102658	he	549	‘ There is nothing to prevent my judging . ’
103130	103135	103126	103128	Jupiter the Thunderer	1158	‘ source of all oracles ’
103235	103241	103244	103244	he	6572	‘ You will not go unpunished ’
103271	103457	103258	103258	He	6572	’ crops , and buried the fields beneath the waves . Even this was insufficient punishment : He demanded also that Hesione , the king ’s daughter , be given to a sea - monster , whom Hercules freed , as she was chained to the solid rock . Hercules demanded the payment promised , an agreed number of horses . But the reward for all his work being refused , he seized the twice - perjured walls of conquered Troy . Telamon , his companion , did not go without honour , and Hesione was given to him in marriage . Peleus , Telamon ’s brother , was already distinguished by having a goddess as his wife , and was not more proud of being Jupiter ’s grandson ( his father Aeacus being the son of Jove by Aegina ) as his son - in - law ( by marrying Thetis ) , since he was not the only brother to be Jove ’s grandson , but he was the only one to marry a goddess . For aged Proteus had said to Thetis : ‘
103493	103828	103829	103831	Son of Aeacus	3520	’ So Jupiter , lest earth produce someone greater than himself , fled from union with ocean - dwelling Thetis , though he had felt the hot fire of passion in his heart , and ordered his grandson , Peleus , son of Aeacus , to fulfil his promise , on his behalf , and enter the arms of the sea - maiden . There is a bay , shaped like a scythe , in Haemonia , its arms projecting in a curved arc , which would provide a harbour , if the waves were deeper : the waters cover the surface of the sand : the shore is solid earth , that takes no footprints , does not hinder a passage , and has no seaweed covering it . A myrtle grove grows nearby , dense with its red and black berries . There is a cave in the centre , whether fashioned by art or nature is uncertain , but probably by art . Often , Thetis you used to come there , naked , seated on a bridled dolphin . There Peleus found you , as you lay , overcome by sleep , and when , though influenced by his entreaties , you refused him , he prepared to use force , winding both arms round your neck . He would have taken you then , if you had not , by your well - known arts , frequently changed your form . But when you became a bird , he still held you as a bird ; now as a tree , Peleus clung fast to the tree . Your third guise was a striped tigress : in fear of that the son of Aeacus loosed his arms from your body . Then he entreated the gods of the sea , with wine poured over the waters , with sheep ’s entrails , and the smoke of incense , until Proteus , the Carpathian seer spoke from his deep gulfs : ‘
103892	103995	103865	103865	she	4471	’ So he spoke , and hid his face below the waves , letting the waters flow in upon his final words . Now Titan was low in the sky , and , his chariot pointed downwards , was close to the western ocean , when the lovely Nereid left the waves , and came to her accustomed bed . Peleus had scarcely taken a good grip of her virgin body , when she took on new forms , until she realised her limbs were tightly bound , and her arms spread wide apart . Then at length she sighed , saying : ‘
104006	104253	104254	104254	Peleus	974	’ and she showed herself as Thetis . When she acknowledged herself , the hero embraced her , achieved his wish , and conceived with her the mighty Achilles . Peleus was happy in his wife and son , and was a man for whom all things were successful , if you exclude the crime of killing his brother Phocus . Guilty of shedding his brother ’s blood , exiled from his father ’s country , the soil of Trachin gave him sanctuary . Here Ceyx , son of Lucifer , the morning star , ruled , without force or shedding blood , his face filled with his father ’s radiance . At that time he was sad and unlike his normal self , mourning the loss of his brother , Daedalion . The son of Aeacus came to him , weary with cares and travel , and entered the city with a few companions . He left the flocks of sheep and cattle he had brought with him in a shady valley not far from the city walls . When he was first allowed to meet the king , he held out the draped olive branch of the suppliant , and told him whose son he was , concealed his crime , and lied about the cause of his flight . He begged to be allowed to support himself in the city or the fields . The king of Trachin replied with these kind words : ‘
104338	104362	104327	104327	I	0	’ And he wept . Peleus and his companions asked what the cause was of so much grief , to which he replied : ‘
104929	105051	105053	105053	Lucifer	623	’ stings . Even then to me he seemed to run faster than humanly possible , and you would have thought he had winged feet . He escaped us all , swift with desire for death , and gained the summit of Parnassus . When Daedalion hurled himself from the high cliffs , Apollo , pitying him , turned him into a bird , and lifted him , pendent on suddenly - formed wings , giving him a hooked beak , and curved talons , his former courage , and greater strength of body . Now , as a hawk , he rages against all birds , is merciful to none , and , suffering , is a cause of suffering . ’
105085	105098	105099	105099	Peleus	974	‘ Peleus ! Peleus ! I bring you news of grave trouble . ’
105123	105447	105119	105120	The herdsman	3627	‘ When the sun was at the zenith , seeing as much of the track left as he had already run , I had driven the tired oxen down to the bay . Some of the bullocks were kneeling on the yellow sand , lying there gazing out at the wide expanse of ocean ; some were wandering slowly here and there ; while others had waded out and stood up to their necks in the water . There is a temple near the sea , not gleaming with gold and marble , but made of heavy timber , and shaded by an ancient grove . Nereus and the Nereids haunt it ( a sailor , drying his nets on the shore , told me they were the gods of those waters ) . Close to it , there is a swamp , choked with dense willows , which the salt flood has turned into marshland . From it , a wolf , a huge beast , terrifies the places round about with its heavy crashing noises . It came out of the marsh reeds , its deadly jaws smeared with foam and clots of blood , and its eyes filled with red flame . It was savage with rage and hunger , more with rage ; since though hungry it did not bother with the dead cattle , or with satisfying its deadly appetite , but wounded the whole herd , slaughtering them all in its hostility . Some of our men were wounded by its fatal jaws while protecting them , and given up as dead . The shore and the shallows were red with blood , and the marshes full of bellowing . But delay is fatal : the thing allows no hesitation . While there are some of us left , let us encounter it in armour , and , seizing our weapons , meet with it carrying spears ! ’
105587	105641	105578	105578	Peleus	974	‘ Queen Alcyone , forget these loving fears that so become you ! I am grateful for your husband ’s offer of help , but I have no wish for arms to be used against the creature on my behalf . I must pray , instead , to the goddess of the ocean ! ’
105982	106288	105979	105979	she	955	‘ What sin of mine has turned your mind to this , dear one ? Where is that care for me that used to come first ? Can you now leave Alcyone behind , without a thought ? Does it please you now to travel far ? Am I dearer to you , away from you ? But I suppose your way is overland , and I shall only grieve , not fear , for you . My anxieties will be free from terror . The waters scare me , and the sombre face of the deep : and lately I saw wrecked timbers on the shore , and I have often read the names on empty tombs . Do not allow your mind to acquire false confidence , because Aeolus , son of Hippotas , is your father - in - law , who keeps the strong winds imprisoned , and , when he wishes , calms the sea . When once the winds are released and hold sway over the waters , nothing can oppose them : every country , every ocean is exposed to them . They vex the clouds in the sky , and create the red lightning - flashes from their fierce collisions . The more I know of them ( I do know them , often seeing them as a child in my father ’s house ) the more I consider them to be feared . But if no prayers can alter your purpose , dear one , husband , if you are so fixed on going , take me with you , also ! Then we shall be storm - tossed together , and at least I shall know what I fear , together we shall bear whatever comes , together we shall be borne over the waters . ’
106373	106415	106359	106359	He	4543	‘ Every delay will seem long to us indeed , but I swear to you by my father ’s light , to return to you as long as the fates allow it , before the moon has twice completed her circle . ’
106492	106494	106479	106479	She	955	‘ Farewell ’
106755	106768	106769	106769	He	4556	‘ Lower the yards , now , and close reef all sails . ’
108006	108050	108003	108003	she	955	‘ Iris , most faithful carrier of my words , go quickly to the heavy halls of Sleep , and order him to send Alcyone a dream - figure in the shape of her dead Ceyx , to tell her his true fate . ’
108456	108461	108453	108453	she	1783	‘ Sleep , all things ’
108540	108844	108537	108537	Juno	525	’ After she had completed her commission , Iris departed , no longer able to withstand the power of sleep , and , feeling the drowsiness steal over her body , she fled , and re - crossed the arch by which she had lately come . From a throng of a thousand sons , his father roused Morpheus , a master craftsman and simulator of human forms . No one else is as clever at expressing the movement , the features , and the sound of speech . He depicts the clothes and the usual accents . He alone imitates human beings . A second son becomes beast , or bird , or long snake ’s body . The gods call him Icelos , the mortal crowd Phobetor . The third , of diverse artistry , is Phantasos : he takes illusory shapes of all inanimate things , earth , stones , rivers , trees . These are the ones that show themselves by night to kings and generals , the rest wander among citizens and commoners . Old Somnus passed them by , choosing one of all these brothers , Morpheus , to carry out the command of Iris , daughter of Thaumas , and relaxing again into sweet drowsiness , his head drooped and he settled into his deep bed . Flying through the shadows on noiseless wings , Morpheus , after a short delay , comes to the Haemonian city . Shedding his wings , he takes the shape of Ceyx , pallid like the dead , and naked , and stands before his unfortunate wife ’s bed . He appears with sodden beard , and seawater dripping from his matted hair . Then he bends over her pillow , with tears streaming down his face , and says : ‘
109004	109063	108971	108971	you	4646	’ Morpheus spoke these words in a voice she would believe to be her husband ’s ( the tears that he wept also seemed real tears ) and his hands revealed Ceyx ’s gestures . Alcyone groaned , tearfully , stirring her arms in sleep , and seeking his body , grasped only air , and cried out : ‘
109078	109185	109186	109186	Alcyone	955	’ Roused by her own voice , and her husband ’s image , she started up out of sleep . First she gazed round to see if he was still there , the one she had just seen . At the sound of her cry the servants had brought a lamp . Not finding him anywhere , she struck her face with her hands , tore her clothes from her breasts , and beat at the breasts themselves . She did not wait to loosen her hair , but tore at it , and shouted at her nurse , who asked the cause of her grief : ‘
109305	109317	109296	109298	my poor husband	4661	’ and she tried to find a trace of his footprints . ‘
109511	109569	109502	109502	I	0	’ Grief choked further words , and lamentation took their place wholly , and sighs drawn from a stricken heart . Morning had broken . She went out of the house towards the shore , sadly seeking the place where she had watched him depart . And while she stayed there , and while she was saying : ‘
109586	109677	109579	109579	he	4661	’ and while she recalled the significant actions by their locations , and looked seawards , she saw in the flowing waves what looked like a body , unsure at first what it was : after the tide had brought it a little nearer , though it was some way off , it was clearly a body . She did not know whose it was , but was moved by the omen of this shipwrecked man , and as if she wept for the unknown dead , she cried out : ‘
109699	109752	109755	109755	him	4670	’ The body had been washed nearer by the sea , and the more she gazed at it , the smaller and smaller shrank her courage : woe ! Now it was close to land , now she could see who it was : it was her husband ! She cried out : ‘
109757	109780	109755	109755	him	4670	’ and together tearing at cheeks , and hair , and clothes she stretched out her trembling hands to Ceyx , saying : ‘
109804	109954	109755	109755	him	4670	’ A breakwater built by the waves , broke the initial force of the sea , and weakened the onrush of the tide . Though it was amazing that she could do so , she leapt onto it : she flew , and , beating the soft air on new - found wings , a sorrowing bird , she skimmed the surface of the waves . As she flew , her plaintive voice came from a slender beak , like someone grieving and full of sorrows . When she reached the mute and bloodless corpse , she clasped the dear limbs with her new wings and kissed the cold lips in vain with her hard beak . People doubted whether Ceyx felt this , or merely seemed to raise his face by a movement of the waves , but he did feel it : and at last through the gods ’
110039	110083	110026	110026	Aeolus	511	’ waves . Seeing these birds flying together over the wide sea , some old man praised those affections maintained till the end . Someone near by , or the same man ( pointing to a long - necked diving bird ) said : ‘
110422	110492	110413	110414	The lover	2082	‘ I regret , I regret I followed you ! But I did not expect this , and it was not worth this to attempt to win you . We two have destroyed you , poor girl : the wound given by a snake , the cause of it all myself ! Let me be the more accursed , if I do not send you solace by my death . ’
110906	110928	110930	110930	he	4721	‘ We will conquer , Greeks , rejoice ! Troy will fall , though our efforts will be of long duration , ’
111635	111656	111611	111611	he	1161	‘ O youth , whoever you may be , take death ’s comfort in being killed by Achilles of Haemonia ! ’
111706	111713	111714	111714	Cycnus	598	‘ O son of the goddess , ’
111717	111832	111833	111833	He	4764	‘ fame has made you known to me , why are you amazed I have no wound ? ( He was indeed amazed ) Neither this helmet you see , with its yellow horsehair crest , nor the hollow shield weighing down my left arm , is to protect me : they only look to serve as ornament . Mars too wears his armour for this reason ! Take away the use of this protective covering : I will still escape unharmed . It is worth something to be the son , not of Nereus ’s daughter , but of him who rules Nereus and his daughters , and the whole ocean as well . ’
111967	111973	111974	111974	he	4764	‘ Is my hand enfeebled , ’
111977	111990	111974	111974	he	4764	‘ so that the power it had is lacking against this man ? ’
112081	112144	112665	112665	their	4776	’ He spoke , and as if not believing the results of his previous actions , he threw the spear straight at Menoetes , one of the Lycian men , simultaneously piercing his breastplate and the breast beneath . As the dying man beat his head against the solid earth , Achilles pulled the spear from the hot wound , and cried : ‘
112181	112660	112665	112665	their	4776	’ Thus he pursued the death of Cycnus again , and the ashen shaft did not err , thudding unavoidably into the left shoulder , from which it recoiled as if from a wall or a solid rock . Achilles saw that Cycnus was stained with blood where it struck , and exulted , but in vain : there was no wound : it was Menoetes ’s blood ! Then truly maddened , he leapt headlong from his high chariot , and seeking out his charmed enemy , at close quarters , with glittering sword , saw shield and helmet carved through , but still the iron blunted on the impenetrable body . He could stand it no longer , and he beat at the face and hollow temples of his enemy three or four times with his raised shield and sword - hilt . One presses as the other gives way : he rushes and harries him , allowing no respite from the shock . Fear grips Cycnus , shadows swim in front of his eyes , and , as he steps backwards , his retreating step is blocked , by a boulder , on the open ground . As he is trapped with his body bent against it , Achilles turns him over with great force , and dashes him to the ground . Then pressing his hard knees and shield into Cycnus ’s chest , he pulls on the helmet straps , which , tightening under the chin , squeeze the throat and windpipe , and stop the passage of breath . He prepares to strip his defeated enemy : he sees empty armour : the god of the sea has changed the body into that of a white bird , whose name is the one he bore , but a moment ago . This battle brought about that truce , of many days duration , when both sides grounded their weapons and rested . While alert sentries patrolled the Trojan walls and alert sentries patrolled the Greek trenches , a feast day arrived , on which Achilles , the victor over Cycnus , was propitiating Pallas with the blood of a sacrificial cow . When its entrails had been placed on the blazing altars , and the perfume the gods love had climbed to the heavens , part was put aside for their holy rites , and the rest set out on the tables . The leaders reclined on couches , and ate their fill of the roasted meat , while they quenched their thirst , and drowned their cares , with wine . The zither , the sound of singing , the long boxwood flute pierced with many holes , was not their entertainment , rather they lengthened the night with talk , and courage was their theme . They talked of their enemies ’
112761	112839	112758	112758	Nestor	1027	‘ Cycnus has been the only one among your generation who ignored swords , and whom no blow could pierce . But , long ago , I myself saw one Caeneus of Thessaly , who could take a thousand strokes with unwounded body : Thessalian Caeneus , I say , who , famous for his exploits , lived on Mount Othrys , and what made it more remarkable in him , he had been born a woman . ’
112866	112924	112858	112858	Achilles	1161	‘ Say on , old one ! O ancient eloquence , wisdom of our age , all of us equally desire to hear , who Caeneus was , why he was changed to his opposite , what campaign you met him in , fighting against whom , by whom he was overcome , if anyone overcame him . ’
112931	113279	112926	112928	the old warrior	4782	‘ Though the slowness of age hampers me , and many things I once saw have slipped from me , I can still remember many . Nothing sticks more firmly in my mind than this , amongst all those acts , in battle and at home , and if length of years alone enabled a man to report many deeds , I have lived two hundred years : now I live in my third century . Elatus ’s daughter , Caenis , loveliest of the virgins of Thessaly , was famous for her beauty , a girl longed for in vain , the object of many suitors throughout the neighbouring cities and your own ( since she was one of your people , Achilles ) . Perhaps Peleus also would have tried to we d her , but he had already taken your mother in marriage , or she was promised to your father . Caenis would not agree to any marriage , but ( so rumour has it ) she was walking along a lonely beach , and the god took her by force . When Neptune had enjoyed his new love he said : “ Make your wish , without fear of refusal . Ask for what you most want ! ” ( The same rumour mentioned this . ) “ This injury evokes the great desire never to be able to suffer any such again . Grant I might not be a woman : you will have given me everything , ” Caenis said . She spoke the last words in a deeper tone that might have been the sound of a man ’s voice . So it was : the god of the deep ocean had already accepted her wish , and had granted , over and above it , that as a man Caeneus would be protected from all wounds , and never fall to the sword . Caeneus , the Atracides , left , happy with his gifts , and spent his time in manly pastimes , roaming the Thessalian fields . ’
113280	113504	113512	113512	Eurytus	799	‘ Pirithoüs , the daring son of Ixion , married Hippodame , and invited the cloud - born centaurs to take their place at tables , set in lines , in a tree - shaded cave . Caeneus , and the other Thessalian princes were there , and I was there myself . The festive palace echoed with the noisy crowd . See , they were singing the marriage song , and the great hall smoked with fires , and in came the virgin surrounded by a throng of young wives and mothers , conspicuous , in her beauty . We declared Pirithoüs to be blessed in his bride , which almost betrayed his good fortune . For your heart was heated by the sight of the girl as much as by wine , Eurytus , most savage of the savage Centaurs : and drunkenness twinned with lust ruled it . At once the tables were overturned and the banquet in turmoil , and the new bride was grabbed by the hair and dragged off by force . Eurytus seized Hippodame : the others whosoever they wished to , or could , and it looked like the rape of a city . The palace sounded with women ’s cries . We all leaped up quickly , and Theseus , first , shouted out : ‘
113674	113681	113668	113669	each other	2544	‘ To arms ! To arms ! ’
113723	113724	113727	113727	Amycus	1203	’ ‘
114291	114292	114293	114294	The victor	6480	’ ‘

116789	117335	116775	116775	Caeneus	1014	’ and he drove his fatal weapon into the other ’s side , turning and twisting his hand , buried in the guts , causing wound on wound . See , the centaurs maddened , rushed on him with a great shout , and all aimed and threw their spears at the one man . The spears fell , blunted : and Caeneus , son of Elatus , remained unpierced and unbloodied by all their efforts . This marvel astonished them . “ Oh , what overwhelming shame ! ” Monychus exclaimed . “ A people defeated by one who is scarcely a man : yet he is the man , and we , with our half - hearted attempts are what he once was . What use are our huge limbs ? What use our twin powers , and that double nature uniting the strongest living things in us ? We are not sons of a divine mother : nor of Ixion who was such as aspired to captivate great Juno : we are overcome by an enemy , who is half a man ! Roll down rocks and tree trunks on him , and whole mountainsides , and crush that stubborn spirit with the forests we hurl ! Let their mass constrict his throat , and let weight work instead of wounds . ” He spoke , and finding a chance tree - trunk toppled by a furious southerly wind , he threw it at his powerful enemy . He served as the example , and in a little while Mount Othrys was bare of trees , and Pelion had lost its shade . Buried under the huge pile , Caeneus strained against the weight of trees , and propped up the mass of oak on his strong shoulders , but as it mounted above his mouth and face , he had no breath of the air that he breathed , and lacking it , often , he tried in vain to raise himself into the air , and throw off the forest piled on him , and often heaved , as if steep Mount Ida , that we see there , look , was shaken by an earthquake . His fate is doubtful : some said his body was thrust down to empty Tartarus , by the mass of forest : but Mopsus , the son of Ampycus denied this . He saw a bird with tawny wings fly into the clear air from the midst of the pile , which I saw also , then , for the first and last time ever . As Mopsus watched him smoothly circling his camp in flight , making a great noise , he pursued him with mind and vision , saying “ Hail to you , Caeneus , glory of the race of Lapiths , once a great hero , but now a bird alone ! ” The thing was believed because of its author : grief was added to anger , and we could barely accept one man being conquered by so many enemies . Nor did we cease to work off our pain with the sword until half were dead , and half , fleeing , were swallowed by the night . ’
117388	117420	117423	117423	him	1259	‘ Old man , it is amazing that your recital forgot to praise Hercules : certainly my father often used to tell me of the cloud - born centaurs he defeated . ’
117427	117832	117421	117421	Nestor	1027	‘ Why do you force me to remember wrongs , to re - open wounds healed by the years , and to reveal hatred for your father and the injuries he did me ? He has done deeds beyond belief , the gods know , and filled the earth with his praises : that , I wish I could deny . But we do not praise Deïphobus , or Polydamas , or Hector : who praises an enemy indeed ? That father of yours razed Messene ’s walls ; destroyed the innocent cities of Elis and Pylos , and overthrew my household gods with fire and sword . I say nothing of the others he killed : there were twelve of us , sons of Neleus , outstanding young men , all except myself fell to Hercules ’s strength . We must accept that the others could be defeated : the death of Periclymenus was strange , whom Neptune , founder of Neleus ’s bloodline , had granted the power to assume any form he wished and reverse that which he had assumed . Now , after he had changed to every form in turn , he reverted to the shape of a bird , the eagle that carries the lightning bolts in its curved talons , beloved by the king of the gods . He tore at the hero ’s face with all the power of his wings , his hooked beak , and crooked claws . Then , as he soared among the clouds , and hung poised there , the Tirynthian fired his unerring bow at him , and pierced him where the wing meets the side . The wound was not fatal , but the sinews , severed by the wound , failed , devoid of movement or power of flight . He fell to earth , his weakened pinions not mastering the air , and the arrow , clinging lightly to the wing , was driven upwards with the body ’s weight , and forced through the top of the breast into the left side of the throat . Now , O most glorious leader of the Rhodian fleet , do you think I should cry out your Hercules ’s praises ? Yet I look for no other revenge for my brothers than to be silent about his mighty deeds : there is unbroken friendship between you and me . ’
117951	118098	117938	117938	he	4706	‘ O , by far the best loved of my brother ’s sons , who built the walls of Troy with me , to no purpose , do you sigh at all to see these battlements at the moment of their destruction ? Do you grieve at all that so many thousands died defending her walls ? Not to name all of them , does not the shade come before you of Hector , dragged round his own citadel , Pergama ? But savage Achilles , crueller than war itself , is still alive , ravager of our creation . Let him be given up to me . I would let him feel what I can do with my three - pronged spear : but since I am not allowed to meet face to face with the enemy , destroy him unexpectedly with a hidden arrow ! ’
118152	118187	118149	118149	he	1684	‘ Why waste your arrows on the blood of the rank and file ? If you care for your own , aim at Achilles , grandson of Aeacus , and avenge your dead brothers ! ’
118609	120179	118606	118606	he	605	‘ It is in front of these vessels I plead my cause , and Ulysses opposes me , by Jupiter ! Yet he did not hesitate to give way before Hector ’s blazing torches , which I resisted , which I drove away from the boats . But then , it is less risky to battle using lying words , than to fight with fists , and I am not prompt to speak , as he is not to act . I am as powerful in the fierce conflicts of the battle , as that man is in talk . I do not think however that I need to mention my deeds to you , Pelasgians , since you have seen them : let Ulysses tell you of his that are conducted without witness , in which night is the only sharer ! I confess the prize I seek is great : but my rival detracts from the honour of it . There is nothing magnificent for Ajax in it , however great the thing is , if Ulysses has aspired to it . He has already won the prize in this contest , since when he is defeated he can say he fought it out with me . As for me , if my courage were in doubt , my noble birth is a powerful argument , a son of Telamon , he who , under brave Hercules , captured the walls of Troy , and sailed in the ship from Pagasae , with the Argonauts , to Colchis . Telamon ’s father was Aeacus , who judges there , among the silent dead , where Sisyphus , son of Aeolus rolls his heavy stone . Lofty Jupiter acknowledges Aeacus and confesses him to be his son : so Ajax is third in descent from Jove . Yet even this ancestry would not further my cause , if I did not share it with great Achilles . Our fathers , Peleus and Aeacus , were brothers : Achilles was my cousin , I ask for my cousin ’s weapons ! Why are you , Ulysses , the son of Sisyphus , and similar to him in your capability for fraud and trickery , involving an alien race in the affairs of the Aeacidae ? Are the arms denied me because I took up arms first , and without being rooted out , and shall he seem the better man who seized his weapons last , and shirked the fight with a pretence of madness , until Palamades , son of Nauplius , the shrewder man , uncovered this cowardly spirit ’s deceit , and dragged him to the weapons he shunned ? Shall he own all , who wanted none : shall I , who was the first to put myself at risk , be denied honour , and my cousin ’s gifts ? If only his madness had been real , or been believed , and this exhorter to crime had never been our companion against the Phrygian fortresses ! Then Lemnos would not hold you , to our shame , Philoctetes , son of Poeas , of whom they say that , hidden in the woodland caves , you move the stones , now , with your laments , calling down on Laërtes ’s son the curses that he deserves , and , if there are gods , do not curse in vain ! Now , alas , he who was sworn to the same conflict as ourselves , one of our captains , heir to Hercules ’s arrows , weakened by sickness and hunger , clothed and fed by the birds , employs the arrows , that fate intended for Troy , in firing at birds ! Still , he is alive , because he did not accompany Ulysses further : luckless Palamades would have preferred to be left behind also : he would have been alive , or at least have died an irreproachable death : that man there , remembering all too well the exposure of his own supposed madness , accused him of betraying the Greek cause , and uncovered gold , he had previously hidden , as evidence of the fabricated charge . So , by abandonment or death , he has drawn the strength of Achaea : that is how Ulysses fights , that is why he is to be feared ! Though he be greater than Nestor , the true , in eloquence , I will never believe that his desertion of Nestor in battle was anything but a crime . When Nestor implored Ulysses ’s help , weary as he was with old age , and slowed by a wound to his horse , he was abandoned by his companion . Diomede , son of Tydeus , is well aware that I am not inventing the charge : he called Ulysses repeatedly , by name , and reproached his cowardly friend for running away . The gods look down , with the eyes of the just , at human dealings ! Look , he who gave no help needs it : and as he had abandoned Nestor , so he would have been abandoned : he himself had established his own precedent . He shouted to his companions . I approached , and saw him , trembling and pale , and shaking with fear of impending death . I thrust out the mass of my shield , and covered him as he lay there , and ( small cause for praise in that ) I saved his cowardly life . If you go through with this contest , let us revisit that spot : revisit the enemy , your wound , and your usual cowardice , hide behind my shield , and contend with me under it ! Yet , after I had snatched him up , he who was granted no strength to stand , because of his wounds , ran for it , not slowed by his wounds at all . Hector approaches , and , with him , leads the gods to battle , and brave men as well as you are terrified , Ulysses , when he rushes onwards , such is the fear he brings . I felled him to the ground with a huge rock hurled from a distance , as he was exulting in the success of his bloodthirsty slaughter . When he challenged one warrior to meet him , I withstood him . You wished the lot would fall to me , Achaeans , and your prayers were answered . If you ask what the outcome of that conflict was I was not beaten by Hector . See , the Trojans bring fire and sword , and Jupiter himself , against the Greek ships : where now is the eloquent Ulysses ? Surely I , with my own breast , shielded the thousand ships , your hope of return : grant me the arms for all that fleet . Yet , if I may speak the truth , the arms search for greater honour than I do , to be linked to my glory , and the arms seek out Ajax , not Ajax the arms . Let the Ithacan compare with these things his killing of Rhesus , and of cowardly Dolon , his taking captive Helenus , Priam ’s son , and his theft of Pallas ’s image , the Palladium : nothing performed in daylight , nothing without Diomede present . If ever you grant the armour for such worthless service , divide it , and let Diomede have the greater share of it . Nevertheless why give them to the Ithacan , who carries things out secretly , and always unarmed , deceiving the unsuspecting enemy with his tricks ? The gleam of the helmet , radiant with shining gold , will reveal his scheming , and show where he hides . The Dulichian ’s head beneath Achilles ’s helmet , will not bear so great a weight , and the spear - shaft , from Pelion , can not be anything but heavy and burdensome for his arm , unsuited to war , and the shield , with its engraved design of the vast world , will not be fit for that cowardly left hand born for stealing . Perverse man , why do you go after a prize that will cripple you , one that , if it is given you in error by the Achaean people , will be a reason for being despoiled by the enemy , not feared by them ? And running away , in which you surpass everyone , you master - coward , will turn out to be a slow game for you , if you are carrying such a weight . Add to that your shield that is rarely used in battle , and uninjured , and mine split in a thousand places from fending off spear - thrusts , that needs a new successor . Finally ( what is the use of words ? ) let us be seen together in action ! Send out the brave hero ’s arms into the middle of the enemy ranks : order them to be recovered from there , and let the retriever be equipped with what he retrieves . ’
120246	120779	120227	120227	his	2234	‘ If my wishes and yours , Pelasgians , had been worth anything , there would be no question as to who should inherit the arms in this great contest : you , Achilles , would have your armour , and we would have you . But since unequal fate has denied his presence to me and to you , ( and he made as if to wipe a tear from his eye ) , who better to take Achilles ’s place than the man through whom mighty Achilles took his place among the Greeks ? Only do not let it help him that he is slow - witted , as he seems to be , nor harm my case that my ability has always profited you Greeks . And let this eloquence of mine , if it exists , that often spoke for you , and now speaks for its master , escape envy : no man should refuse to employ his talents . Now , as to race , and ancestry , and whatever we have not personally achieved ; I hardly call those things ours . But since Ajax has recalled that he is Jove ’s great grandson , Jupiter is the founder of my bloodline also , and I am the same distance from him . Laërtes is my father , Arcesius was Laërtes ’s father , and he was the son of Jupiter : and there are no exiled criminals , like Peleus and Telamon , amongst them . Also there is the addition to my nobility of Cyllenian Mercury through my mother , Anticleia . The gods are in both my parents . But I do not claim the arms lying there because I am nobler on my mother ’s side , nor because my father is innocent of a brother ’s blood . Judge the case on its merits . Provided that it is not regarded as Ajax ’s merit that Telamon and Peleus were brothers , and that what is considered in this award is respect for ability not the claims of blood ! Or , if you are asking who is the next of kin , and the lawful heir , well Peleus is Achilles ’s father , and Pyrrhus is Achilles ’s son : where is Ajax ’s claim ? Take the arms to Peleus ’s Phthia , or Pyrrhus ’s Scyros ! Teucer is no less Achilles ’s cousin than Ajax , yet does he ask for the arms , and if he did , would he gain them ? So , since it is a contest about naked achievements , I have done more than I can recount in glib words , but I will take things in their proper order . Thetis , Achilles ’s Nereid mother , foreseeing her son ’s death , disguised his appearance , and wearing women ’s clothes he deceived everyone , including Ajax . But , among the things women buy , I placed arms to stir a man ’s spirit . Before the hero had abandoned the clothes of a girl , while he held the shield and spear , I said : ‘
120806	121550	120799	120799	you	4938	’ And I took him in hand , and sent the brave out to do brave things . So his deeds are mine : I overcame warring Telephus with my spear , and healed him with it , when he was defeated and begging for help . It is down to me that Mysian Thebes fell : credit the capture of Lesbos to me , Tenedos to me , Chryse and Cilla the cities of Apollo , and Phrygian Scyros as well . Imagine that my right hand razed Lyrnesus ’s walls to the ground . I gave you the man who could destroy fierce Hector , not to speak of those other Trojans : through me glorious Hector lies low ! I seek these arms for the arms that revealed Achilles : I gave to the living , I claim from the dead . When one man ’s sorrow fell on all the Greeks , and a thousand ships gathered at Euboean Aulis , though they waited for a long time , there were adverse winds or no wind . Then a cruel oracle ordered Agamemnon to sacrifice his innocent daughter , Iphigenia , to pitiless Diana . The father said no , angered with the gods themselves : and there is still a father even in a king . I with my skill in words turned him away from a parent ’s fondness and towards the common good . I had a difficult case indeed to plead , before ( I confess , and may Atrides pardon the confession ) a prejudiced judge , but given the needs of his brother and the expedition , and the high command vested in him , he balanced glory against blood . Then I was sent to the mother , Clytaemnestra , who was not to be persuaded , but deceived by cunning . If Telamon ’s son had gone , our sails would still be waiting for the winds . Also , as an ambassador , I was sent to Troy ’s citadel , and saw and entered the senate house of lofty Ilium , still full of heroes . As I was charged to do by Greece , for the common good , undaunted , I accused Paris , demanded the return of Helen and what Paris had plundered , and stirred Priam , and Antenor , at one with Priam . But Paris , and his brothers , and those who plundered with him , could scarcely keep their sinful hands off me ( you know it , Menelaüs ) and that first day of danger to me was shared with you . It would take a long time to tell what I have achieved that has been useful , by stratagem and deed , in the long space of this conflict . After the first onslaught the enemy kept inside the city walls for a long time , and there was no chance for open warfare . Finally in the tenth year we fought it out . What were you doing meanwhile , Ajax , you who only know about battles ? What use were you then ? If you ask what I was doing , I laid ambushes for the enemy ; surrounded the defences with a ditch ; encouraged our allies so that they might bear the weariness of a long campaign with patience of mind ; advised on how we should be fed and armed ; was sent wherever benefit required it . See , deceived by a dream in sleep , Agamemnon , the king , commanded by Jupiter , orders us to give up all concern with the war we have begun . He can justify his words by this dream ’s authority . Let Ajax prevent it , and demand that the citadel , Pergama , be destroyed , let him do what he can do , fight ! Why does he not restrain those who are for returning home ? Why does he not take up arms , and give a lead for the fickle mob to follow ? That was not too much to ask of one who never speaks without boasting : but what of the fact that he fled as well ? I saw you , Ajax , and was ashamed to see it , when , turning your back , you readied your dishonourable sails . Instantly I shouted : ‘
121577	122014	122016	122016	he	4943	’ With these words , and others , in which my anguish made me eloquent , I turned men from their flight , and led them back . Atrides assembled the allies who were quaking with fear : even then the son of Telamon did not dare utter a thing , but even Thersites dared to attack the kings with insolent words , though not without punishment from me ! I rose to my feet and urged on my frightened countrymen against the enemy , and by my voice restored their lost courage . From that time on , whatever bravery this man can be seen to have shown , is mine , who dragged him back when he was given to flight . Next , which of the Greeks praises you or seeks you out , Ajax ? Yet Diomede shares what he does with me , supports me , and always trusts Ulysses as his companion . That is something , to be singled out by Diomede from so many thousand Greeks ! No drawing of lots forced me to go : yet , disregarding the dangers of night and the enemy , I killed Dolon , the Phrygian , out on the same errand as we were , but not before I had forced him to tell what he knew , and had learned what perfidious Troy was planning . I had discovered everything , and had no need to spy further , and could now return with the glory I sought : yet not content with that , I searched out Rhesus ’s tents , and I killed him and his comrades in their camp . And so , a victor , with what I prayed for achieved , as if it were a triumph , I rode his captured chariot . Deny me the arms of Achilles , whose horses my enemy , Dolon , asked of Hector , for his night ’s work , and let Ajax be more generous than you . Why should I have to mention the ranks of Sarpedon of Lycia cut to pieces by my sword ? With bloody slaughter I killed Coeranos , Iphitus ’s son ; Alastor and Chromius ; Alcander , Halius , Noëmon and Prytanis ; and I dealt destruction to Thoön , Chersidamas , Charopes , and Ennomos driven by inexorable fate ; and others less well known fell to my hand under the walls of the city . I have wounds , friends , honourable ones , as their position shows : do not believe empty words , look ! ’
122025	122923	122022	122022	his	4943	‘ here is my breast that has always been employed in your actions ! But the son of Telamon has shed no blood for his companions , in all these years , and his flesh is unwounded ! What relevance is it that he declares he took up arms against the Trojans and against Jove ? I agree , he did ( since I do not maliciously disparage beneficial actions ) but do not let him seize the honour that is shared , and let him grant you some respect also . It was Patroclus , son of Actor , protected by being disguised in Achilles ’s armour , who pushed back the Trojans from the ships that would have gone up in flames , with Ajax , their defender . He thinks that he is the only one who dared to face Hector ’s spear , forgetting the captains and the king , and myself : he was the ninth to volunteer , and selected by the luck of the draw . But what was the result of your struggle , strongest of men ? Hector retreated without receiving a single wound . Alas , with what sadness I am forced to recall that time when Achilles , the defence of Achaia , fell ! Yet tears , grief , fear did not prevent my lifting his body from the earth : I carried the body of Achilles over these shoulders , these very shoulders , along with the weapons , that now also I am anxious to carry . I have strength enough for such a burden , and a mind that can surely appreciate the honour . Was it for this that his mother , the sea - goddess , was so ambitious for her son , that the gifts of heaven , the works of such artistry , should adorn an ignorant and thoughtless soldier ? He understands nothing of the shield ’s engraving , Ocean , or earth , or high starry sky ; the Pleiades and the Hyades , the Bear that is always clear of the waters , and opposite , beyond the Milky Way , Orion , with his glittering sword . He demands to bear armour that he does not comprehend ! What of the fact that he accuses me of shirking the harsh duties of war , and of coming late to a labour already begun ? Does he not see that he is speaking ill of great Achilles ? If you call it a crime to dissimulate , we both dissimulated : if delay is a fault , I was the earlier to arrive . A loving wife detained me , a loving mother Achilles . Our priority was given to them , the rest to you . I hardly fear an accusation , even if I can not defend myself against it , shared with such a man : he was revealed by Ulysses ’s cunning , but not Ulysses by Ajax ’s . Let us not be astonished that he pours out against me the invective from his foolish tongue , since he reproaches you shamefully . Was it a disgrace for me to accuse Palamades on an erroneous charge , but proper for you to condemn him ? But then the son of Nauplias could not defend himself against so great a crime , and one so clearly proven : nor did you merely hear of the crime : you saw it , revealed by the gold I exposed . Nor do I merit being called a criminal because Lemnos , Vulcan ’s isle , holds the son of Poeas , Philoctetes , ( defend your own actions , since you agreed to it ! ) but I will not deny that I persuaded him to withdraw from the hardships of war and the journey , and to try and relieve his terrible agonies in rest . He agreed – and he still lives ! Not only was my opinion offered in good faith , though it is enough that it was in good faith , but it turned out well . Now since our seers demand his presence for the destruction of Troy , do not commission me ! Telamon ’s son , with his eloquence , had better go and soothe that man , maddened by pain and fury , or bring him by some cunning trick ! If my mind were idle on your behalf , the River Simoïs would flow backwards , and Mount Ida stand there leafless , and Achaia help Pergama , before the skill , of foolish Ajax , would benefit the Greeks . I would go to you , harsh Philoctetes , and try to bring you back with me , though you are aggressive towards king and countrymen , and myself ; though you execrate me , and pour curses endlessly on my head ; and , in your pain , long for me to be given into your power , to drink my blood , and to have your chance at me , as I did at you . And I would gain possession of your arrows ( by Fortune ’s favour ) , as I took possession of the Dardanian seer , Helenus , whom I captured ; as I revealed the gods ’
123502	123580	123489	123489	you	4966	’ and he pointed towards Minerva ’s fatal statue . The council of princes was swayed , and it shows what eloquence can do : the gifted speaker carried away the arms of the brave hero . But Ajax , who had so often stood alone against Hector , against sword and flame , against Jove himself , could not stand against mere passion , and indignation conquered the unconquerable hero . Drawing his sword he shouted : ‘
123633	124043	123597	123597	I	0	’ He spoke , and drove the lethal weapon to its full extent into his chest , that , till then , had never felt a wound . No hand was strong enough to draw out the implanted weapon : it was the blood itself expelled it , and the bloodstained ground bore a purple flower from the green turf , that had first sprung from the wound of the Spartan , Hyacinthus . In the centre of the petals letters are inscribed , shared by the hero and the boy , one reading of them being a name , ΑΙΑΣ , and the other one , ΑΙ ΑΙ , a cry of woe . Ulysses , the winner , set sail for Lemnos , the island of Queen Hypsipyle and her father the famous Thoas , a country notorious in ancient times for the murder by its women of their men , to bring back the arrows of Tyrinthian Hercules . When he had brought them back to the Greeks , with Philoctetes their master , the last hand was dealt in the long drawn - out war . Troy fell , and Priam also . Hecuba , Priam ’s unhappy wife , when all else was lost , lost her human form , and filled the air of an alien country , where the long Hellespont narrows to a strait , with strange barking . Ilium burned ; the flames had not yet died down ; Jove ’s altar was soaking up old Priam ’s meagre stream of blood ; and Cassandra , the head priestess of Apollo , dragged along by her hair , stretched out her arms uselessly to the heavens . The Dardanian women , embracing the statues of their nation ’s gods while they still could , and thronging the burning temples , were snatched away by the victorious Greeks as enviable prizes . Astyanax , was thrown down from that tower , from which he used to see his father , Hector , whom Andromache his mother pointed out to him , as Hector fought for him , and protected the ancestral kingdom . Now Boreas , the north wind , urged the Greeks on their way , and the sails flapped in a favourable breeze . The sailers are ordered to take advantage of the wind . The Trojan women wail , kissing their native earth , abandoning the burning houses : ‘
124055	124331	124332	124332	You	4978	’ The last to embark – pitiable sight ! – was Hecuba , found among the tombs of her sons . There as she clung to their graves , trying to kiss their relics , the hands of Dulichian Ulysses dragged her away . Yet she emptied one sepulchre , and carried away with her , at her breast , Hector ’s ashes from the emptied urn . And on Hector ’s grave she left a scant offering to the dead , shreds of her grey hair , hair and tears . There is a country opposite Phrygia , where Troy stood , that the Bistones inhabit : Polymestor ’s wealthy court was there , to whom Priam your father secretly sent you , Polydorus , to be reared away from the Phrygian war : a wise plan if he had not sent great riches with you , a reward for the criminal , a temptation to the greedy spirit . When Phrygia ’s fortunes waned , the impious king of Thrace took his sword and stabbed his young foster child in the throat , and threw the body from a cliff into the sea , as if murder could be eliminated with the corpse . Agamemnon had moored his fleet on a Thracian beach until the sea calmed , and the winds were kinder . Here , suddenly the ghost of Achilles appeared from a broad fissure in the earth , as large as he used to be in life . He appeared as on the day when , with threatening face , and sword in hand , he fiercely challenged Agamemnon ’s injustice . ‘
124352	124356	124332	124332	You	4978	’ he cried , ‘
124384	124488	124380	124380	Achilles	1161	’ He spoke , and , his countrymen obeyed the pitiless ghost . Now , she was torn from her mother ’s arms , and the girl , almost Hecuba ’s only comfort , ill - fated , but with more than a woman ’s courage , was led to the burial mound and became a victim of the dread grave . She remembered who she was , set before the brutal altar , knowing the savage rite was readied for her , and when she saw Neoptolemus standing , gripping his sword , his eyes gazing at her face , she said : ‘
124511	124522	124501	124501	your	4981	’ and she uncovered both her throat and her breast , ‘
124707	124976	124701	124701	she	2965	’ She spoke , and the crowd could not restrain tears that she restrained . Then the priest , also weeping , and against his will , driving his sword home , pierced the breast she offered up . Her knees gave way , and she sank to the ground , keeping her look of fearless courage to the end . Even then , as she fell , she was careful to hide the parts that should be hidden , and to protect the honour of her chaste modesty . The Trojan women lift her body , counting over the lamented children of Priam , and recounting how much blood one house has surrendered . They weep for you , girl , and for you , Hecuba , who were lately called the royal wife , the royal parent , the image of bright Asia , now in evil circumstances , even for a prisoner , whom victorious Ulysses would not have wanted , except for the fact that you had given birth to Hector : a partner for his mother that Hector would scarcely have imagined ! Embracing the body of Polyxena , now empty of that brave spirit , she sheds the tears for her that she has shed so often for her husband , sons and country . She pours her tears over her daughter ’s wound , covers her lips with kisses , and beats at her own bruised breast . Then , tearing at her white hair caked with blood , and plucking at her breast , she said this amongst other things : ‘
125543	125568	125521	125521	I	0	’ She spoke , and went to the shore , with the stumbling steps of an old woman , tearing at her white hair . ‘
125578	125839	125521	125521	I	0	’ said the unhappy mother , wanting to draw water from the sea . There , she saw Polydorus ’s body , thrown on the beach , covered with open wounds made by Thracian spears . The Trojan women cried out , but she was dumb with grief . The grief itself obliterated both her powers of speech and the tears welling inside , and she stood unmoving like solid rock , at one moment with her gaze fixed on the ground , the next lifting her face grimly towards the sky . Now she looked at her dead son ’s face , now at his wounds , mostly at his wounds , awakening a growing anger in herself . Then it blazed out , and she , as if she were still a queen , determined on vengeance , her whole mind filled with thoughts of punishment . Hecuba , her grief mixed with anger , forgetting her age , but not forgetting her rage , like a lioness maddened by the theft of her unweaned cub , that , though she can not see her enemy , follows the traces she finds of his footsteps , found her way to the author of the dreadful crime , Polymestor . She made out that she wanted to show him a secret hoard of gold , to be given to her son . The Thracian believed her , and with his usual desire for gain , came with her secretly . Then with smooth and cunning words , he said : ‘
125877	126238	125871	125871	I	0	’ She gazed at him , grimly , as he spoke and swore his lying oath , until , her seething anger boiling over , she called on her train of captive women to attack the man , and drove her nails into his deceitful eyes , and ( made strong by anger ) tore the eyeballs from their sockets , and dipped her hand , and drank , stained with his sinful blood , not from his eyes ( nothing of them remained ) but from the holes that were his eyes . The Thracians , enraged by the murder of their king , attacked the Trojan woman , hurling stones and missiles , but she chased the stones they threw , snapping at them with a harsh growling , and , readying her jaws for words , barked when she tried to speak . The place is still there , and takes its name , Cynossema , the Monument of the Bitch , from this , and she still howls mournfully amongst the Sithonian fields , remembering endlessly her ancient suffering . Her fate moved the Trojans and her enemies the Greeks , and it moved all the gods as well , yes , all , so that even Juno , Jove ’s sister - wife , said that Hecuba did not merit such misfortune . But Aurora had no time for being moved by the fall and ruin of Hecuba and Troy , though she had aided its defence . A closer sorrow , and a private grief tormented her , the loss of her son Memnon , whom she , his bright mother , had seen wasted by Achilles ’s spear on the Phrygian plain . She saw it , and that colour , that reddens the dawn , paled , and the sky was covered with cloud . His mother could not bear to look at his body laid on the summit of the funeral pyre , but with dishevelled hair , just as she was , she did not scorn to fall at the feet of mighty Jove , adding tears to these words : ‘
126413	126901	126902	126906	O chosen priest of Phoebus	5041	’ Jupiter nodded , while Memnon ’s steep pyre collapsed in leaping flames , and the daylight was stained with columns of black smoke , like the river - fog the naiad breathes out , that does not admit the light beneath it . Dark ashes flew upwards , and gathering into a ball and solidifying , they formed a shape , and it drew life and heat from the fire ( its own lightness giving it wings ) . At first resembling a bird , then a true bird , it clapped its wings , and innumerable sisters , sprung from the same natal source , sounded too . Three times they circled the pyre , and three times their clamour rose in the air in consonance , on the fourth flight the flock divided . Then in two separate fierce bands they made war , wielding beaks and hooked talons in rage , wearying wing and breast in the struggle . Remembering they were sprung from a brave hero , they fell as offerings to the buried ashes of their kinsman ’s body . The source of these suddenly created birds gave them his name : from him they were called the Memnonides : and when the sun has transited his twelve signs , they war and die again in ritual festival . And so , while others wept to witness Hecuba ’s baying , Aurora was intent on her own grief , and even now she sheds tears , and wets the whole world with dew . Yet the fates did not allow Troy ’s destiny , also , to be overthrown with her walls . Aeneas , Cytherean Venus ’s heroic son , carried away on his shoulders her sacred icons , and bore his father , another sacred and venerable burden . He dutifully chose that prize from all his riches , and his son Ascanius , and carried over the sea in his exiled fleet , he left Antandros ’s harbour , and the sinful thresholds of Thrace , and the soil drenched in Polydorus ’s blood , and riding the favourable winds and tides , he came with his company of friends , to the city of Apollo on Delos . Anius , who ruled the people , and worshipped Phoebus , with the proper ritual , as high priest , received him in palace and temple . He showed him the city , the famous sanctuary , and the two trees to which Latona clung when she gave birth . They gave incense to the flames , poured wine onto the incense , and , in accord with custom , burned the entrails of slaughtered oxen , and then sought out the royal palace , where reclining on high couches , they ate the gifts of Ceres , and drank the wine of Bacchus . Then virtuous Anchises said : ‘
126933	126949	126950	126952	Mightiest of heroes	5045	’ Shaking his head , bound with its white sacrificial fillets , Anius replied sadly : ‘
127207	127314	127199	127199	they	2244	’ arms . They , while their arms were free , stretched them out to the sky , saying : “ Bacchus , father , bring your aid ! ” and he , who granted their gifts , helped them – if you call it help for them to lose in some strange way their human form , for I could not discover by what process they lost it , nor can I describe it . The end of this misfortune I did observe : they took wing , and became snow - white doves , the birds of your goddess - wife Anchises , Venus . ’
128089	128163	128079	128079	she	1327	‘ At least , O virgin Scylla , you are not wooed by a relentless breed of men : and you can reject them without fear , as you do . But I , whose father is Nereus , and whose mother is sea - green Doris , I , though protected by a crowd of sisters , was not allowed to flee the love of Polyphemus , the Cyclops , except through sorrow ’
128196	128219	128193	128193	she	1327	‘ Tell me , O dearest one : do not hide the cause of your sadness ( I can be so trusted ) ’
128230	128710	128193	128193	she	1327	‘ Acis was the son of Faunus and the nymph Symaethis , a great delight to his father and mother , but more so even to me , since he and I alone were united . He was handsome , and having marked his sixteenth birthday , a faint down covered his tender cheeks . I sought him , the Cyclops sought me , endlessly . If you asked , I could not say which was stronger in me , hatred of Cyclops or love of Acis , both of them were equally strong . Oh ! Gentle Venus , how powerful your rule is over us ! How that ruthless creature , terrifying even to the woods themselves , whom no stranger has ever seen with impunity , who scorns mighty Olympus and its gods , how he feels what love is , and , on fire , captured by powerful desire , forgets his flocks and caves . Now Polyphemus , you care for your appearance , and are anxious to please , now you comb your bristling hair with a rake , and are pleased to cut your shaggy beard with a reaping hook , and to gaze at your savage face in the water and compose its expression . Your love of killing , your fierceness , and your huge thirst for blood , end , and the ships come and go in safety . Meanwhile , Telemus the augur , Telemus , the son of Eurymus , whom no flight of birds could deceive , came to Sicilian Mount Aetna , addressed grim Polyphemus , and said : “ Ulysses will take from you , that single eye in the middle of your forehead . ” He laughed , and answered : “ O most foolish of seers , you are wrong , another , a girl , has already taken it . ” So he scorned the true warning , given in vain , and weighed the coast down , walking with giant tread , or returned weary to his dark cave . A wedge - shaped hillside , ending in a long spur , projects into the sea ( the waves of the ocean wash round it on both sides ) . The fierce Cyclops climbed to it , and sat at its apex , and his woolly flocks , shepherd - less , followed . Then laying at his feet the pine trunk he used as a staff , fit to carry a ship ’s rigging , he lifted his panpipes made of a hundred reeds . The whole mountain felt the pastoral notes , and the waves felt them too . Hidden by a rock , I was lying in my Acis ’s arms , and my ears caught these words , and , having heard them , I remembered : ’
128711	129692	128193	128193	she	1327	‘ Galatea , whiter than the snowy privet petals , taller than slim alder , more flowery than the meadows , friskier than a tender kid , more radiant than crystal , smoother than the shells , polished , by the endless tides ; more welcome than the summer shade , or the sun in winter , showier than the tall plane - tree , fleeter than the hind ; more than ice sparkling , sweeter than grapes ripening , softer than the swan’s - down , or the milk when curdled , lovelier , if you did not flee , than a watered garden . Galatea , likewise , wilder than an untamed heifer , harder than an ancient oak , trickier than the sea ; tougher than the willow - twigs , or the white vine branches , firmer than these cliffs , more turbulent than a river , vainer than the vaunted peacock , fiercer than the fire ; more truculent than a pregnant bear , pricklier than thistles , deafer than the waters , crueller than a trodden snake ; oh , what I wish I could alter in you , most of all , is this : that you are swifter than the deer , driven by loud barking , swifter even than the winds , and the passing breeze . But if you knew me well , you would regret your flight , and you would condemn your own efforts yourself , and hold to me : half of the mountain is mine , and the deep caves in the natural rock , where winter is not felt nor the midsummer sun . There are apples that weigh down the branches , golden and purple grapes on the trailing vines . Those , and these , I keep for you . You will pick ripe strawberries born in the woodland shadows , in autumn cherries and plums , not just the juicy blue - purples , but also the large yellow ones , the colour of fresh bees’-wax . There will be no lack of fruit from the wild strawberry trees , nor from the tall chestnuts : every tree will be there to serve you . This whole flock is mine , and many are wandering the valleys as well , many hidden by the woods , many penned in the caves . If you asked me I could not tell you how many there are : a poor man counts his flocks . You can see , you need not merely believe me , how they can hardly move their legs with their full udders . There are newborn lambs in the warn sheepfolds , and kids too , of the same age , in other pens , and I always have snow - white milk : some of it kept for drinking , and some with rennet added to curdle it . You will not have vulgar gifts or easily found pleasures , such as leverets , or does , or kids , or paired doves , or a nest from the treetops . I came upon twin cubs of a shaggy bear that you can play with : so alike you can hardly separate them . I came upon them and I said : “ I shall keep these for my mistress . ” Now Galatea , only lift your shining head from the dark blue sea : come , do not scorn my gifts . Lately , I examined myself , it ’s true , and looked at my reflection in the clear water , and , seeing my self , it pleased me . Look how large I am : Jupiter , in the sky , since you are accustomed to saying some Jove or other rules there , has no bigger a body . Luxuriant hair hangs over my face , and shades my shoulders like a grove . And do not consider it ugly for my whole body to be bristling with thick prickly hair . A tree is ugly without its leaves : a horse is ugly unless a golden mane covers its neck : feathers hide the birds : their wool becomes the sheep : a beard and shaggy hair befits a man ’s body . I only have one eye in the middle of my forehead , but it is as big as a large shield . Well ? Does great Sol not see all this from the sky ? Yet Sol ’s orb is unique . Added to that my father , Neptune , rules over your waters : I give you him as a father - in - law . Only have pity , and listen to my humble prayers ! I , who scorn Jove and his heaven and his piercing lightning bolt , submit to you alone : I fear you , Nereid : your anger is fiercer than lightning . And I could bear this contempt of yours more patiently , if you fled from everyone . But why , rejecting Cyclops , love Acis , and prefer Acis ’s embrace to mine ? Though he is pleased with himself , and , what I dislike , pleases you too , Galatea , let me just have a chance at him . Then he will know I am as strong as I am big ! I ’ll tear out his entrails while he lives , rend his limbs and scatter them over the fields , and over your ocean , ( so he can join you ! ) For I am on fire , and , wounded , I burn with a fiercer flame , and I seem to bear Aetna with all his violent powers sunk in my breast , yet you , Galatea , are unmoved . ’
129693	130257	130258	130258	Girl	5901	‘ With such useless complaints he rose ( for I saw it all ) and as a bull that can not stay still , furious when the cow is taken from it , he wanders through the woods and glades . Not anticipating such a thing , without my knowing , he saw me , and saw Acis . “ I see you , ” he cried , “ and I ’ll make this the last celebration of your love . ” His voice was as loud as an angry Cyclops ’s voice must be : Aetna shook with the noise . And I , terrified , plunged into the nearby waters . My hero , son of Symaethis , had turned his back , and ran , crying : “ Help me , I beg you , Galatea ! Forefathers , help me , admit me to your kingdom or I die ! ” Cyclops followed him and hurled a rock wrenched from the mountain , and though only the farthest corner of the stone reached him , it still completely buried Acis . Then I , doing the only thing that fate allowed me , caused Acis to assume his ancestral powers . From the rock , crimson blood seeped out , and in a little while its redness began to fade , became the colour of a river at first swollen by rain , gradually clearing . Then the rock , that Polyphemus had hurled , cracked open , and a tall green reed sprang from the fissure , and the mouth of a chamber in the rock echoed with leaping waters , and ( a marvel ) suddenly a youth stood , waist - deep in the water , his fresh horns wreathed with rushes . It was Acis , except that he was larger , and his face dark blue : yet it was still Acis , changed to a river - god , and his waters still retain his former name . Galatea finished speaking and the group of Nereids went away , swimming through the placid waves . Scylla returned to the beach , not daring to trust herself to mid - ocean , and either wandered naked along the parched sand , or , when she was tired , found a remote , sheltered pool , and cooled her limbs in its enclosed waters . See , Glaucus comes , skimming the water , a new inhabitant of the sea , his form recently altered , at Anthedon opposite Euboea . Seeing the girl , he stood still , desiring her , and said whatever he thought might stop her running away . Nevertheless she ran , and , with the swiftness of fear , came to the top of a mountain standing near the shore . It faced the wide sea , rising to a single peak , its wooded summit leaning far out over the water . Here she stopped , and from a place of safety , marvelled at his colour ; the hair that hid his shoulders and covered his back ; and his groin below that merged into a winding fish ’s tail ; she not knowing whether he was god or monster . He saw her , and , leaning on a rock that stood nearby , he said : ‘
130834	131012	131013	131013	Goddess	2767	’ As the god spoke these words , looking to say more , Scylla abandoned him . Then Glaucus , maddened , and angered by her rejection , sought the wondrous halls of Circe , daughter of the Sun . Glaucus , the fisher of the swollen Euboean waters , soon left Aetna behind , that mountain piled on Typhoeus ’s giant head , and the Cyclops ’s fields , that know nothing of the plough ’s use or the harrow , and owe nothing to the yoked oxen . Zancle was left behind as well , and the walls of Rhegium opposite , and the dangerous strait , hemmed in between twin coastlines , that marks the boundary between Sicily and Italian Ausonia . From there , swimming with mighty strokes , across the Tyrrhenian Sea , he came to the grassy hills and the halls of Circe , daughter of the Sun , filled with transformed beasts . As soon as he saw her , and words of welcome had been exchanged , he said : ‘
131216	131330	131213	131213	she	1331	‘ You would do better to chase after someone whose wishes and purposes were yours , and who was captured by equal desire . Besides , you were worth courting ( and certainly could be courted ) , and if you offer any hope , believe me you will be too . If you doubt it , and have no faith in your attractions , well , I , though I am a goddess , daughter of shining Sol , though I possess such powers of herbs and charms , I promise to be yours . Spurn the spurner , repay the admirer , and , in one act , be twice revenged . ’
131339	131367	131336	131336	Glaucus	936	‘ Sooner than my love will change , Scylla unchanged , leaves will grow on the waters , and sea - weed will grow on the hills . ’
131712	132233	131700	131700	she	988	’ powers . Scylla remained where she was , and , at the first opportunity , in her hatred of Circe , robbed Ulysses of his companions . Later she would have overwhelmed the Trojan ships , if she had not previously been transformed into a rock , whose stone is visible even now : a rock that sailors still avoid . When the oarsmen of the Trojan ships had escaped Scylla , and rapacious Charybdis , when they had almost reached the Ausonian shore , the wind carried them to the coast of Libya . There Sidonian Queen Dido took Aeneas into her heart and home , she , who was fated not to endure her Phrygian husband ’s departure . She stabbed herself with his sword , on a blazing pyre , that was built as if it were intended for sacred rites , deceiving , as she had been deceived . Fleeing from the new city , Carthage , and its sandy shores , and carried back to the home of his loyal half - brother Acestes , son of Venus of Eryx , Aeneas sacrificed there , and paid honours at his dead father ’s , Anchises ’s , tomb . Then he loosed the ships , that Iris almost destroyed by fire , at Juno ’s command , and passed the Aeolian Islands , smoking with clouds of hot sulphur , the kingdom of Aeolus , son of Hippotes , and passed the rocky isle of the Sirens , the daughters of Acheloüs . Bereft of its pilot , Palinurus , he follows the coast by Inarime , Prochyte , and Pithecusae , on its barren hill , named after its inhabitants , from pithecium , a little ape . For the father of the gods , Jupiter , hating the lying and deceit of the Cercopes , and the crimes of that treacherous people , changed them into disgraceful creatures , so that , though unlike men , they should seem like them . He contracted their limbs , turned up and blunted their noses , and furrowed their faces with the wrinkles of old age . Their bodies completely covered by yellow hair , he sent them , as monkeys , to this place , but not before he had robbed them of the power of speech , and those tongues born for dreadful deceit , leaving them only the power to complain in raucous shrieks . When he had passed those islands , and left the walls of Parthenope behind him to starboard , the tomb of Misenus , the trumpeter , the son of Aeolus , was to larboard , and the shore of Cumae , a place filled with marshy sedges . He entered the cave of the Sibyl , and asked to go down to Avernus , to find his father ’s ghost . Then the Sibyl after remaining , for a long time , with her eyes gazing at the earth , lifted them , at last , filled with the frenzy of the god , and cried : ‘
132314	132431	132436	132437	a goddess	6068	’ She spoke , and pointed out to him a gleaming golden bough , in the woods of Proserpine , the Juno of Avernus , and ordered him to break it from the tree . Aeneas obeyed , and saw the power of dread Dis , and he saw his own ancestors , and the ancient shade of great - souled Anchises . He learned also the laws of those regions , and the trials he must undergo in fresh wars . Then taking the return path , with weary paces , he eased the labour by talking with his Cumean guide . As he travelled the fearful road through the shadowy twilight , he said : ‘
132516	132530	132531	132531	I	0	’ The priestess gazed at him and with a deep sigh , said : ‘
132849	132980	132988	132988	Achaemenides	1347	’ As the Sibyl spoke these words , they emerged , by the rising path , from the Stygian regions , into the city of Cumae of the Euboeans . Trojan Aeneas came to the shore that was later named after his nurse Caieta , where he carried out her funeral rites , as accepted , according to custom . This was also the place where Macareus of Neritos , a companion of sorely tried Ulysses , had settled , after the interminable weariness of hardship . Macareus now recognised Achaemenides , among the Trojans , he , who had been given up as lost , by Ulysses , long ago , among the rocks of Aetna . Astonished to discover him , unexpectedly , still alive , he asked : ‘
133038	133720	133026	133026	himself	1347	‘ If this ship is not more to me than Ithaca and my home , if I revere Aeneas less than my father , let me gaze at Polyphemus once more , with his gaping mouth dripping human blood . I can never thank Aeneas enough , even if I offered my all . Could I forget , or be ungrateful for , the fact that I speak and breathe and see the sky and the sun ’s glory ? Aeneas granted that my life did not end in the monster ’s jaws , and when I leave the light of day , now , I shall be buried in the tomb , not , indeed , in its belly . What were my feelings , then ( if fear had not robbed me of all sense and feeling ) , abandoned , seeing you making for the open sea ? I wanted to shout to you , but feared to reveal myself to the enemy . Indeed , Ulysses ’s shout nearly wrecked your vessel . I watched as Cyclops tore an enormous boulder from the mountainside , and threw it into the midst of the waves . I watched again as he hurled huge stones , as if from a catapult , using the power of his gigantic arms , and , forgetting I was not on board the ship , I was terrified that the waves and air they displaced would sink her . When you escaped by flight from certain death , Polyphemus roamed over the whole of Aetna , groaning , and groping through the woods with his hands , stumbling , bereft of his sight , among the rocks . Stretching out his arms , spattered with blood , to the sea , he cursed the Greek race like the plague , saying : “ O , if only chance would return Ulysses to me , or one of his companions , on whom I could vent my wrath , whose entrails I could eat , whose living body I could tear with my hands , whose blood could fill my gullet , and whose torn limbs could quiver between my teeth : the damage to me of my lost sight would count little or nothing then ! ” Fiercely he shouted , this and more . I was pale with fear , looking at his face still dripping with gore , his cruel hands , the empty eye - socket , his limbs and beard coated with human blood . Death was in front of my eyes , but that was still the least of evils . Now he ’ll catch me , I thought , now he ’ll merge my innards with his own , and the image stuck in my mind of the moment when I saw him hurl two of my friends against the ground , three , four times , and crouching over them like a shaggy lion , he filled his greedy jaws with flesh and entrails , bones full of white marrow , and warm limbs . Trembling seized me : I stood there , pale and downcast , watching him chew and spit out his bloody feast , vomiting up lumps of matter , mixed with wine . I imagined a like fate was being prepared for my wretched self . I hid for many days , trembling at every sound , scared of dying but longing to be dead , staving off hunger with acorns , and a mixture of leaves and grasses , alone , without help or hope , left to torture and death . After a long stretch of time , I spied this ship far off , begging them by gestures to rescue me , and ran to the shore and moved their pity : a Trojan ship received a Greek ! Now , dearest of comrades , tell me of your fortunes too , and of your leader , and the company that has entrusted itself to the sea with you . ’
133847	133851	133852	133852	Macareus	888	‘ From there , ’
133855	133904	133852	133852	Macareus	888	‘ we came to the ancient city of Lamus , of the Laestrygonians : Antiphates was now king in that land . I was sent to him with two companions . One of my friends and myself , fleeing , barely reached safety . The third reddened the Laestrygonians ’
134679	134956	134674	134674	he	1350	’ true bodies to be restored , as a wedding gift . We were sprinkled with the more virtuous juices of unknown herbs , our heads were stroked with the wand reversed , and the words , she had said , were pronounced , with the words said backwards . The more words she spoke , the more we stood erect , lifted from the ground . Our bristles fell away , our cloven hoofs lost their cleft , our shoulders reappeared , and below them were our upper and lower arms . Weeping we embraced him , as he wept himself , and clung to our leader ’s neck , and nothing was said until we had testified to our gratitude . We stayed there for a year , and , in that length of time , I saw and heard many things . Here is one told me , in secret , by one of the four female servants , dedicated to those earlier tasks . While Circe was tarrying alone with our leader , the girl showed me the statue of a young man , carved out of snow - white marble , with a woodpecker ’s head on top . It stood in a holy temple , distinguished by many wreaths . I asked , as I wished to know , who it was , and why he was worshipped in a holy temple , and why he bore a bird ’s head . She said “ Listen , Macareus , and learn , as well , how great is my mistress ’s power : keep your mind on my words ! ” ’
134957	135393	134674	134674	he	1350	‘ “ Picus , the son of Saturn , was king in the land of Ausonia , and loved horses trained for war . The hero ’s appearance was as you see it there . Though , if you looked at his beauty itself , you would approve the true and not the imaginary form . His spirit equalled his looks . In age , he had not yet seen four of the five - yearly Games at Elis in Greece . He had turned the heads of the dryads born on the hills of Latium : the nymphs of the fountains pursued him , and the naiads ; those that live in the Tiber ; and in the River Numicius ; in Anio ’s streams ; and the brief course of the Almo ; the rushing Nar ; and Farfar of dense shadows ; and those who haunt the wooded pool of Scythian Diana , and its neighbouring lakes . But , spurning them all , he loved one nymph alone , whom , it is said , Venilia once bore , on the Palatine hill , to two - faced Janus . She , when she had grown to marriageable age , was given to Picus of Laurentum , preferred of all her suitors . She was of rare beauty , but rarer her gift of song , so that she was called Canens . She could move the rocks and trees with her singing , make wild beasts gentle , halt wide rivers , and detain the wandering birds . One day when she was singing her song , with a girl ’s expressiveness , Picus left home to hunt the native wild boar , in the Laurentian fields . Astride the back of an eager mount , he carried two hunting spears in his left hand , and wore a Greek military cloak , dyed crimson , fastened with a golden brooch . Sol ’s daughter had come to those same woods , leaving the fields , called Circean from her name , to cull fresh herbs in the fertile hills . As soon as she saw the youth from the cover of a thicket , she was stunned : the herbs she had culled fell from her hand , and flames seemed to reach to her very marrow . As soon as she had recovered rational thought after the wave of passion , she wanted to own to her desires , but she could not reach him , because of his horse ’s speed , and his crowd of companions . ‘
135405	135409	134674	134674	he	1350	’ she cried , ‘
135433	135616	134674	134674	he	1350	’ Saying this , she conjured up a bodiless phantom boar , and commanded it to cross under the king ’s very eyes , and seem to enter a dense grove of trees , where the woods were thickest , and the place was impenetrable to horses . Instantly , and unwittingly , without a moment ’s delay , Picus , followed his shadowy prey , and , quickly leaping from the back of his foaming mount , he roamed , on foot , through the deep wood , chasing an empty promise . Circe recited curses , and spoke magic words , worshipping unknown gods , with unknown incantations , by which she used to dim the face of the bright moon , and veil her father ’s orb , with moisture - loving cloud . Now , also , by her song , the sky is darkened , and the earth breathes out fog , and his companions wander on blind trails , and the king ’s protection is lost . Having made the time and place , she says : ‘
135682	135697	135678	135680	daughter of Titan	5267	’ She spoke : he fiercely rejected her and her entreaties , and said : ‘
135767	135813	135764	135764	Circe	1337	‘ You will not go unpunished , or return to your Canens , and you will learn the truth of what the wounded ; a lover ; a woman , can do : and Circe is a lover ; is wounded ; is a woman ! ’
135955	135956	135964	135964	Circe	1337	’ ‘

136483	136782	136478	136478	I	0	’ Macareus had done . Aeneas ’s nurse , Caieta , was interred in a marble urn , having a brief epitaph carved on her tomb : HERE HE WHOM I , CAIETA , NURSED , WHO , NOTED FOR HIS PIETY , SAVED ME FROM ACHAEAN FIRE , AS IS RIGHT , CREMATED ME . Freeing their cables from the grassy shore , and keeping far away from the treacherous island and the home of the infamous goddess , the Trojans sought the groves where dark - shadowed Tiber , rushes , yellow with sand , to the sea . There , Aeneas won the daughter , Lavinia , and the kingdom of Latinus , son of Faunus , but not without a battle . Turnus fights with fury for his promised bride , and war is waged with a fierce people . All Etruria clashes with Latium , and for a long time , with anxious struggle , hard - fought victory is looked for . Both sides add to their strength with outside aid , and many support the Rutuli , many others the Trojan camp . Aeneas did not seek help from Evander in vain , but Venulus , sent by Turnus , had no profit from the city of exiled Diomede . He had founded a major city , Arpi , in Daunus ’s kingdom of Iapygia , and held the country given him as a dowry . When Venulus had done as Turnus commanded and asked for help , Diomede , Aetolia ’s hero , pleaded lack of resources as an excuse : he did not wish to commit himself or his father - in - law ’s people , nor had he any men of his own race he could arm . ‘
136794	136798	136799	136799	I	0	’ he said , ‘

137374	137542	137548	137548	his	5332	’ So said Diomede , grandson of Oeneus of Calydon . Venulus left that kingdom passing the Peucetian valleys , and the fields of Messapia . Here he came across a cave , dark with trees , and masked by slender reeds , that now is held by the goat - god Pan , but once was held by the nymphs . A shepherd from that region of Apulia scared them to flight , at first , suddenly inspiring terror in them . When they had collected their wits , scornful of their pursuer , they returned to their dancing , feet skipping to the measure . The shepherd mocked them , leaping wildly in imitation , and adding foul language , with coarse abuse . Nor was his mouth silent till tree - bark imprisoned his throat : he is indeed a tree : you may know its character , by the taste of its fruit that bears the mark of his speech in the wild olives ’
137695	137734	137691	137691	she	1126	‘ Turnus , you hurl those firebrands , with sacrilegious hands , in vain ! I will save : I will not allow the devouring fire to burn what was part of my woods and belongs to me . ’
138057	138273	138274	138274	You	5364	’ assistance . Now they were not seeking a kingdom as a dowry , nor a father - in - law ’s sceptre , nor you , virgin Lavinia , but to win : and they waged war because they were ashamed to surrender . At length Turnus fell , and Venus saw her son ’s weapons victorious . Ardea fell , spoken of as a power while Turnus lived . After the savage fires had destroyed it , and warm ashes buried its houses , a bird flew from the ruins , one now seen for the first time , and beat at the embers with flapping wings . Its cry , its leanness , its pallor , everything that fitted the captured city , even its name , ardea , the heron , survived in the bird : and in the beating of its wings , Ardea mourns itself . Aeneas ’s virtues had compelled all the gods , even Juno herself , to bring to an end their ancient feud , and since his young son Julus ’s fortunes were firmly founded , Cytherea ’s heroic son was ripe for heaven . Venus had sought the opinion of the gods , and throwing her arms round her father ’s neck , had said ‘
138344	138371	138329	138329	he	5367	’ The gods agreed , and Juno , the royal consort , did not display her severe expression , but consented peacefully . Then Jupiter said : ‘
138401	138744	138398	138398	you	5922	’ The word was spoken : with joy she thanked her father , and drawn by her team of doves through the clear air , she came to the coast of Laurentum , where the waters of the River Numicius , hidden by reeds , wind down to the neighbouring sea . She ordered the river - god to cleanse Aeneas , of whatever was subject to death , and bear it away , in his silent course , into the depths of the ocean . The horned god executed Venus ’s orders , and purged Aeneas of whatever was mortal , and dispersed it on the water : what was best in him remained . Once purified , his mother anointed his body with divine perfume , touched his lips with a mixture of sweet nectar and ambrosia , and made him a god , whom the Romans named Indiges , admitting him to their temples and altars . After that the Alban and Latin kingdom had both names under Ascanius . Silvius succeeded him , whose son claimed the name Latinus , with the sceptre . The famous Alba followed Latinus , and then Epytus inherited . After him came first Capys , and then Capetus . Tiberinus inherited the kingdom from them , who , drowning in the waters of that Tuscan stream , gave his name to the River Tiber . His sons were Acrota the warrior , and Remulus . The elder Remulus was killed by a lightning - bolt , when trying to portray the lightning . Acrota , more restrained than his brother , passed the sceptre to brave Aventinus , who lies buried on the very hill where he reigned , and has given his name to it , the Aventine hill . And then Proca had the rule of the Palatine people . Pomona lived in this king ’s reign . No other hamadryad , of the wood nymphs of Latium , tended the gardens more skilfully or was more devoted to the orchards ’

139222	139698	139219	139219	he	1385	‘ But if that tree stood there , unmated , without its vine , it would not be sought after for more than its leaves , and the vine also , which is joined to and rests on the elm , would lie on the ground , if it were not married to it , and leaning on it . But you are not moved by this tree ’s example , and you shun marriage , and do not care to be we d. I wish that you did ! Helen would not have had more suitors to trouble her , or Hippodamia , who caused the Lapithae problems , or Penelope , wife of that Ulysses , who was delayed too long at the war . Even now a thousand men want you , and the demi - gods and the gods , and the divinities that haunt the Alban hills , though you shun them and turn away from their wooing . But if you are wise , if you want to marry well , and listen to this old woman , that loves you more than you think , more than them all , reject their vulgar offers , and choose Vertumnus to share your bed ! You have my assurance as well : he is not better known to himself than he is to me : he does not wander here and there in the wide world : he lives on his own in this place : and he does not love the latest girl he has seen , as most of your suitors do . You will be his first love , and you will be his last , and he will devote his life only to you . And then he is young , is blessed with natural charm , can take on a fitting appearance , and whatever is ordered , though you ask all , he will do . Besides , that which you love the same , those apples you cherish , he is the first to have , and with joy holds your gifts in his hand ! But he does not desire now the fruit of your trees , or the sweet juice of your herbs : he desires nothing but you . Take pity on his ardour , and believe that he , who seeks you , is begging you , in person , through my mouth . Fear the vengeful gods , and Idalian Venus , who hates the hard - hearted , and Rhamnusian Nemesis , her inexorable wrath ! That you may fear them more ( since my long life has given me knowledge of many tales ) I will tell you a story , famous through all of Cyprus , by which you might easily be swayed and softened . ’
139699	140537	139219	139219	he	1385	‘ Once , Iphis , a youth , born of humble stock , saw noble Anaxarete , of the blood of Teucer , saw her , and felt the fire of passion in every bone . He fought it for a long time , but when he could not conquer his madness by reason , he came begging at her threshold . Now he would confess his sorry love to her nurse , asking her not to be hard on him , by the hopes she had for her darling . At other times he flattered each of her many attendants , with enticing words , seeking their favourable disposition . Often he gave them messages to carry to her , in the form of fawning letters . Sometimes he hung garlands on her doorpost wet with his tears , and lay with his soft flank on the hard threshold , complaining at the pitiless bolts barring the way . But she spurned , and mocked , him , crueler than the surging sea , when the Kids set ; harder than steel tempered in the fires of Noricum ; or natural rock still rooted to its bed . And she added proud , insolent words to harsh actions , robbing her lover of hope , as well . Unable to endure the pain of his long torment , Iphis spoke these last words before her door . “ You have conquered , Anaxarete , and you will not have to suffer any tedium on my account . Devise glad triumphs , and sing the Paean of victory , and wreathe your brow with shining laurel ! You have conquered , and I die gladly : now , heart of steel , rejoice ! Now you will have something to praise about my love , something that pleases you . Remember that my love for you did not end before life itself , and that I lose twin lights in one . No mere rumour will come to you to announce my death : have no doubt , I myself will be there , visibly present , so you can feast your savage eyes on my lifeless corpse . Yet , if you , O gods , see what mortals do , let me be remembered ( my tongue can bear to ask for nothing more ) , and suffer my tale to be told , in future ages , and grant , to my fame , the years , you have taken from my life . ” He spoke , and lifted his tear - filled eyes to the doorposts he had often crowned with flowery garlands , and , raising his pale arms to them , tied a rope to the cross - beam , saying : “ This wreath will please you , cruel and wicked , as you are ! ” Then he thrust his head in the noose , though , as he hung there , a pitiful burden , his windpipe crushed , even then he turned towards her . The drumming of his feet seemed to sound a request to enter , and when the door was opened it revealed what he had done . The servants shrieked , and lifted him down , but in vain . Then they carried his body to his mother ’s house ( since his father was dead ) . She took him to her breast , and embraced her son ’s cold limbs , and when she had said all the words a distraught father could say , and done the things distraught mothers do , weeping , she led his funeral procession through the heart of the city , carrying the pallid corpse , on a bier , to the pyre . The sound of mourning rose to the ears of stony - hearted Anaxarete , her house chancing to be near the street , where the sad procession passed . Now a vengeful god roused her . Still , she was roused , and said : “ Let us see this miserable funeral ” and went to a rooftop room with open windows . She had barely looked at Iphis , lying on the bier , when her eyes grew fixed , and the warm blood left her pallid body . Trying to step backwards she was rooted : trying to turn her face away , also , she could not . Gradually the stone that had long existed in her heart possessed her body . If you think this is only a tale , Salamis still preserves the image of the lady as a statue , and also possesses a temple of Gazing Venus . Remember all this , O nymph of mine : put aside , I beg you , reluctant pride , and yield to your lover . Then the frost will not sear your apples in the bud , nor the storm winds scatter them in flower . ’
141079	141170	141062	141062	Mars	635	‘ The time has come , lord , to grant the reward ( that you promised to me and your deserving grandson ) , since the Roman state is strong , on firm foundations , and does not depend on a single champion : free his spirit , and raising him from earth set him in the heavens . You once said to me , in person , at a council of the gods ( since I am mindful of the gracious words I noted in my retentive mind ) , ‘
141183	141192	141193	141194	Omnipotent Jupiter	1396	’ Let your words be ratified in full ! ’
141396	141463	141464	141464	Iris	512	‘ O lady , glory of the Latin and Sabine peoples , worthy before to have been the wife of so great a hero , and now of Quirinus , dry your tears , and if it is your desire to see your husband , follow me and seek the grove , that flourishes on the Quirinal hill and shades the temple of Rome ’s king . ’
141496	141560	141485	141485	She	512	‘ O goddess ( since it is not easy for me to say who you are , but it is clear you are a goddess ) , lead on : O , lead on , and show me my husband ’s face . If only the fates allow me to see him once , I shall declare I have been received in heaven . ’
141770	141841	141758	141766	the older inhabitants , not ignorant of the past	5450	‘ They say that Hercules , Jupiter ’s son , back from the sea with the rich herds of Spain , happily came to the shore of Lacinium , and while his cattle strayed through the tender grass , he entered the house of the great Croton , a not inhospitable roof , and refreshed himself with rest , after his long labours , and , in leaving , said : ‘
141858	141909	141758	141766	the older inhabitants , not ignorant of the past	5450	’ And the promise proved true , since there was one Myscelus , the son of Alemon of Argos , dearest to the gods of all his generation . Hercules , the club - bearer , leaning over him , spoke to him as he lay in a deep sleep : ‘
141929	142141	142143	142143	you	5456	’ and he threatened him with many and fearful things if he did not obey . Then the god and sleep vanished together . Alemon ’s son rose , and , in silence , thought over the vision , fresh in his mind . He struggled in himself for a long time over the decision : the god ordered him to go : the law prohibited his going . Death was the penalty for the man who wished to change his nationality . Bright Sol had hidden his shining face in Ocean ’s stream , and Night had lifted her starriest face : the same god seemed to appear to him , to admonish him in the same way , and warn of worse and greater punishment if he did not obey . He was afraid , and prepared , at once , to transfer the sanctuary of his ancestors to a new place . There was talk in the city , and he was brought to trial , for showing contempt for the law . When the case against him had been presented , and it was evident the charge was proven , without needing witnesses , the wretched defendant , lifting his face and hands to heaven , cried : ‘
142171	142618	142163	142163	you	5456	’ The ancient custom was to vote using black and white pebbles : the black to condemn : the white to absolve from punishment . Now , also , the harsh verdict was determined in this way , and every pebble dropped into the pitiless urn was black : but when the urn was tipped over and the pebbles poured out for the count , their colour had changed from black to white , and , acquitted through the divine power of Hercules , Alemon ’s son was freed . He first gave thanks to that son of Amphitryon , his patron , and with favouring winds set sail on the Ionian Sea . He sailed by Neretum , of the Sallentines , Sybaris , and the Spartan colony of Tarentum , the bay of Siris , Crimisa , and the Iapygian fields . He had barely passed the lands that overlook those seas , when he came , by destiny , to the mouth of the river Aesar , and near it the tumulus beneath which the earth covered the sacred bones of Croton . He founded the city of Crotona there , in the land commanded by the god , and derived the name of the city from him , whom the tumulus held . Such were the established beginnings , according to reliable tradition , of that place , and the cause of the city ’s being sited on Italian soil . There was a man here , Pythagoras , a Samian by birth , who had fled Samos and its rulers , and , hating their tyranny , was living in voluntary exile . Though the gods were far away , he visited their region of the sky , in his mind , and what nature denied to human vision he enjoyed with his inner eye . When he had considered every subject through concentrated thought , he communicated it widely in public teaching the silent crowds , who listened in wonder to his words , concerning the origin of the vast universe , and of the causes of things ; and what the physical world is ; what the gods are ; where the snows arise ; what the origin of lightning is ; whether Jupiter , or the storm - winds , thunder from colliding clouds ; what shakes the earth ; by what laws the stars move ; and whatever else is hidden ; and he was the first to denounce the serving of animal flesh at table ; the first voice , wise but not believed in , to say , for example , in words like these : ‘
143414	143415	143390	143390	you	1489	’ ‘
143822	143823	143796	143796	I	0	’ ‘
143960	144110	143956	143956	You	5501	’ traverses tend towards day , and brilliant light follow the dark of night . The sky has a different colour when all weary things are at rest , at midnight , than when bright Lucifer appears on his white charger , and alters again when Aurora , herald of the dawn , stains the world she bequeaths to Phoebus . The shield of the god himself is red , when it rises from beneath the earth , and still red , when it is hidden below the earth , again : but is white at the zenith , because there the atmosphere is purer , and it escapes far from the contagion of earth . And Diana , the moon , can never have the same or similar form , and is always less today than tomorrow if her orb is waxing , greater if it is waning . ’
144111	144542	143956	143956	You	5501	‘ Do you not see that the year displays four aspects , passing through them , in a semblance of our life ? For spring , in its new life , is tender and sap - filled , and like a child : then the shoots are fresh and growing , delicate , without substance , quickening the farmer ’s hopes . Then everything blossoms , the kindly land is a riot of brightly coloured flowers , but the leaves are still not strong . From spring , the year , grown stronger , moves to summer , and becomes a powerful man : no season is sturdier , or more expansive , than this , or shines more richly . Autumn comes , when the ardour of youth has gone , ripe and mellow , between youth and age , a scattering of grey on its forehead . Then trembling winter , with faltering steps , its hair despoiled , or , what it has , turned white . And our bodies themselves are always , restlessly , changing : we shall not be , tomorrow , what we were , or what we are . There was a time when we were hidden in our first mother ’s womb , only the seed and promise of a human being : nature applied her skilful hands , and , unwilling for our bodies to be buried , cramped in our mother ’s swollen belly , expelled us from our home , into the empty air . Born into the light , the infant lay there , powerless : but soon it scrambled on all fours like a wild creature , then , gradually , helped by a supporting harness , it stood , uncertainly , on shaky legs . From that point , it grew strong and swift , and passed through its span of youth . When the middle years are also done , life takes the downward path of declining age . Milon , the athlete , grown old , cries when he looks at those weak and flabby arms that were once like those of Hercules , a solid mass of muscle . Helen , the daughter of Tyndareus , also weeps , when she sees an old woman ’s wrinkles in the glass , and asks why she has been twice ravaged . Devouring Time , and you , jealous Age , consume everything , and slowly gnawing at them , with your teeth , little by little , consign all things to eternal death ! ’
144543	144774	143956	143956	You	5501	‘ Even the things we call elements do not persist . Apply your concentration , and I will teach the changes they pass through . The everlasting universe contains four generative states of matter . Of these , two , earth and water , are heavy , and sink lower , under their own weight . The other two lack heaviness , and , if not held down , they seek height : that is air , and fire , purer than air . Though they are distinct in space , nevertheless they are all derived from one another , and resolve into one another . Earth , melting , is dilated to clear water : the moisture , rarified , changes to wind and air : then air , losing further weight , in the highest regions shines out as fire , the most rarified of all . Then they return , in reverse , revealing the same series of changes . Since fire , condenses , turns into denser air , and this to water , and water , contracted , solidifies as earth . Nothing keeps its own form , and Nature , the renewer of things , refreshes one shape from another . Believe me , nothing dies in the universe as a whole , but it varies and changes its aspect , and what we call ‘
144777	144794	143956	143956	You	5501	’ is a beginning to be , of something other , than what was before , and ‘
144796	144808	143956	143956	You	5501	’ is , likewise , ending a former state . Though , ‘
144810	144817	143956	143956	You	5501	’ perhaps is transferred here , and ‘
144819	145378	143956	143956	You	5501	’ , there , the total sum is constant . For my part , I would have thought that nothing lasts for long with the same appearance . So the ages changed from gold to iron , and so the fortunes of places have altered . I have seen myself what was once firm land become the sea : I have seen earth made from the waters : and seashells lie far away from the ocean , and an ancient anchor has been found on a mountaintop . The down rush of waters has made what was once a plain into a valley , and hills , by the deluge have been washed to the sea . Marshy land has drained to parched sand , and what was once thirsty ground filled with a marshy pool . Here , Nature generates fresh springs , and there seals them up , and rivers , released by deep earthquakes , burst out or dry up , and sink . So when the Lycus is swallowed by a chasm in the earth , it emerges far off , reborn , from a different source . So , engulfed , flowing as a hidden stream , the mighty Erasinus emerges again , in the fields of Argos . And they say that Mysus , ashamed of its origin and its former banks , now flows elsewhere , as Caicus . Amenanus flows sometimes churning Sicilian sands , at other times dried up , its fountains blocked . Anigrus , once drinkable , now flows with water you would not wish to touch , since , unless we deny all credence to the poets , the bi - formed centaurs washed their wounds there , dealt by the bow of club - bearing Hercules . Is the Hypanis , born in the Scythian mountains , not ruined by bitter saltwater , that once was sweet ? Antissa , and Pharos , and Phoenician Tyre , were surrounded by sea : of which not one , now , is an island . The former settlers of Leucas lived on a peninsula : now the waves encircle it . Zancle also is said to have been joined to Italy , till the waves washed away the boundary , and the deep sea pushed back the land . If you look for Helice and Buris , cities of Achaia , you will find them under the waters , and sailors are accustomed , even now , to point out the submerged towns with their sunken walls . There is a mound near Troezen , where Pittheus ruled , steep and treeless , that once was the flattest open space on the plain , and now is a mound . For ( strange to relate ) the wild strength of the winds , imprisoned in dark caves , longing for somewhere to breathe , and struggling in vain to enjoy the freer expanses of sky , since there was no gap at all in their prison , as an exit for their breath , extended and swelled the ground , just as a man inflates a bladder , or a goatskin taken from a twin - horned goat . The swelling remained there , and has the look of a high hill , solidified by long centuries . ’
145379	145767	145774	145774	their	5502	‘ Though many instances I have heard and known of , come to mind , I shall relate only a few more . Does not water , also , offer and receive new forms ? Your stream , horned Ammon , is chill at mid - day , and warm in the morning and evening , and they tell of the Athamanians setting fire to wood by pouring your waters over it , when the moon wanes to her smallest crescent . The Cicones have a river , whose waters when drunk turn the vital organs to stone , and that change things to marble when touched . The Crathis , and the Sybaris , here , near our own country , make hair like amber or gold : and what is more amazing , there are streams that have power to change not merely the body but the mind as well . Who has not heard of the disgusting waves of Salmacis , and the Aethiopian lakes ? Whoever wets his throat with these , is either maddened , or falls into a strange , deep sleep . Whoever slakes his thirst at Clitor ’s fountain , shuns wine , and only enjoys pure water , whether it is due to a power in the water that counteracts hot wine , or whether , as the natives claim , Melampus , Amythaon ’s son , when he had saved the demented daughters of Proetus from madness , by herbs and incantations , threw the remnants of what had purged their minds into its springs , and the antipathy to wine was left behind in its waters . The flow of the River Lyncestius has the opposite effect , so that whoever drinks even moderately of it , stumbles about , as if they had drunk pure wine . There is a place in Arcadia , the ancients called Pheneus , mistrusted for its dual - natured waters : beware of them at night , drunk at night they are harmful : in the day they can be drunk without harm . So , rivers and lakes can harbour some power or other . There was a time when Ortygia floated on the waves , now it is fixed , and the Argo ’s crew feared the Symphlegades ’

Blessed with a nymph , Egeria , for wife , and guided by the Muses , he taught the sacred rituals , and educated a savage , warlike , race in the arts of peace . When , in old age , he relinquished his sceptre with his life , the women of Latium , the populace , and the senators wept for the dead Numa : but Egeria , his wife , left the city , and lived in retirement , concealed by dense woods , in the valley of Aricia , and her sighs and lamentations prevented the worship of Oresteian Diana . O ! How often the nymphs of the lakes and groves admonished her to stop , and spoke words of consolation to her ! How often Hippolytus , Theseus ’s heroic son , said to the weeping nymph : ‘
147752	148003	147751	147751	others	5836	’ like misfortunes : you will endure your own more calmly . I wish my own case had no power to lighten your sorrow ! But even mine can . If your ears have heard anything of Hippolytus , of how , through his father ’s credulity , and the deceits of his accursed stepmother , he met his death , though you will be amazed , and I will prove it with difficulty , nevertheless , I am he . Phaedra , Pasiphaë ’s daughter , having tried , vainly , to tempt me to dishonour my father ’s bed , deflected guilt , and , ( more through fear than anger at being rejected ? ) , made out I had wanted what she wished , and so accused me . Not in the least deserving it , I was banished by my father from the city , and called down hostile curses on my head . Exiled , I headed my chariot towards Troezen , Pittheus ’s city , and was travelling the Isthmus , near Corinth , when the sea rose , and a huge mass of water shaped itself into a mountain , and seemed to grow , and give out bellowings , splitting at the summit : from it , a horned bull , emerged , out of the bursting waters , standing up to his chest in the gentle breeze , expelling quantities of seawater from his nostrils and gaping mouth .

I was thrown from the chariot , and , my body entangled in the reins , my sinews caught by the tree , you might have seen my living entrails dragged along , my limbs partly torn away , partly held fast , my bones snapped with a loud crack , and my weary spirit expiring : no part of my body recognisable : but all one wound . Now can you compare your tragedy , or dare you , nymph , with mine ? I saw , also , the kingdom without light , and bathed my lacerated body in Phlegethon ’s waves : there still , if Apollo ’s son , Aesculapius , had not restored me to life with his powerful cures . When , despite Dis ’s anger , I regained it , by the power of herbs and Paean ’s help , Cynthia , created a dense mist round me , so that I might not be seen and increase envy at the gift . And she added a look of age , and left me unrecognisable , so that I would be safe , and might be seen with impunity . She considered , for a while , whether to give me Crete or Delos to live in : abandoning Delos and Crete , she set me down here , and ordered me to discard my name that might remind me of horses , and said : “ You , who were Hippolytus , be also , now , Virbius ! ” Since then I have lived in this grove , one of the minor deities , and sheltering in the divinity of Diana , my mistress , I am coupled with her . ’

Then in truth Cytherean Venus struck her breast with both hands , and tried to hide Caesar in a cloud , as Paris was once snatched from the attack of Atrides , and Aeneas escaped Diomede ’s sword . Then Jupiter , the father , spoke : ‘

152065	152524	152530	152530	I	0	’ He had barely finished , when gentle Venus stood in the midst of the Senate , seen by no one , and took up the newly freed spirit of her Caesar from his body , and preventing it from vanishing into the air , carried it towards the glorious stars . As she carried it , she felt it glow and take fire , and loosed it from her breast : it climbed higher than the moon , and drawing behind it a fiery tail , shone as a star . Seeing his son ’s good works , Caesar acknowledges they are greater than his own , and delights in being surpassed by him . Though the son forbids his own actions being honoured above his father ’s , nevertheless fame , free and obedient to no one ’s orders , exalts him , despite himself , and denies him in this one thing .

Jupiter commands the heavenly citadels , and the kingdoms of the threefold universe . Earth is ruled by Augustus . Each is a father and a master . You gods , the friends of Aeneas , to whom fire and sword gave way ; you deities of Italy ; and Romulus , founder of our city ; and Mars , father of Romulus ; Vesta , Diana , sacred among Caesar ’s ancestral gods , and you , Phoebus , sharing the temple with Caesar ’s Vesta ; you , Jupiter who hold the high Tarpeian citadel ; and all you other gods , whom it is fitting and holy for a poet to invoke , I beg that the day be slow to arrive , and beyond our own lifetimes , when Augustus shall rise to heaven , leaving the world he rules , and there , far off , shall listen , with favour , to our prayers ! And now the work is done , that Jupiter ’s anger , fire or sword can not erase , nor the gnawing tooth of time . Let that day , that only has power over my body , end when it will , my uncertain span of years : yet the best part of me will be borne , immortal , beyond the distant stars . Wherever Rome ’s influence extends , over the lands it has civilized , I will be spoken , on people ’s lips : and , famous through all the ages , if there is truth in poets ’
