168	1008	1009	1009	She	116	‘ Medea , you struggle in vain : some god , I do not know which , opposes you . I wonder if this , or something , like this , is what people indeed call love ? Or why would the tasks my father demands of Jason seem so hard ? They are more than hard ! Why am I afraid of his death , when I have scarcely seen him ? What is the cause of all this fear ? Quench , if you can , unhappy girl , these flames that you feel in your virgin heart ! If I could , I would be wiser ! But a strange power draws me to him against my will . Love urges one thing : reason another . I see , and I desire the better : I follow the worse . Why do you burn for a stranger , royal virgin , and dream of marriage in an alien land ? This earth can also give you what you can love . Whether he lives or dies , is in the hands of the gods . Let him live ! I can pray for this even if I may not love him : what is Jason guilty of ? Who , but the heartless , would not be touched by Jason ’s youth , and birth , and courage ? Who , though the other qualities were absent , could not be stirred by his beauty ? He has stirred my heart , indeed . And unless I offer my help , he will feel the fiery breath of the bronze - footed bulls ; have to meet that enemy , sprung from the soil , born of his own sowing ; or be given as captured prey to the dragon ’s greed . If I allow this , then I am born of the tigress : then I show I have a heart of stone and iron ! Why can I not watch him die , and shame my eyes by seeing ? Why do I not urge the bulls on , to meet him , and the wild earth - born warriors , and the unsleeping dragon ? Let the gods also desire the better ! Though it is not for me to pray for , but to bring about . Shall I betray my father ’s country ? Shall some unknown be saved by my powers , and unhurt because of me , without me , set his sails to the wind , and be husband to another , leaving Medea to be punished ? If he could do that , if he could set another woman above me , let him die , the ungrateful man ! But his look , his nobility of spirit , and his graceful form , do not make me fear deceit or forgetfulness of my kindness . And he will give me his word beforehand , and I will gather the gods to witness our pledge . Why fear when it is certain ? Prepare yourself , and dispel all delay : Jason will be for ever in your debt , take you to himself in sacred marriage , and through the cities of Pelasgian Greece , the crowds of women will glorify you as his saviour . Carried by the winds , shall I leave my native country , my sister , my brother , my father , and my gods ? Well then , my father is barbarous , and my country is savage , and my brother is still a child : my sister ’s prayers are for me , and the greatest god is within ! I will not be leaving greatness behind , but pursuing greatness : honour as a saviour of these Achaean people , familiarity with a better land and with cities whose fame is flourishing even here , the culture and arts of those places , and the man , the son of Aeson , for whom I would barter those things that the wide world owns , joined to whom I will be called fortunate , dear to the gods , and my head will be crowned with the stars . What of the stories of mountains that clash together in mid - ocean , and Charybdis the bane of sailors , now sucking in , now spewing out the sea , and rapacious dog - headed Scylla , yelping over the Sicilian deeps ? Well , holding what I love , clinging to Jason ’s breast , I shall be carried over the wide seas : in his arms , I will fear nothing , or if I am afraid , I will only be afraid for him . But do you call that marriage , Medea , and clothe your fault with fair names ? Consider instead , how great a sin you are near to , and while you can , shun the crime ! ’
1269	1306	1307	1307	He	124	‘ I see what I am doing : it is not ignorance of the truth that ensnares me , but love . Your salvation is in my gift , but being saved , remember your promise ! ’
1773	2135	2184	2184	Jason	51	’ faces fell in fear , and their courage failed them , when they saw these warriors preparing to hurl their sharp spears , at the head of the Haemonian hero . She also , who had rendered him safe , was afraid . When she saw the solitary youth attacked by so many enemies , she grew pale , and sat there , suddenly cold and bloodless . And in case the herbs she had given him had not been potent enough , she chanted a spell to support them , and called on her secret arts . He threw a boulder into the midst of his enemies , and this turned their attack , on him , against themselves . The earth - born brothers died at each other ’s hands , and fell as in civil war . The Achaeans cheered , and clung to the victor , and hugged him in eager embraces . You also , princess among the Barbarians , longed to hold the victorious man : but modesty prevented it . Still , you might have held him , but concern for your reputation stopped you from doing so . What you might fittingly do you did , rejoicing silently , giving thanks , for your incantations , and the gods who inspired them . The final task was to put the dragon to sleep with the magic drugs . Known for its crest , its triple tongues and curved fangs , it was the dread guardian of the tree ’s gold . But when Jason had sprinkled it with the Lethean juice of a certain herb , and three times repeated the words that bring tranquil sleep , that calm the rough seas and turbulent rivers , sleep came to those sleepless eyes , and the heroic son of Aeson gained the Golden Fleece . Proud of his prize , and taking with him a further prize , the one who had helped him gain it , the hero , and his wife Medea , returned to the harbour at Iolchos . The elderly Haemonian mothers and fathers bring offerings to mark their sons ’
2190	2254	2184	2184	Jason	51	‘ O my wife , to whom I confess I owe my life , though you have already given me everything , and the total of all your kindnesses is beyond any promises we made , let your incantations , if they can ( what indeed can they not do ? ) reduce my own years and add them to my father ’s ! ’
2298	2393	2296	2296	she	53	‘ Husband , what dreadful words have escaped your lips ? Do you think I can transfer any part of your life to another ? Hecate would not allow it : nor is yours a just request . But I will try to grant a greater gift than the one you ask for , Jason . If only the Triple Goddess will aid me , and give her assent in person to this great act of daring , I will attempt to renew your father ’s length of years , without need for yours . ’
2550	2593	2512	2512	she	53	‘ Night , most faithful keeper of our secret rites ; Stars , that , with the golden moon , succeed the fires of light ; Triple Hecate , you who know all our undertakings , and come , to aid the witches ’
2802	2921	2930	2930	her	64	’ hot flame for me : force their necks to bow , beneath the heavy yoke , that never pulled the curving plough : You turn the savage warfare , born of the serpent ’s teeth , against itself , and lull the watcher , innocent of sleep ; that guard deceived , bring golden spoil , to the towns of Greece . Now I need the juice by which old age may be renewed , that can regain the prime of years , return the flower of youth , and You will grant it . Not in vain , stars glittered in reply : not in vain , winged dragons bring my chariot , through the sky . ’
2941	4038	2934	2934	she	64	’ bridled necks , and shaken the light reins in her hands , she was snatched up on high . She looked down on Thessalian Tempe far below , and sent the dragons to certain places that she knew . She considered those herbs that grow on Mount Ossa , those of Mount Pelion , Othrys and Pindus , and higher Olympus , and of those that pleased her , plucked some by the roots , and cut others , with a curved pruning - knife of bronze . Many she chose , as well , from the banks of the Apidanus . Many she chose , as well , from the Amphrysus . Nor did she omit the Enipeus . Peneus , and Spercheus ’s waters gave something , and the reedy shores of Boebe . And at Anthedon , by Euboea , she picked a plant of long life , not yet famous for the change it made in Glaucus ’s body . Then she returned , after nine days and nine nights surveying all the lands she had crossed , from her chariot , drawn by the winged dragons . The dragons had only smelt the herbs , yet they shed their skins of many years . Reaching her door and threshold , she stopped on the outside , and under the open sky , avoiding contact with any man , she set up two altars of turf , one on the right to Hecate , one on the left to Youth . She wreathed them with sacred boughs from the wildwood , then dug two trenches near by in the earth , and performed the sacrifice , plunging her knife into the throat of a black - fleeced sheep , and drenching the wide ditches with blood . She poured over it cups of pure honey , and again she poured over it cups of warm milk , uttering words as she did so , calling on the spirits of the earth , and begging the shadowy king and his stolen bride , not to be too quick to steal life from the old man ’s limbs . When she had appeased the gods by prayer and murmured a while , she ordered Aeson ’s exhausted body to be carried into the air , and freeing him to deep sleep with her spells , she stretched him out like a corpse on a bed of herbs . She ordered Jason , his son , to go far off , and the attendants to go far off , and warned them to keep profane eyes away from the mysteries . They went as she had ordered . Medea , with streaming hair , circled the burning altars , like a Bacchante , and dipping many - branched torches into the black ditches filled with blood , she lit them , once they were darkened , at the twin altars . Three times with fire , three times with water , three times with sulphur , she purified the old man . Meanwhile a potent mixture is heating in a bronze cauldron set on the flames , bubbling , and seething , white with turbulent froth . She boils there , roots dug from a Thessalian valley , seeds , flowerheads , and dark juices . She throws in precious stones searched for in the distant east , and sands that the ebbing tide of ocean washes . She adds hoar - frost collected by night under the moon , the wings and flesh of a vile screech - owl , and the slavering foam of a sacrificed were - wolf , that can change its savage features to those of a man . She does not forget the scaly skin of a thin Cinyphian water - snake , the liver of a long - lived stag , the eggs and the head of a crow that has lived for nine human life - times . With these , and a thousand other nameless things , the barbarian witch pursued her greater than mortal purpose . She stirred it all with a long - dry branch of a fruitful olive , mixing the depths with the surface . Look ! The ancient staff turned in the hot cauldron , first grew green again , then in a short time sprouted leaves , and was , suddenly , heavily loaded with olives . And whenever the flames caused froth to spatter from the hollow bronze , and warm drops to fall on the earth , the soil blossomed , and flowers and soft grasses grew . As soon as she saw this , Medea unsheathed a knife , and cut the old man ’s throat , and letting the old blood out , filled the dry veins with the juice . When Aeson had absorbed it , part through his mouth , and part through the wound , the white of his hair and beard quickly vanished , and a dark colour took its place . At a stroke his leanness went , and his pallor and dullness of mind . The deep hollows were filled with rounded flesh , and his limbs expanded . Aeson marvelled , recalling that this was his self of forty years ago . Bacchus saw this wondrous miracle from heaven ’s heights , and realising from it , that the Nymphs of Mount Nysa , who had nursed him , could have their youth restored , he secured that gift from the witch of Colchis . There was no end to her magic . Phasian Medea , pretending to a sham quarrel with her husband , fled as a suppliant to Pelias ’s threshold , he who had usurped Aeson ’s throne . There , the king ’s daughters received her , since he himself was weighed down by the years . The lying Colchian soon won them over by a skilful show of friendship , and when she told them of one of her greatest gifts , the removal of Aeson ’s many years , and lingered over it , hope was aroused in Pelias ’s daughters that similar magic arts might rejuvenate their father . They begged her , and told her to set a price however great . She was silent for a moment , and appeared to hesitate , keeping the minds of her petitioners in suspense by a show of solemn pretence . When , eventually , she promised to do it , she said ‘
4072	4316	4319	4319	you	171	’ Straight away the woolly creature , worn out by innumerable years , was dragged forward , his horns curving round his hollow temples . When the witch had cut his wizened throat with her Thessalian knife , hardly staining the blade with blood , she immersed the sheep ’s carcass in the bronze cauldron , along with her powerful magic herbs . These shrank its limbs , melted away its horns , and , with its horns , the years . A high - pitched bleating came from inside the vessel , and while they were wondering at the bleating , a lamb leapt out , and frisked away , seeking the udder and milk . Pelias ’s daughters were stunned , and now the truth of her promise had been displayed , they insisted even more eagerly . Three times Phoebus had unyoked his horses , after their plunge into the western ocean , and on the fourth night the stars were glittering in all their radiance , when the deceitful daughter of Aeetes set clear water , and herbs , but ineffectual ones , over a blazing fire . And now the king and his guards also were deep in death - like sleep , achieved by her incantations and the power of her magic spells . The king ’s daughters , at her command , crossed the threshold , with the Colchian witch , and stood around his bed . ‘
4325	4329	4319	4319	you	171	’ she said . ‘
4409	4508	4509	4509	Daughters	174	’ Urged on by these words , the more love each had for him , the quicker she was to act without love , and did evil , to avoid greater evil . Nevertheless they could not bear to see their own blows , and turned their eyes away , and with averted faces , wounded him blindly with cruel hands . Streaming blood , the old man still raised himself on his elbow , and , though mutilated , tried to rise from his bed . Stretching his pallid hands out among the many weapons , he cried ‘
4530	4943	4944	4944	You	176	’ Their strength and courage vanished . But as he was about to utter more words , the Colchian witch cut his throat , and plunged his torn body into the seething water . She would not have escaped punishment had she not taken to the air , with her winged dragons . Through the high sky , clockwise , she fled , over the shadowy slopes of Pelion , Chiron ’s home ; over Othrys and the places made famous by the ancient fate of Cerambus , who , aided by the nymphs and changed to a winged scarab beetle , lifted into the air , when the all - powerful sea drowned the solid earth , and so escaped un - drowned from Deucalion ’s flood . She passed Aeolian Pitane on the left , with its huge stone serpent image , and Ida ’s grove where Liber concealed , in the deceptive shape of a stag , the bullock stolen by his son . She passed the place where the father of Corythus , Paris , lay , buried under a little sand ; and where Hecuba , changed to a black bitch of Hecate , Maera , spread terror through the fields with her strange barking . She flew over Astypalaea , the city of Eurypylus , where the women of the island , of Cos , acquired horns when they abused Hercules , as he and his company departed : over Rhodes , beloved of Phoebus : and the Telchines of the city of Ialysos on Rhodes , whose eyes corrupted everything they looked on , so that Jupiter , disgusted with them , sank them under his brother ’s ocean waves . She passed the walls of ancient Carthaea , on the island of Ceos , where Alcidamas , as a father , would marvel , one day , that a peace - loving dove could spring from the body of his daughter , Ctesylla . Then she saw Lake Hyrie , and Cycnean Tempe , made famous suddenly by a swan . There Phylius , at the boy Cycnus ’s command , brought him birds and a fierce lion he had tamed . Ordered to overcome a wild bull as well , he did overcome him , but angry that his love was rejected so often , he refused to grant this last gift of a bull , when asked . Cycnus , angered , said ‘
4949	5528	5542	5543	the father	179	’ and leapt from a high cliff . All thought he had fallen , but changed to a swan he beat through the air on white wings , though his mother , Hyrie , not knowing he was safe , pined away with weeping , and became the lake that carries her name . Near there was the city of Pleuron , where Combe the daughter of Ophius , on flickering wings , escaped death at the hands of her sons , the Aetolian Curetes . And then Medea looked down at the fields of Calaurea ’s isle , sacred to Leto , whose king and queen were also changed to birds . On her right was Cyllene , where Menephron lay with his mother , as though he were a wild beast . Further on she sees the Cephisus , the river - god lamenting his grandson ’s fate , changed by Apollo into a lumbering seal , and the home of Eumelus , mourning his son Botres , reborn as a bird , the bee - eater , in the air . At last , the dragon ’s wings brought her to Corinth , the ancient Ephyre , and its Pirenian spring . Here , tradition says , that in earliest times , human bodies sprang from fungi , swollen by rain . After Jason ’s new bride Glauce had been consumed by the fires of vengeful Colchian witchcraft and both the Isthmus ’s gulfs had witnessed flame consuming the king ’s palace , Medea impiously bathed her sword in the blood of their sons . Then , after performing this evil act , she fled from Jason ’s wrath . Carried by her dragons that are born of the Titans , she reached Pallas ’s citadel of Athens . This once knew you Phene , the most righteous , and you old Periphas , both flying in the air , as birds , the eagle and the osprey : and Alcyone , granddaughter of Polypemon , resting on strange new wings . It was Aegeus who gave Medea sanctuary there , damned thereafter by that one action : and not content with taking her in , he even entered into a contract of marriage with her . Now Theseus came to Athens , Aegeus ’s son , but as yet unknown to him . He , by his courage , had brought peace to the Isthmus between the two gulfs . Medea , seeking his destruction , prepared a mixture of poisonous aconite , she had brought with her from the coast of Scythia . This poison is said to have dripped from the teeth of Cerberus , the Echidnean dog . There is a dark cavern with a gaping mouth , and a path into the depths , up which Hercules , hero of Tiryns , dragged the dog , tied with steel chains , resisting and twisting its eyes away from the daylight and the shining rays . Cerberus , provoked to a rabid frenzy , filled all the air with his simultaneous three - headed howling , and spattered the green fields with white flecks of foam . These are supposed to have congealed and found food to multiply , gaining harmful strength from the rich soil . Because they are long - lived , springing from the hard rock , the country people call these shoots , of wolf - bane , ‘
