72	85	86	86	she	19	‘ I was one of the nymphs , that lived in Achaia , ’
88	352	86	86	she	19	‘ none of them keener to travel the woodland , none of them keener to set out the nets . But , though I never sought fame for my beauty , though I was wiry , my name was , the beautiful . Nor did my looks , praised too often , give me delight . I blushed like a simpleton at the gifts of my body , those things that other girls used to rejoice in . I thought it was sinful to please . Tired ( I remember ) , I was returning , from the Stymphalian woods . It was hot , and my efforts had doubled the heat . I came to a river , without a ripple , hurrying on without a murmur , clear to its bed , in whose depths you could count every pebble : you would scarce think it moving . Silvery willows and poplars , fed by the waters , gave a natural shade to the sloping banks . Approaching I dipped my toes in , then as far as my knees , and not content with that I undressed , and draped my light clothes on a hanging willow , and plunged , naked , into the stream . While I gathered the water to me and splashed , gliding around in a thousand ways , and stretching out my arms to shake the water from them , I thought I heard a murmur under the surface , and , in fear , I leapt for the nearest bank of the flood . ‘
361	368	355	355	you	22	’ Alpheus called from the waves . ‘
374	596	371	371	you	22	’ He called again to me , in a strident voice . Just as I was , I fled , without my clothes ( I had left my clothes on the other bank ): so much the more fiercely he pursued and burned , and being naked , I seemed readier for him . So I ran , and so he wildly followed , as doves fly from a hawk on flickering wings , as a hawk is used to chasing frightened doves . Even beyond Orchemenus , I still ran , by Psophis , and Cyllene , and the ridges of Maenalus , by chill Erymanthus , Elis , he no quicker than I. But I could not stay the course , being unequal in strength : he was fitted for unremitting effort . Still , across the plains , over tree - covered mountains , through rocks and crags , and where there was no path , I ran . The sun was at my back . I saw a long shadow stretching before my feet , unless it was my fear that saw it , but certainly I feared the sound of feet , and the deep breaths from his mouth stirred the ribbons in my hair . Weary with the effort to escape him , I cried out ‘
634	690	691	691	Arethusa	8	’ The goddess was moved , and raising an impenetrable cloud , threw it over me . The river - god circled the concealing fog , and in ignorance searched about the hollow mist . Twice , without understanding , he rounded the place , where the goddess had concealed me , and twice called out ‘
696	925	694	694	Arethusa	8	’ What wretched feelings were mine , then ? Perhaps those the lamb has when it hears the wolves , howling round the high fold , or the hare , that , hidden in the briars , sees the dogs hostile muzzles , and does not dare to make a movement of its body ? He did not go far : he could see no signs of my tracks further on : he observed the cloud and the place . Cold sweat poured down my imprisoned limbs , and dark drops trickled from my whole body . Wherever I moved my foot , a pool gathered , and moisture dripped from my hair , and faster than I can now tell the tale I turned to liquid . And indeed the river - god saw his love in the water , and putting off the shape of a man he had assumed , he changed back to his own watery form , and mingled with mine . The Delian goddess split the earth , and plunging down into secret caverns , I was brought here to Ortygia , dear to me , because it has the same name as my goddess , the ancient name , for Delos , where she was born , and this was the first place to receive me , into the clear air . ’
