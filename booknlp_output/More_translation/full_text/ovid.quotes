1985	1991	2026	2026	he	1411	“ Palace of High Heaven . ”
2051	2154	2026	2026	he	1411	“ The time when serpent footed giants strove to fix their hundred arms on captive Heaven , not more than this event could cause alarm for my dominion of the universe . Although it was a savage enemy , yet warred we with a single source derived of one . Now must I utterly destroy this mortal race wherever Nereus roars around the world . Yea , by the Infernal Streams that glide through Stygian groves beneath the world , I swear it . Every method has been tried . The knife must cut immedicable wounds , lest maladies infect untainted parts . “
2228	2335	2340	2340	he	0	” Ardent in their wrath , the astonished Gods demand revenge overtake this miscreant ; he who dared commit such crimes . ' Twas even thus when raged that impious band to blot the Roman name in sacred blood of Caesar , sudden apprehensive fears of ruin absolute astonished man , and all the world convulsed . Nor is the love thy people bear to thee , Augustus , less than these displayed to Jupiter whose voice and gesture all the murmuring host restrained : and as indignant clamour ceased , suppressed by regnant majesty , Jove once again broke the deep silence with imperial words ; “
2414	2687	2694	2696	not one house	1426	“ I traversed Maenalus where fearful dens abound , over Lycaeus , wintry slopes of pine tree groves , across Cyllene steep ; and as the twilight warned of night 's approach , I stopped in that Arcadian tyrant 's realms and entered his inhospitable home : — and when I showed his people that a God had come , the lowly prayed and worshiped me , but this Lycaon mocked their pious vows and scoffing said ; ‘ A fair experiment will prove the truth if this be god or man . ’ and he prepared to slay me in the night , — to end my slumbers in the sleep of death . So made he merry with his impious proof ; but not content with this he cut the throat of a Molossian hostage sent to him , and partly softened his still quivering limbs in boiling water , partly roasted them on fires that burned beneath . And when this flesh was served to me on tables , I destroyed his dwelling and his worthless Household Gods , with thunder bolts avenging . Terror struck he took to flight , and on the silent plains is howling in his vain attempts to speak ; he raves and rages and his greedy jaws , desiring their accustomed slaughter , turn against the sheep — still eager for their blood . His vesture separates in shaggy hair , his arms are changed to legs ; and as a wolf he has the same grey locks , the same hard face , the same bright eyes , the same ferocious look . “
2738	3114	3904	3904	sister	1430	” with exclamations some approved the words of Jove and added fuel to his wrath , while others gave assent : but all deplored and questioned the estate of earth deprived of mortals . Who could offer frankincense upon the altars ? Would he suffer earth to be despoiled by hungry beasts of prey ? Such idle questions of the state of man the King of Gods forbade , but granted soon to people earth with race miraculous , unlike the first . And now his thunder bolts would Jove wide scatter , but he feared the flames , unnumbered , sacred ether might ignite and burn the axle of the universe : and he remembered in the scroll of fate , there is a time appointed when the sea and earth and Heavens shall melt , and fire destroy the universe of mighty labour wrought . Such weapons by the skill of Cyclops forged , for different punishment he laid aside — for straightway he preferred to overwhelm the mortal race beneath deep waves and storms from every raining sky . And instantly he shut the Northwind in Aeolian caves , and every other wind that might dispel the gathering clouds . He bade the Southwind blow : — the Southwind flies abroad with dripping wings , concealing in the gloom his awful face : the drenching rain descends from his wet beard and hoary locks ; dark clouds are on his brows and from his wings and garments drip the dews : his great hands press the overhanging clouds ; loudly the thunders roll ; the torrents pour ; Iris , the messenger of Juno , clad in many coloured raiment , upward draws the steaming moisture to renew the clouds . The standing grain is beaten to the ground , the rustic 's crops are scattered in the mire , and he bewails the long year 's fruitless toil . The wrath of Jove was not content with powers that emanate from Heaven ; he brought to aid his azure brother , lord of flowing waves , who called upon the Rivers and the Streams : and when they entered his impearled abode , Neptune , their ancient ruler , thus began ; “
3147	3902	3906	3906	wife	1431	” Thus he commands , and none dissenting all the River Gods return , and opening up their fountains roll tumultuous to the deep unfruitful sea . And Neptune with his trident smote the Earth , which trembling with unwonted throes heaved up the sources of her waters bare ; and through her open plains the rapid rivers rushed resistless , onward bearing the waving grain , the budding groves , the houses , sheep and men , — and holy temples , and their sacred urns . The mansions that remained , resisting vast and total ruin , deepening waves concealed and whelmed their tottering turrets in the flood and whirling gulf . And now one vast expanse , the land and sea were mingled in the waste of endless waves — a sea without a shore . One desperate man seized on the nearest hill ; another sitting in his curved boat , plied the long oar where he was wo nt to plow ; another sailed above his grain , above his hidden dwelling ; and another hooked a fish that sported in a leafy elm . Perchance an anchor dropped in verdant fields , or curving keels were pushed through tangled vines ; and where the gracile goat enjoyed the green , unsightly seals reposed . Beneath the waves were wondering Nereids , viewing cities , groves and houses . Dolphins darting mid the trees , meshed in the twisted branches , beat against the shaken oak trees . There the sheep , affrayed , swim with the frightened wolf , the surging waves float tigers and lions : availeth naught his lightning shock the wild boar , nor avails the stag 's fleet footed speed . The wandering bird , seeking umbrageous groves and hidden vales , with wearied pinion droops into the sea . The waves increasing surge above the hills , and rising waters dash on mountain tops . Myriads by the waves are swept away , and those the waters spare , for lack of food , starvation slowly overcomes at last . A fruitful land and fair but now submerged beneath a wilderness of rising waves , ' Twixt Oeta and Aonia , Phocis lies , where through the clouds Parnassus ' summits twain point upward to the stars , unmeasured height , save which the rolling billows covered all : there in a small and fragile boat , arrived , Deucalion and the consort of his couch , prepared to worship the Corycian Nymphs , the mountain deities , and Themis kind , who in that age revealed in oracles the voice of fate . As he no other lived so good and just , as she no other feared the Gods . When Jupiter beheld the globe in ruin covered , swept with wasting waves , and when he saw one man of myriads left , one helpless woman left of myriads lone , both innocent and worshiping the Gods , he scattered all the clouds ; he blew away the great storms by the cold northwind . Once more the earth appeared to heaven and the skies appeared to earth . The fury of the main abated , for the Ocean ruler laid his trident down and pacified the waves , and called on azure Triton . — Triton arose above the waving seas , his shoulders mailed in purple shells . — He bade the Triton blow , blow in his sounding shell , the wandering streams and rivers to recall with signal known : a hollow wreathed trumpet , tapering wide and slender stemmed , the Triton took amain and wound the pearly shell at midmost sea . Betwixt the rising and the setting suns the wildered notes resounded shore to shore , and as it touched his lips , wet with the brine beneath his dripping beard , sounded retreat : and all the waters of the land and sea obeyed . Their fountains heard and ceased to flow ; their waves subsided ; hidden hills uprose ; emerged the shores of ocean ; channels filled with flowing streams ; the soil appeared ; the land increased its surface as the waves decreased : and after length of days the trees put forth , with ooze on bending boughs , their naked tops . And all the wasted globe was now restored , but as he viewed the vast and silent world Deucalion wept and thus to Pyrrha spoke ; “
4057	4172	4048	4049	the Gods	1395	” , Thus Deucalion 's plaint to Pyrrha ; — and they wept . And after he had spoken , they resolved to ask the aid of sacred oracles , — and so they hastened to Cephissian waves which rolled a turbid flood in channels known . Thence when their robes and brows were sprinkled well , they turned their footsteps to the goddess ' fane : its gables were befouled with reeking moss and on its altars every fire was cold . But when the twain had reached the temple steps they fell upon the earth , inspired with awe , and kissed the cold stone with their trembling lips , and said ; “
4215	4224	4207	4209	O gentle goddess	1444	” Moved by their supplications , she replied ; “
4252	4319	4320	4320	Oracles	1448	” Long they stood in dumb amazement : Pyrrha , first of voice , refused the mandate and with trembling lips implored the goddess to forgive — she feared to violate her mother 's bones and vex her sacred spirit . Often pondered they the words involved in such obscurity , repeating oft : and thus Deucalion to Epimetheus ' daughter uttered speech of soothing import ; “
4363	4832	4320	4320	Oracles	1448	” And although Pyrrha by his words was moved she hesitated to comply ; and both amazed doubted the purpose of the oracle , but deemed no harm to come of trial . They , descending from the temple , veiled their heads and loosed their robes and threw some stones behind them . It is much beyond belief , were not receding ages witness , hard and rigid stones assumed a softer form , enlarging as their brittle nature changed to milder substance , — till the shape of man appeared , imperfect , faintly outlined first , as marble statue chiseled in the rough . The soft moist parts were changed to softer flesh , the hard and brittle substance into bones , the veins retained their ancient name . And now the Gods supreme ordained that every stone Deucalion threw should take the form of man , and those by Pyrrha cast should woman 's form assume : so are we hardy to endure and prove by toil and deeds from what we sprung . And after this the Earth spontaneous produced the world of animals , when all remaining moistures of the mirey fens fermented in the sun , and fruitful seeds in soils nutritious grew to shapes ordained . So when the seven streamed Nile from oozy fields returneth duly to her ancient bed , the sun 's ethereal rays impregn the slime , that haply as the peasants turn the soil they find strange animals unknown before : some in the moment of their birth , and some deprived of limbs , imperfect ; often part alive and part of slime inanimate are fashioned in one body . Heat combined with moisture so conceives and life results from these two things . For though the flames may be the foes of water , everything that lives begins in humid vapour , and it seems discordant concord is the means of life . When Earth , spread over with diluvian ooze , felt heat ethereal from the glowing sun , unnumbered species to the light she gave , and gave to being many an ancient form , or monster new created . Unwilling she created thus enormous Python . — Thou unheard of serpent spread so far athwart the side of a vast mountain , didst fill with fear the race of new created man . The God that bears the bow ( a weapon used till then only to hunt the deer and agile goat ) destroyed the monster with a myriad darts , and almost emptied all his quiver , till envenomed gore oozed forth from livid wounds . Lest in a dark oblivion time should hide the fame of this achievement , sacred sports he instituted , from the Python called “
4837	4976	4320	4320	Oracles	1448	” In these the happy youth who proved victorious in the chariot race , running and boxing , with an honoured crown of oak leaves was enwreathed . The laurel then was not created , wherefore Phoebus , bright and godlike , beauteous with his flowing hair , was wo nt to wreathe his brows with various leaves . Daphne , the daughter of a River God was first beloved by Phoebus , the great God of glorious light . ' Twas not a cause of chance but out of Cupid 's vengeful spite that she was fated to torment the lord of light . For Phoebus , proud of Python 's death , beheld that impish god of Love upon a time when he was bending his diminished bow , and voicing his contempt in anger said ; “
5084	5095	5097	5097	Phoebus	549	” to him , undaunted , Venus , son replied ; “
5148	5340	5142	5142	thy	1453	” No more he said , but with his wings expanded thence flew lightly to Parnassus , lofty peak . There , from his quiver he plucked arrows twain , most curiously wrought of different art ; one love exciting , one repelling love . The dart of love was glittering , gold and sharp , the other had a blunted tip of lead ; and with that dull lead dart he shot the Nymph , but with the keen point of the golden dart he pierced the bone and marrow of the God . Immediately the one with love was filled , the other , scouting at the thought of love , rejoiced in the deep shadow of the woods , and as the virgin Phoebe ( who denies the joys of love and loves the joys of chase ) a maiden 's fillet bound her flowing hair , — and her pure mind denied the love of man . Beloved and wooed she wandered silent paths , for never could her modesty endure the glance of man or listen to his love . Her grieving father spoke to her , “
5368	5404	5358	5359	a grandchild	1460	” But Daphne only hung her head to hide her shame . The nuptial torch seemed criminal to her . She even clung , caressing , with her arms around his neck , and pled , “
5427	5534	5417	5417	Jove	456	” But though her father promised her desire , her loveliness prevailed against their will ; for , Phoebus when he saw her waxed distraught , and filled with wonder his sick fancy raised delusive hopes , and his own oracles deceived him . — As the stubble in the field flares up , or as the stacked wheat is consumed by flames , enkindled from a spark or torch the chance pedestrian may neglect at dawn ; so was the bosom of the god consumed , and so desire flamed in his stricken heart . He saw her bright hair waving on her neck ; — “
5541	5605	5417	5417	Jove	456	” He saw her eyes like stars of sparkling fire , her lips for kissing sweetest , and her hands and fingers and her arms ; her shoulders white as ivory ; — and whatever was not seen more beautiful must be . Swift as the wind from his pursuing feet the virgin fled , and neither stopped nor heeded as he called ; “
5698	5776	5691	5691	I	0	“ The wilderness is rough and dangerous , and I beseech thee be more careful — I will follow slowly . — Ask of whom thou wilt , and thou shalt learn that I am not a churl — I am no mountain dweller of rude caves , nor clown compelled to watch the sheep and goats ; and neither canst thou know from whom thy feet fly fearful , or thou wouldst not leave me thus . “
5895	6118	6121	6122	my father	1438	” But even as he made his plaint , the Nymph with timid footsteps fled from his approach , and left him to his murmurs and his pain . Lovely the virgin seemed as the soft wind exposed her limbs , and as the zephyrs fond fluttered amid her garments , and the breeze fanned lightly in her flowing hair . She seemed most lovely to his fancy in her flight ; and mad with love he followed in her steps , and silent hastened his increasing speed . As when the greyhound sees the frightened hare flit over the plain : — With eager nose outstretched , impetuous , he rushes on his prey , and gains upon her till he treads her feet , and almost fastens in her side his fangs ; but she , whilst dreading that her end is near , is suddenly delivered from her fright ; so was it with the god and virgin : one with hope pursued , the other fled in fear ; and he who followed , borne on wings of love , permitted her no rest and gained on her , until his warm breath mingled in her hair . Her strength spent , pale and faint , with pleading eyes she gazed upon her father 's waves and prayed , “
6155	6287	6289	6289	thou	1473	” Before her prayer was ended , torpor seized on all her body , and a thin bark closed around her gentle bosom , and her hair became as moving leaves ; her arms were changed to waving branches , and her active feet as clinging roots were fastened to the ground — her face was hidden with encircling leaves . — Phoebus admired and loved the graceful tree , ( For still , though changed , her slender form remained ) and with his right hand lingering on the trunk he felt her bosom throbbing in the bark . He clung to trunk and branch as though to twine . His form with hers , and fondly kissed the wood that shrank from every kiss . And thus the God ; “
6398	6666	6387	6387	thou	1473	” Here the God , Phoebus Apollo , ended his lament , and unto him the Laurel bent her boughs , so lately fashioned ; and it seemed to him her graceful nod gave answer to his love . There is a grove in Thessaly , enclosed on every side with crags , precipitous , — on which a forest grows — and this is called the Vale of Tempe — through this valley flows the River Peneus , white with foaming waves , that issue from the foot of Pindus , whence with sudden fall up gather steamy clouds that sprinkle mist upon the circling trees , and far away with mighty roar resound . It is the abode , the solitary home , that mighty River loves , where deep in gloom of rocky cavern , he resides and rules the flowing waters and the water nymphs abiding there . All rivers of that land now hasten thither , doubtful to console or flatter Daphne 's parent : poplar crowned Sperchios , swift Enipeus and the wild Amphrysos , old Apidanus and Aeas , with all their kindred streams that wandering maze and wearied seek the ocean . Inachus alone is absent , hidden in his cave obscure , deepening his waters with his tears — most wretchedly bewailing , for he deems his daughter Io lost . If she may live or roam a spirit in the nether shades he dares not even guess but dreads for Jove not long before had seen her while returning from her father 's stream , and said ; “
6708	6719	6387	6387	thou	1473	” and as he spoke he pointed out the groves — “
6778	6917	6741	6742	a God	4898	” For while he spoke she fled , and swiftly left behind the pasture fields of Lerna , and Lyrcea 's arbours , where the trees are planted thickly . But the God called forth a heavy shadow which involved the wide extended earth , and stopped her flight and ravished in that cloud her chastity . Meanwhile , the goddess Juno gazing down on earth 's expanse , with wonder saw the clouds as dark as night enfold those middle fields while day was bright above . She was convinced the clouds were none composed of river mist nor raised from marshy fens . Suspicious now , from oft detected amours of her spouse , she glanced around to find her absent lord , and quite convinced that he was far from heaven , she thus exclaimed ; “
6930	6992	6925	6925	Jove	456	” From the dome of heaven she glided down and stood upon the earth , and bade the clouds recede . But Jove had known the coming of his queen . He had transformed the lovely Io , so that she appeared a milk white heifer — formed so beautiful and fair that envious Juno gazed on her . She queried : “
7002	7474	7475	7475	Ah	1484	” As if she guessed no knowledge of the truth . And Jupiter , false hearted , said the cow was earth begotten , for he feared his queen might make inquiry of the owner 's name . Juno implored the heifer as a gift . — what then was left the Father of the Gods ? ' Twould be a cruel thing to sacrifice his own beloved to a rival 's wrath . Although refusal must imply his guilt the shame and love of her almost prevailed ; but if a present of such little worth were now denied the sharer of his couch , the partner of his birth , ' twould prove indeed the earth born heifer other than she seemed — and so he gave his mistress up to her . Juno regardful of Jove 's cunning art , lest he might change her to her human form , gave the unhappy heifer to the charge of Argus , Aristorides , whose head was circled with a hundred glowing eyes ; of which but two did slumber in their turn whilst all the others kept on watch and guard . Whichever way he stood his gaze was fixed on Io — even if he turned away his watchful eyes on Io still remained . He let her feed by day ; but when the sun was under the deep world he shut her up , and tied a rope around her tender neck . She fed upon green leaves and bitter herbs and on the cold ground slept — too often bare , she could not rest upon a cushioned couch . She drank the troubled waters . Hoping aid she tried to stretch imploring arms to Argus , but all in vain for now no arms remained ; the sound of bellowing was all she heard , and she was frightened with her proper voice . Where former days she loved to roam and sport , she wandered by the banks of Inachus : there imaged in the stream she saw her horns and , startled , turned and fled . And Inachus and all her sister Naiads knew her not , although she followed them , they knew her not , although she suffered them to touch her sides and praise her . When the ancient Inachus gathered sweet herbs and offered them to her , she licked his hands , kissing her father 's palms , nor could she more restrain her falling tears . If only words as well as tears would flow , she might implore his aid and tell her name and all her sad misfortune ; but , instead , she traced in dust the letters of her name with cloven hoof ; and thus her sad estate was known . “
7479	7498	7475	7475	Ah	1484	” her father cried ; and as he clung around her horns and neck repeated while she groaned , “
7640	7821	7823	7823	thou	1491	” While thus he moaned came starry Argus there , and Io bore from her lamenting father . Thence he led his charge to other pastures ; and removed from her , upon a lofty mountain sat , whence he could always watch her , undisturbed . The sovereign god no longer could endure to witness Io 's woes . He called his son , whom Maia brightest of the Pleiades brought forth , and bade him slay the star eyed guard , argus . He seized his sleep compelling wand and fastened waving wings on his swift feet , and deftly fixed his brimmed hat on his head : — lo , Mercury , the favoured son of Jove , descending to the earth from heaven 's plains , put off his cap and wings , — though still retained his wand with which he drove through pathless wilds some stray she goats , and as a shepherd fared , piping on oaten reeds melodious tunes . Argus , delighted with the charming sound of this new art began ; “
7858	7932	7933	7933	I	0	” Wherefore , Mercury sat down beside the keeper and conversed of various things — passing the laggard hours . — then soothly piped he on the joined reeds to lull those ever watchful eyes asleep ; but Argus strove his languor to subdue , and though some drowsy eyes might slumber , still were some that vigil kept . Again he spoke , ( for the pipes were yet a recent art ) “
7942	7948	7949	7951	A famous Naiad	1493	” To him the God , “
8048	8077	8044	8044	she	1493	“ Now chanced it Pan . Whose head was girt with prickly pines , espied the Nymph returning from the Lycian Hill , and these words uttered he : ”
8198	8212	8194	8195	poor Pan	496	“ Forever this discovery shall remain a sweet communion binding thee to me . ”
8498	8502	8503	8503	he	498	“ Fear not , ”
8506	8515	8516	8516	He	498	“ For she shall trouble thee no more . ”
8764	8799	8757	8757	Io	489	“ Poor , demented fellow , what will you not credit if your mother speaks , you are so puffed up with the fond conceit of your imagined sire , the Lord of Day . ”
8822	8875	8807	8807	Phaethon	501	“ ' Twill grieve you , mother , I , the bold and free , was silent ; and it shames me to report this dark reproach remains unchallenged . Oh , if I am born of race divine , give proof of that illustrious descent and claim my right to Heaven . ”
8952	9079	8938	8938	her	1520	“ I swear to you by yonder orb , so radiant and bright , which both beholds and hears us while we speak , that you are his begotten son . — You are the child of that great light which sways the world : and if I have not spoken what is true , let not mine eyes behold his countenance , and let this fatal moment be the last that I shall look upon the light of day ! Nor will it weary you , my son , to reach your father 's dwelling ; for the very place where he appears at dawn is near our land . Go , if it please you , and the very truth learn from your father . ”
9504	9525	9501	9501	he	549	“ Declare the reason of thy journey . What wilt thou in this my palace , Phaethon my child beloved ? ”
9533	9592	9530	9531	the youth	1554	“ O universal light of all the world , my father Phoebus , if thy name be mine , if Clymene has not concealed her sin beneath some pretext , give to me , my sire , a token to declare thy fatherhood which may establish my assured descent , and leave no dark suspicions in our minds . ”
9621	9684	9613	9613	he	549	“ O child most worthy of thy sire , the truth was told thee by thy mother ; wherefore doubts to dissipate , consider thy desire , and ask of me that I may freely give : yea , let the Nether Lake , beyond our view , ( which is the oath of Gods inviolate ) be witness to my word . ”
9735	9890	9722	9722	he	549	“ Ah , would I might refuse my plighted word ; and oh , that it were lawful to deny the promised boon . — For I confess , O son , this only I should keep from thee — and yet ' Tis lawful to dissuade . It is unsafe to satisfy thy will . It is a great request , O Phaethon , which neither suits thy utmost strength nor tender years ; for thou art mortal , and thou hast aspired to things immortal . Ignorance has made thy thought transcend the province of the Gods . I vaunt no vain exploits ; but only I can stand securely on the flame - fraught axle - tree : even the Ruler of Olympian Gods , who hurls fierce lightnings with his great right hand , may never dare to drive this chariot , and what art thou to equal mighty Jove ? “
9996	10073	9963	9963	her	507	“ I struggle on . The force that overcomes the heavenly bodies overwhelms me not , and I am borne against that rapid globe . Suppose the chariot thine : what canst thou do ? Canst thou drive straight against the twisted pole and not be carried from the lofty path by the swift car ? Art thou deceived to think there may be groves and cities of the Gods , and costly temples wondrously endowed ? “
10142	10202	10135	10135	Cancer	510	“ It is no easy task for thee to rule the mettled four - foot steeds , enflamed in fires that kindle in their breasts , forth issuing in breathings from their mouths and nostrils hot ; — I scarce restrain them , as their struggling necks pull on the harness , when their heated fires are thus aroused . “
10297	10408	10412	10412	his	0	“ Look round thee on the treasured world 's delights and ask the greatest blessing of the sky , or sea or land , and thou shalt suffer no repulse : but only this I must deplore , which rightly named would be a penalty and not an honour . — Thou hast made request of punishment and not a gift indeed . O witless boy ! why dost thou hold my neck with thy caressing arms ? For , doubt it not , as I have sworn it by the Stygian Waves , whatever thou shalt wish , it shall be given — but thou shouldst wish more wisely . ”
10678	10783	10665	10665	he	1574	“ If thou canst only heed thy father 's voice — be sparing of the whip and use with nerve the reins ; for of their own accord the steeds will hasten . Difficult are they to check in full career . Thou must not drive the car directly through five circles , for the track takes a wide curve , obliquely , and is bound by the extreme edge of three zones . — It avoids the Southern Pole , and it avoids the Bear that roams around the north . The way is plain ; the traces of the Wheel are manifest . “
10841	10912	10914	10914	I	0	“ Take thou the middle plane , where all is safe ; nor let the Wheel turn over to the right and bear thee to the twisted Snake ! nor let it take thee to the Altar on the left — so close to earth — but steer the middle course . — to Fortune I commit thy fate , whose care for thee so reckless of thyself I pray . “
11013	12457	12461	12461	thy	1586	” But Phaethon with youthful vigor leaped , and in the light - made chariot lightly stood : and he rejoiced , and with the reins in hand thanked his reluctant parent . Instantly Eous , Aethon , Pyrois and Phlegon , the winged horses of the Sun , gave vent to flame - like neighs that filled the shaking air ; they pawed the barriers with their shining hoofs . Then Tethys , witless of her grandson 's fate let back the barriers , — and the universe was theirs to traverse . Taking the well - known road , and moving through the air with winged feet , they pierced resisting clouds , and spreading wide their pinions soared upon the eastern wind , far - wafted from that realm . But Phaethon , so easy of their yoke , lost all control , and the great car was tossed , — as tapered ships when lightened of their ballast toss and heave unsteady in the surging seas : the car leaped lightly in the air , and in the heights was tossed unsteady as an empty shell . Soon as the steeds perceived it , with a rush impetuous , they left the beaten track ; regardless of all order and control ; and Phaethon filled with fear , knew not to guide with trusted reins , nor where the way might be — nor , if he knew , could he control their flight . Warmed in the sunshine , never felt before , the gelid Triones attempted vain to bathe in seas forbid : the Serpent cold and torpid by the frozen Pole , too cold for contest , warmed , and rage assumed from heat bootes , troubled by the heat , took flight , impeded by his wain . And as from skies of utmost height unhappy Phaethon beheld the earth receding from his view , a pallor spread his cheeks with sudden fear ; his knees began to quake ; and through the flare of vast effulgence darkness closed his eyes . Now vainy he regrets he ever touched his father 's steeds , and he is stunned with grief that so entreating he prevailed to know his true descent . He rather would be called the son of Merops . As a ship is tossed by raging Boreas , when the conquered helm has been abandoned , and the pilot leaves the vessel to his vows and to the Gods ; so , helpless , he is borne along the sky . What can he ? Much of heaven remains behind ; a longer distance is in front of him — each way is measured in his anxious mind . — at first his gaze is fixed upon the west , which fate has destined he shall never reach , and then his eyes turn backward to the east . — so , stupefied and dazed he neither dares to loose the bits , nor tighten on the reins , and he is ignorant of the horses ' names . He sees horrific wonders scattered round , and images of hideous animals . — and there 's a spot where Scorpion bends his claws in double circles , and with tail and arms on either side , stretches his limbs throughout the space of two Celestial Signs ; and when the lad beheld him , steeped in oozing slime of venom , swart , and threatening to strike grim wounds with jagged spear - points , he was lost ; and , fixed in chills of horror , dropped the reins . When these they felt upon their rising backs , the startled steeds sprang forthwith ; and , unchecked , through atmospheres of regions unexplored , thence goaded by their unchecked violence , broke through the lawful bounds , and rushed upon the high fixed stars . They dragged the chariot through devious ways , and soared amid the heights ; dashed down deep pathways , far , precipitous , and gained a level near the scorching earth . Phoebe is wondering that her brother 's steeds run lower than her own , and sees the smoke of scorching clouds . The highest altitudes are caught in flames , and as their moistures dry they crack in chasms . The grass is blighted ; trees are burnt up with their leaves ; the ripe brown crops give fuel for self destruction — Oh what small complaints ! Great cities perish with their walls , and peopled nations are consumed to dust — the forests and the mountains are destroyed . Cilician Taurus , Athos and Tmolus , and Oeta are burning ; and the far - famed Ida and all her cooling rills are dry and burning , and virgin Helicon , and Hoemos — later Oeagrius called — and Aetna with tremendous , redoubled flames , and double - peaked Parnassus , Sicilian Eryx , Cynthus — Othrys , pine - clad , and Rhodope , deprived his snowy mantle , and Dindyma and Mycale and Mimas , and Mount Cithaeron , famed for sacred rites : and Scythia , though a land of frost , is burning , and Caucasus , — and Ossa burns with Pindus , — and greater than those two Olympus burns — the lofty Alps , the cloud - topped Apennines . And Phaethon , as he inhaled the air , burning and scorching as a furnace blast , and saw destruction on the flaming world , and his great chariot wreathed in quenchless fires , was suddenly unable to endure the heat , the smoke and cinders , and he swooned away . — if he had known the way , those winged steeds would rush as wild unguided . — then the skin of Ethiopians took a swarthy hue , the hot blood tingling to the surface : then the heat dried up the land of Libya ; dishevelled , the lorn Nymphs , lamenting , sought for all their emptied springs and lakes in vain ; Boeotia wailed for Dirce 's cooling wave , and Argos wailed for Amymone 's stream — and even Corinth for the clear Pyrene . Not safer from the flames were distant streams ; — the Tanais in middle stream was steaming and old Peneus and Teuthrantian Caicus , Ismenus , rapid and Arcadian Erymanthus ; and even Xanthus destined for a second burning , and tawny - waved Lycormas , and Meander , turning and twisting , and Thracian Melas burns , and the Laconian Eurotas burns , the mighty Babylonian Euphrates , Orontes and the Ganges , swift Thermodon , Ister and Phasis and Alpheus boil . The banks of Spercheus burn , the gold of Tagus is melting in the flames . The swans whose songs enhanced the beauties of Maeonian banks are scalded in the Cayster 's middle wave . The Nile affrighted fled to parts remote , and hid his head forever from the world : now empty are his seven mouths , and dry without or wave or stream ; and also dry Ismenian Hebrus , Strymon and the streams of Hesper - Land , the rivers Rhine and Rhone , and Po , and Tiber , ruler of the world . And even as the ground asunder burst , the light amazed in gloomy Tartarus the King Infernal and his Spouse . The sea contracted and his level waste became a sandy desert . The huge mountain tops , once covered by the ocean 's waves , reared up , by which the scattered Cyclades increased . Even the fishes sought for deeper pools ; — the crooked dolphins dared not skip the waves ; the lifeless sea - calves floated on the top ; and it is even famed that Nereus hid with Doris and her daughters , deep below in seething caverns . With a dauntless mien thrice Neptune tried to thrust his arms above the waters ; — thrice the heated air overcame his courage . Then the genial Earth , although surrounded by the waters of the sea , was parched and dry ; for all her streams had hid deep in the darkness of her winding caves . — she lifted her productive countenance , up to her rounded neck , and held her palms on her sad brows ; and as the mountains huge trembled and tottered , beneath her wonted plane declined she for a space — and thus began , with parched voice ; “
12518	12605	12609	12609	my	0	“ How difficult to open my parched mouth , and speak these words ! ( the vapours choking her ) , behold my scorching hair , and see the clouds of ashes falling on my blinded eyes , and on my features ! What a recompense for my fertility ! How often I have suffered from the wounds of crooked plows and rending harrows — tortured year by year ! For this I give to cattle juicy leaves and fruits to man and frankincense to thee ! “
12734	13039	13480	13480	mother	5115	” So made the tortured Earth an end of speech ; and she was fain to hide her countenance in caves that border on the nether night . But now the Almighty Father , having called to witness all the Gods of Heaven , and him who gave the car , that , else his power be shown , must perish all in dire confusion , high he mounted to the altitude from which he spreads the mantling clouds , and fulminates his dreadful thunders and swift lightning - bolts terrific . — Clouds were none to find on the earth , and the surrounding skies were void of rain . — Jove , having reached that summit , stood and poised in his almighty hand a flashing dart , and , hurling it , deprived of life and seat the youthful charioteer , and struck with fire the raging flames — and by the same great force those flames enveloping the earth were quenched , and he who caused their fury lost his life . Frantic in their affright the horses sprang across the bounded way and cast their yokes , and through the tangled harness lightly leaped . And here the scattered harness lay , and there the shattered axle , wrenched from off the pole , and various portions of the broken car ; spokes of the broken Wheel were scattered round . And far fell Phaethon with flaming hair ; as haply from the summer sky appears a falling star , although it never drops to startled earth . — Far distant from his home the deep Eridanus received the lad and bathed his foaming face . His body charred by triple flames Hesperian Naiads bore , still smoking , to a tomb , and this engraved upon the stone ; “
13064	13228	13058	13058	he	501	” Filled with consuming woe , his father hid his countenance which grief had overcast . And now , surpassing our belief , they say a day passed over with no glowing sun ; — but light - affording flames appeared to change disaster to the cause of good . Amazed , the woeful Clymene , when she had moaned in grief , amid her lamentations tore her bosom , as across the world she roamed , at first to seek his lifeless corpse , and then his bones . She wandered to that distant land and found at last his bones ensepulchred . There , clinging to the grave she fell and bathed with many tears his name on marble carved , and with her bosom warmed the freezing stone . And all the daughters of the Sun went there giving their tears , alas a useless gift ; — they wept and beat their breasts , and day and night called , “
13231	13475	13058	13058	he	501	” who heard not any sound of their complaint : — and there they lay foredone , all scattered round the tomb . The silent moon had four times joined her horns and filled her disk , while they , according to an ancient rite , made lamentation . Prone upon the ground , the eldest , Phaethusa , would arise from there , but found her feet were growing stiff ; and uttered moan . Lampetia wished to aid her sister but was hindered by new roots ; a third when she would tear her hair , plucked forth but leaves : another wailed to find her legs were fastened in a tree ; another moaned to find her arms to branches had been changed . And while they wondered , bark enclosed their thighs , and covered their smooth bellies , and their breasts , and shoulders and their hands , but left untouched their lips that called upon their mother 's name . What can she do for them ? Hither she runs and thither runs , wherever frenzy leads . She kisses them , alas , while yet she may ! But not content with this , she tried to hale their bodies from the trees ; and she would tear the tender branches with her hands , but lo ! The blood oozed out as from a bleeding wound ; and as she wounded them they shrieked aloud , “
13498	13772	13773	13773	My	0	” And as they spoke the bark enclosed their lips . Their tears flow forth , and from the new - formed boughs amber distils and slowly hardens in the sun ; and far from there upon the waves is borne to deck the Latin women . Cycnus , son of Sthenelus , by his maternal house akin to Phaethon , and thrice by love allied , beheld this wonderful event . — he left his kingdom of Liguria , and all its peopled cities , to lament where the sad sisters had increased the woods , beside the green banks of Eridanus . There , as he made complaint , his manly voice began to pipe a treble , shrill ; and long gray plumes concealed his hair . A slender neck extended from his breast , and reddening toes were joined together by a membrane . Wings grew from his sides , and from his mouth was made a blunted beak . Now Cycnus is a swan , and yet he fears to trust the skies and Jove , for he remembers fires , unjustly sent , and therefore shuns the heat that he abhors , and haunts the spacious lakes and pools and streams that quench the fires . In squalid garb , meanwhile , and destitute of all his rays , the sire of Phaethon , as dark as when eclipse bedims his Wheel , abhors himself and hates the light , shuns the bright day , gives up his mind to grief , adds passion to his woe , denies the earth his countenance , and thus laments ; “
13886	14277	14301	14301	I	0	” But all the Deities encircle Phoebus as he makes complaint , and with their supplications they entreat him not to plunge the world in darkness . Jove would find excuses for the lightning - bolt , hurled from his hand , and adds imperious threats to his entreaties . Phoebus calls his steeds , frenzied with their maddening fires , and breaks their fury , as he vents with stinging lash his rage upon them , and in passion lays on them the death of Phaethon his son . Now after Phaethon had suffered death for the vast ruin wrought by scorching flames , all the great walls of Heaven 's circumference , unmeasured , views the Father of the Gods , with searching care , that none impaired by heat may fall in ruins . Well assured they stand in self - sustaining strength , his view , at last , on all the mundane works of man is turned ; — his loving gaze long resting on his own Arcadia . And he starts the streams and springs that long have feared to flow ; paints the wide earth with verdant fields ; covers the trees with leaves , and clothes the injured forests in their green . While wandering in the world , he stopped amazed , when he beheld the lovely Nymph , Calisto , and fires of love were kindled in his breast . Calisto was not clothed in sumptuous robes , nor did she deck her hair in artful coils ; but with a buckle she would gird her robe , and bind her long hair with a fillet white . She bore a slender javelin in her hand , or held the curving bow ; and thus in arms as chaste Diana , none of Maenalus was loved by that fair goddess more than she . But everything must change . When bright the sun rolled down the sky , beyond his middle course , she pierced a secret thicket , known to her , and having slipped the quiver from her arm , she loosed the bended bow , and softly down upon the velvet turf reclining , pressed her white neck on the quiver while she slept . When Jupiter beheld her , negligent and beautiful , he argued thus , “
14312	14343	14309	14309	her	1603	” This said , the god transformed himself and took Diana 's form — assumed Diana 's dress and imitating her awoke the maid , and spoke in gentle tones , “
14359	14371	14348	14352	O virgin of my train	1605	” Which , having heard , Calisto , rose and said , “
14391	14717	14381	14381	I	0	” Jove heard and smiled , well pleased to be preferred above himself , and kissed her many times , and strained her in his arms , while she began to tell the varied fortunes of her hunt . — but when his ardent love was known to her , she struggled to escape from his embrace : ah , how could she , a tender maid , resist almighty Jove ? — Be sure , Saturnia if thou hadst only witnessed her thy heart had shown more pity ! — Jupiter on wings , transcendent , sought his glorious heights ; but she , in haste departing from that grove , almost forgot her quiver and her bow . Behold , Diana , with her virgin train , when hunting on the slopes of Maenalus , amidst the pleasures of exciting sport , espied the Nymph and called her , who , afraid that Jove apparelled in disguise deceived , drew backward for a moment , till appeared to her the lovely Nymphs that followed : thus , assured deceit was none , she ventured near . Alas , how difficult to hide disgrace ! She could not raise her vision from the ground , nor as the leader of the hunting Nymphs , as was her wo nt , walk by the goddess ' side . Her silence and her blushes were the signs of injured honour . Ah Diana , thou , if thou wert not a virgin , wouldst perceive and pity her unfortunate distress . The Moon 's bent horns were rising from their ninth sojourn , when , fainting from Apollo 's flames , the goddess of the Chase observed a cool umbrageous grove , from which a murmuring stream ran babbling gently over golden sands . When she approved the spot , lightly she struck her foot against the ripples of the stream , and praising it began ; “
14739	14767	14770	14770	Thou	1609	” Quickly they undid their garments , — but Calisto hid behind the others , till they knew her state . — Diana in a rage exclaimed , “
14778	14845	14770	14770	Thou	1609	” And she was driven thence . Ere this transpired , observed the consort of the Thunder - God her altered mien ; but she for ripening time withheld severe resentment . Now delay was needless for distracted Juno heard Calisto of the god of Heaven had borne a boy called Arcas . Full of jealous rage , her eyes and thoughts enkindled as she cried ; “
14894	15365	14877	14877	I	0	” So saying , by her forehead 's tresses seized the goddess on her rival ; and she dragged her roughly to the ground . Pleading she raised her suppliant arms and begged for mercy . — While she pled , black hair spread over her white limbs ; her hands were lengthened into feet , and claws long - curving tipped them ; snarling jaws deformed the mouth that Jove had kissed . And lest her prayers and piteous words might move some listening God , and give remembrance , speech was so denied , that only from her throat came angry growls , now uttered hoarse and threatening . Still remains her understanding , though her body , thus transformed , makes her appear a savage bear . — her sorrows are expressed in many a groan , repeated as she lifts her hands — if we may call them so — repeated as she lifts them towards the stars and skies , ungrateful Jove regarding ; but her voice accuses not . Afraid to rest in unfrequented woods , she wandered in the fields that once were hers , around her well - known dwelling . Over crags , in terror , she was driven by the cries of hounds ; and many a time she fled in fear , a huntress from the hunters , or she hid from savage animals ; forgetting her transformed condition . Changed into a bear , she fled affrighted from the bears that haunt the rugged mountains ; and she feared and fled the wolves , — although her father was a wolf . When thrice five birthdays rounded out the youth of Arcas , offspring of Lycaon 's child , he hunted in the forest of his choice ; where , hanging with his platted nets the trees of Erymanthian forest , he espied his transformed mother , — but he knew her not ; no one had told him of his parentage . Knowing her child , she stood with levelled gaze , amazed and mute as he began approach ; but Arcas , frightened at the sight drew back to pierce his mother 's breast with wounding spear . — but not permitting it the god of Heaven averted , and removed them from that crime . He , in a mighty wind — through vacant space , upbore them to the dome of starry heaven , and fixed them , Constellations , bright amid the starry host . Juno on high beheld Calisto crowned with glory — great with rage her bosom heaved . She flew across the sea , to hoary Tethys and to old Oceanus , whom all the Gods revere , and thus to them in answer to their words she made address ; “
15447	15506	15522	15522	he	1620	“ Who , then , should hesitate to put affront on Juno ? matchless goddess ! each offense redounds in benefit ! Who dreads her rage ? Oh boundless powers ! Oh unimagined deeds ! My enemy assumes a goddess ' form when my decree deprives her human shape ; — and thus the guilty rue their chastisement ! “
15564	15619	15621	15624	the Gods of Ocean	1624	“ Oh , if an injury to me , your child , may move your pity ! drive the Seven Stars from waters crystalline and azure - tint , and your domain debar from those that shine in Heaven , rewarded for Jove 's wickedness . — bathe not a concubine in waters pure . ”
15873	15975	15868	15870	the prattling Crow	1635	“ A fruitless errand has befooled thy wits ! Take timely warning of my fateful cries : consider what I was and what I am : was justice done ? ' Twas my fidelity that caused my downfall . For , it came to pass , within a basket , fashioned of small twigs , Minerva had enclosed that spawn ; begot without a mother , Ericthonius ; which to the wardship of three virgins , born of double - natured Cecrops , she consigned with this injunction , ‘ Look ye not therein , nor learn the secret . ’ — “
16072	16121	16057	16057	My	0	“ Not my desire impelled me to report to her , nor did I crave protection ; which , if thou wilt ask Minerva , though enraged she must confirm . And when is told to thee what lately fame established , thou wilt not despise the Crow . “
16226	16341	16218	16218	he	1647	“ I fled from that sea - shore , to fields of shifting sands that all my steps delayed : and in despair upon the Gods and all mankind I called for aid , but I was quite alone and helpless . Presently the chaste Minerva , me , a virgin , heard and me assistance gave : for as my arms implored the Heavens , downy feathers grew from out the flesh ; and as I tried to cast my mantle from my shoulders , wings appeared upon my tender sides ; and as I strove to beat my naked bosom with my hands , nor hands remained nor naked breast to beat . “
16501	16516	16531	16531	Your	1648	” But now replied the Raven to the Crow , that talked so much , “
16538	16674	16531	16531	Your	1648	” With which retort he winged upon his journey , swiftly thence in haste , despite the warning to inform his patron , Phoebus , how he saw the fair Coronis with a lad of Thessaly . And when Apollo , Phoebus , heard the tale the busy Raven made such haste to tell , he dropped his plectrum and his laurel wreath , and his bright countenance went white with rage . He seized his trusted arms , and having bent his certain bow , pierced with a deadly shaft that bosom which so often he had pressed against his own . Coronis moaned in pain , — and as she drew the keen shaft from the wound , her snow - white limbs were bathed in purple blood : and thus she wailed , “
16704	17146	17148	17148	thou	1652	” This said , her soul expired with her life - blood , and death congealed her drooping form . Sadly the love - lore God repents his jealous deed ; regrets too late his ready credence to the Raven 's tale . Mourning his thoughtless deed , blaming himself , he vents his rage upon the talking bird ; he hates his bow , the string , his own right hand , the fateful arrow . As a last resource , and thus to overcome her destiny , he strove to cherish her beloved form ; for vain were all his medicinal arts . But when he saw upraised the funeral pyre , where wreathed in flames her body should be burnt , the sorrow of his heart welled forth in sighs ; but tearless orbed , for no celestial face may tide of woe bedew . So grieves the poor dam , when , swinging from his right the flashing ax , the butcher with a sounding blow divides the hollow temples of her sucking calf . Yet , after Phoebus poured the fragrant myrrh , sweet perfumes on her breast , that now once more against his own he pressed , and after all the prematurely hastened rites were done , he would not suffer the offspring of his loins to mingle with her ashes , but he plucked from out the flames , forth from the mother 's thighs his child , unborn , and carried to the cave of double - natured Chiron . Then to him he called the silly raven , high in hopes of large requital due for all his words ; but , angry with his meddling ways , the God turned the white feathers of that bird to black and then forbade forever more to perch among the favoured birds whose plumes are white . Chiron , the Centaur , taught his pupil ; proud that he was honoured by that God - like charge . Behold , his lovely daughter , who was born beside the margin of a rapid stream , came forward , with her yellow hair as gold adown her shoulders . — She was known by name Ocyroe . The hidden things that Fate conceals , she had the power to tell ; for not content was she to learn her father 's arts , but rather pondered on mysterious things . So , when the god of Frenzy warmed her breast , gazing on Aesculapius , — the child of Phoebus and Coronis , while her soul was gifted , with prophetic voice she said ; “
17251	17324	17325	17325	She	1652	“ And thou , dear father Chiron , brought to birth with pledge of an immortal life , informed with ever - during strength , when biting flames of torment from the baneful serpent 's blood are coursing in thy veins , thou shalt implore a welcome death ; and thy immortal life the Gods shall suffer to the power of death . — and the three Destinies shall cut thy thread . ”
17355	17396	17351	17351	she	1652	“ The Fates constrain my speech and I can say no more ; my power has gone . Alas , my art , although of little force and doubtful worth , has brought upon my head the wrath of Heaven . “
17467	17797	17457	17458	My father	1438	” And as she wailed the words became confused and scarcely understood ; and soon her speech was only as the whinny of a mare . Down to the meadow 's green her arms were stretched ; her fingers joined together , and smooth hoofs made of five nails a single piece of horn . Her face and neck were lengthened , and her hair swept downward as a tail ; the scattered locks that clung around her neck were made a mane , tossed over to the right . Her voice and shape were altogether changed , and since that day the change has given her a different name . In vain her hero father , Chiron , prayed the glorious God , Apollo , her to aid . He could not thwart the will of mighty Jove ; and if the power were his , far from the spot , from thence afar his footsteps trod the fields of Elis and Messenia , far from thence . Now while Apollo wandered on those plains , — his shoulders covered with a shepherd 's skin , his left hand holding his long shepherd 's staff , his right hand busied with the seven reeds of seven sizes , brooding over the death of Hymenaeus , lost from his delight ; while mournful ditties on the reeds were tuned , — his kine , forgotten , strayed away to graze over the plains of Pylos . Mercury observed them , unattended , and from thence drove them away and hid them in the forest . So deftly did he steal them , no one knew or noticed save an ancient forester , well known to all the neighbor - folk , by them called Battus . He was keeper of that wood , and that green pasture where the blooded mares of rich Neleus grazed . As Mercury distrusted him , he led him to one side and said ; “
17845	17857	17836	17836	I	0	” Now when the gift was his , old Battus said , “
17885	17926	17866	17866	thy	1662	” And as he spoke , he pointed to a stone . The son of Jove pretended to depart , but quickly changed his voice and features , and retraced his steps , and thus again addressed that ancient man ; “
17966	17980	17954	17954	thee	1662	” So the reward was doubled ; and the old man answered him , “
17987	18005	17954	17954	thee	1662	” and so they were ‘ Beyond those hills . ’ And , laughing , Mercury said , “
18023	18039	18017	18017	thou	1662	” The god indignant turned his perjured breast into a stone which even now is called “
18045	18541	18017	18017	thou	1662	” a disgraceful name , derived from days of old , but undeserved . High in the dome of Heaven , behold the bright Caduceus - Bearer soared on balanced wings ; and far below him through a fruitful grove , devoted to Minerva 's hallowed reign , some virgins bearing on their lovely heads , in wicker baskets wreathed and decked with flowers , their sacred offerings to the citadel of that chaste goddess . And the winged God , while circling in the clear unbounded skies , beheld that train of virgins , beautiful , as they were thence returning on their way . Not forward on a level line he flew , but wheeled in circles round . Lo , the swift kite swoops round the smoking entrails , while the priests enclose in guarded ranks their sacrifice : wary with fear , that swiftest of all birds , dares not to venture from his vantage height , but greedily hovers on his waving wings around his keen desire . So , the bright God circled those towers , Actaean , round and round , in mazey circles , greedy as the bird . As much as Lucifer outshines the stars that emulate the glory of his rays , as greatly as bright Phoebe pales thy light , O lustrous Lucifer ! so far surpassed in beauty the fair maiden Herse , all those lovely virgins of that sacred train , departing joyous from Minerva 's grove . The Son of Jove , astonished , while he wheeled on balanced pinions through the yielding air , burned hot ; as oft from Balearic sling the leaden missile , hurled with sudden force , burns in a glowing heat beneath the clouds . Then sloped the god his course from airy height , and turned a different way ; another way he went without disguise , in confidence of his celestial grace . But though he knew his face was beautiful , he combed his hair , and fixed his flowing raiment , that the fringe of radiant gold appeared . And in his hand he waved his long smooth wand , with which he gives the wakeful sleep or waketh ridded eyes . He proudly glanced upon his twinkling feet that sparkled with their scintillating wings . In a secluded part of that great fane , devoted to Minerva 's hallowed rites , three chambers were adorned with tortoise shell and ivory and precious woods inlaid ; and there , devoted to Minerva 's praise , three well known sisters dwelt . Upon the right dwelt Pandrosos and over on the left Aglauros dwelt , and Herse occupied the room between those two . When Mercury drew near to them , Aglauros first espied the God , and ventured to enquire his name , and wherefore he was come . Then gracious spoke to her in answer the bright son of Jove ; “
18591	19068	19070	19070	thy	1668	” Aglauros , on the son of Jupiter , gazed with those eyes that only lately viewed the guarded secret of the yellow - haired Minerva , and demanded as her price gold of great weight ; before he paid denied admittance of the house . Minerva turned , with orbs of stern displeasure , towards the maid Aglauros ; and her bosom heaved with sighs so deeply laboured that her Aegis - shield was shaken on her valiant breast . For she remembered when Aglauros gave to view her charge , with impious hand , that monster form without a mother , maugre Nature 's law , what time the god who dwells on Lemnos loved . — now to requite the god and sister ; her to punish whose demand of gold was great ; Minerva to the Cave of Envy sped . Dark , hideous with black gore , her dread abode is hidden in the deepest hollowed cave , in utmost limits where the genial sun may never shine , and where the breathing winds may never venture ; dismal , bitter cold , untempered by the warmth of welcome fires , involved forever in abounding gloom . When the fair champion came to this abode she stood before its entrance , for she deemed it not a lawful thing to enter there : and she whose arm is mortal to her foes , struck the black door - posts with her pointed spear , and shook them to the center . Straight the doors flew open , and , behold , within was Envy ravening the flesh of vipers , self - begot , the nutriment of her depraved desires . — when the great goddess met her evil gaze she turned her eyes away . But Envy slow , in sluggish languor from the ground uprose , and left the scattered serpents half - devoured ; then moving with a sullen pace approached . — and when she saw the gracious goddess , girt with beauty and resplendent in her arms , she groaned aloud and fetched up heavy sighs . Her face is pale , her body long and lean , her shifting eyes glance to the left and right , her snaggle teeth are covered with black rust , her hanging paps overflow with bitter gall , her slavered tongue drips venom to the ground ; busy in schemes and watchful in dark snares sweet sleep is banished from her blood - shot eyes ; her smiles are only seen when others weep ; with sorrow she observes the fortunate , and pines away as she beholds their joy ; her own existence is her punishment , and while tormenting she torments herself . Although Minerva held her in deep scorn she thus commanded her with winged words ; “
19087	19498	19084	19084	my	0	” She spake ; and spurning with her spear the ground departed ; and the sad and furtive - eyed envy observed her in her glorious flight : she murmured at the goddess , great in arms : but waiting not she took in hand her staff , which bands of thorns encircled as a wreath , and veiled in midnight clouds departed thence . She blasted on her way the ripening fields ; scorched the green meadows , starred with flowers , and breathed a pestilence throughout the land and the great cities . When her eyes beheld the glorious citadel of Athens , great in art and wealth , abode of joyful peace , she hardly could refrain from shedding tears , that nothing might be witnessed worthy tears . She sought the chamber where Aglauros slept , and hastened to obey the God 's behest . She touched the maiden 's bosom with her hands , foul with corrupting stains , and pierced her heart with jagged thorns , and breathed upon her face a noxious venom ; and distilled through all the marrow of her bones , and in her lungs , a poison blacker than the ooze of pitch . And lest the canker of her poisoned soul might spread unchecked throughout increasing space , she caused a vision of her sister 's form to rise before her , happy with the God who shone in his celestial beauty . All appeared more beautiful than real life . — when the most wretched daughter of Cecrops had seen the vision secret torment seized on all her vitals ; and she groaned aloud , tormented by her frenzy day and night . A slow consumption wasted her away , as ice is melted by the slant sunbeam , when the cool clouds are flitting in the sky . If she but thought of Herse 's happiness she burned , as thorny bushes are consumed with smoldering embers under steaming stems . She could not bear to see her sister 's joy , and longed for death , an end of misery ; or schemed to end the torture of her mind by telling all she knew in shameful words , whispered to her austere and upright sire . But after many agonizing hours , she sat before the threshold of their home to intercept the God , who as he neared spoke softly in smooth blandishment . “

19531	20374	19523	19523	us	1671	” Rejoined the graceful - formed Cyllenian God , who as he spoke thrust open with a touch of his compelling wand the carved door . But when she made an effort to arise , her thighs felt heavy , rigid and benumbed ; and as she struggled to arise her knees were stiffened ? and her nails turned pale and cold ; her veins grew pallid as the blood congealed . And even as the dreaded cancer spreads through all the body , adding to its taint the flesh uninjured ; so , a deadly chill entered by slow degrees her breast , and stopped her breathing , and the passages of life . She did not try to speak , but had she made an effort to complain there was not left a passage for her voice . Her neck was changed to rigid stone , her countenance felt hard ; she sat a bloodless statue , but of stone not marble - white — her mind had stained it black . So from the land of Pallas went the God , his great revenge accomplished on the head of impious Aglauros ; and he soared on waving wings into the opened skies : and there his father called him to his side , and said , — with words to hide his passion ; — Son , — thou faithful minister of my commands . — let naught delay thee — swiftly take the way , accustomed , to the land of Sidon ( which adores thy mother 's star upon the left ) when there , drive over to the sounding shore that royal herd , which far away is fed on mountain grass . — he spoke , and instantly the herd was driven from the mountain side ; then headed for the shore , as Jove desired , — to where the great king 's daughter often went in play , attended by the maids of Tyre . — can love abide the majesty of kings ? Love can not always dwell upon a throne . — Jove laid aside his glorious dignity , for he assumed the semblance of a bull and mingled with the bullocks in the groves , his colour white as virgin snow , untrod , unmelted by the watery Southern Wind . His neck was thick with muscles , dewlaps hung between his shoulders ; and his polished horns , so small and beautifully set , appeared the artifice of man ; fashioned as fair and more transparent than a lucent gem . His forehead was not lowered for attack , nor was there fury in his open eyes ; the love of peace was in his countenance . When she beheld his beauty and mild eyes , the daughter of Agenor was amazed ; but , daring not to touch him , stood apart until her virgin fears were quieted ; then , near him , fragrant flowers in her hand she offered , — tempting , to his gentle mouth : and then the loving god in his great joy kissed her sweet hands , and could not wait her will . Jove then began to frisk upon the grass , or laid his snow - white side on the smooth sand , yellow and golden . As her courage grew he gave his breast one moment for caress , or bent his head for garlands newly made , wreathed for his polished horns . The royal maid , unwitting what she did , at length sat down upon the bull 's broad back . Then by degrees the god moved from the land and from the shore , and placed his feet , that seemed but shining hoofs , in shallow water by the sandy merge ; and not a moment resting bore her thence , across the surface of the Middle Sea , while she affrighted gazed upon the shore — so fast receding . And she held his horn with her right hand , and , steadied by the left , held on his ample back — and in the breeze her waving garments fluttered as they went . Now Jupiter had not revealed himself , nor laid aside the semblance of a bull , until they stood upon the plains of Crete . But not aware of this , her father bade her brother Cadmus search through all the world , until he found his sister , and proclaimed him doomed to exile if he found her not ; — thus was he good and wicked in one deed . When he had vainly wandered over the earth ( for who can fathom the deceits of Jove ? ) Cadmus , the son of King Agenor , shunned his country and his father 's mighty wrath . But he consulted the famed oracles of Phoebus , and enquired of them what land might offer him a refuge and a home . And Phoebus answered him ; “
20454	21066	21073	21073	I	0	” Cadmus turned ; but hardly had descended from the cave , Castalian , ere he saw a heifer go unguarded , gentle - paced , without the scars of labour on her neck . He followed close upon her steps ( and silently adored celestial Phoebus , author of his way ) till over the channel that Cephissus wears he forded to the fields of Panope and even over to Boeotia . — there stood the slow - paced heifer , and she raised her forehead , broad with shapely horns , towards Heaven ; and as she filled the air with lowing , stretched her side upon the tender grass , and turned her gaze on him who followed in her path . Cadmus gave thanks and kissed the foreign soil , and offered salutation to the fields and unexplored hills . Then he prepared to make large sacrifice to Jupiter , and ordered slaves to seek the living springs whose waters in libation might be poured . There was an ancient grove , whose branching trees had never known the desecrating ax , where hidden in the undergrowth a cave , with oziers bending round its low - formed arch , was hollowed in the jutting rocks — deep - found in the dark center of that hallowed grove — beneath its arched roof a beauteous stream of water welled serene . Its gloom concealed a dragon , sacred to the war - like Mars ; crested and gorgeous with radescent scales , and eyes that sparkled as the glow of coals . A deadly venom had puffed up his bulk , and from his jaws he darted forth three tongues , and in a triple row his sharp teeth stood . Now those who ventured of the Tyrian race , misfortuned followers of Cadmus , took the path that led them to this grove ; and when they cast down - splashing in the springs an urn , the hidden dragon stretched his azure head out from the cavern 's gloom , and vented forth terrific hissings . Horrified they dropped their urns . A sudden trembling shook their knees ; and their life - blood was ice within their veins . The dragon wreathed his scales in rolling knots , and with a spring , entwisted in great folds , reared up his bulk beyond the middle rings , high in the air from whence was given his gaze the extreme confines of the grove below . A size prodigious , his enormous bulk , if seen extended where was naught to hide , would rival in its length the Serpent 's folds , involved betwixt the planes of the Twin Bears . The terrified Phoenicians , whether armed for conflict , or in flight precipitate , or whether held incapable from fear , he seized with sudden rage ; stung them to death , or crushed them in the grasp of crushing folds , or blasted with the poison of his breath . High in the Heavens the sun small shadow made when Cadmus , wondering what detained his men , prepared to follow them . Clothed in a skin torn from a lion , he was armed , complete , with lance of glittering steel ; and with a dart : but passing these he had a dauntless soul . When he explored the grove and there beheld the lifeless bodies , and above them stretched the vast victorious dragon licking up the blood that issued from their ghastly wounds ; his red tongues dripping gore ; then Cadmus filled with rage and grief ; “
21084	21519	21520	21522	Son of Agenor	567	” He spoke ; and lifted up a mill - stone huge , in his right hand , and having poised it , hurled with a tremendous effort dealing such a blow would crush the strongest builded walls ; yet neither did the dragon flinch the shock nor was he wounded , for his armour - scales , fixed in his hard and swarthy hide , repelled the dreadful impact . Not the javelin thus , so surely by his armoured skin was foiled , for through the middle segment of his spine the steel point pierced , and sank beneath the flesh , deep in his entrails . Writhing in great pain he turned his head upon his bleeding back , twisting the shaft , with force prodigious shook it back and forth , and wrenched it from the wound ; with difficulty wrenched it . But the steel remained securely fastened in his bones . Such agony but made increase of rage : his throat was swollen with great knotted veins ; a white froth gathered on his poisonous jaws ; the earth resounded with his rasping scales ; he breathed upon the grass a pestilence , steaming mephitic from his Stygian mouth . His body writhes up in tremendous gyres ; his folds , now straighter than a beam , untwist ; he rushes forward on his vengeful foe , his great breast crushing the deep - rooted trees . Small space gave Cadmus to the dragon 's rage , for by the lion 's spoil he stood the shock , and thrusting in his adversary 's jaws the trusted lance gave check his mad career . Wild in his rage the dragon bit the steel and fixed his teeth on the keen - biting point : out from his poisoned palate streams of gore spouted and stained the green with sanguine spray . Yet slight the wound for he recoiled in time , and drew his wounded body from the spear ; by shrinking from the sharp steel saved his throat a mortal wound . But Cadmus as he pressed the spear - point deeper in the serpent 's throat , pursued him till an oak - tree barred the way ; to this he fixed the dragon through the neck : the stout trunk bending with the monster 's weight , groaned at the lashing of his serpent tail . While the brave victor gazed upon the bulk enormous of his vanquished foe , a voice was heard — from whence was difficult to know , but surely heard — “
21546	21788	21520	21522	Son of Agenor	567	” Terrified , amazed , he lost his colour and his self - control ; his hair stood upright from the dreadful fright . But lo , the hero 's watchful Deity , Minerva , from the upper realms of air appeared before him . She commanded him to sow the dragon 's teeth in mellowed soil , from which might spring another race of men . And he obeyed : and as he plowed the land , took care to scatter in the furrowed soil the dragon 's teeth ; a seed to raise up man . ' Tis marvelous but true , when this was done the clods began to move . A spear - point first appeared above the furrows , followed next by helmet - covered heads , nodding their cones ; their shoulders , breasts and arms weighted with spears ; and largely grew the shielded crop of men . — so is it in the joyful theaters when the gay curtains , rolling from the floor , are upward drawn until the scene is shown , — it seems as if the figures rise to view : first we behold their faces , then we see their bodies , and their forms by slow degrees appear before us on the painted cloth . Cadmus , affrighted by this host , prepared to arm for his defence ; but one of those from earth created cried ; “
21797	22032	22033	22033	He	1678	” And with his trenchant sword he smote an earth - born brother , hand to hand ; even as the vanquished so the victor fell , pierced by a dart some distant brother hurled ; and likewise he who cast that dart was slain : both breathing forth their lives upon the air so briefly theirs , expired together . All as if demented leaped in sudden rage , each on the other , dealing mutual wounds . So , having lived the space allotted them , the youthful warriors perished as they smote the earth ( their blood - stained mother ) with their breasts : and only five of all the troop remained ; of whom Echion , by Minerva warned , called on his brothers to give up the fight , and cast his arms away in pledge of faith . — when Cadmus , exiled from Sidonia 's gates , builded the city by Apollo named , these five were trusted comrades in his toil . Now Thebes is founded , who can deem thy days unhappy in shine exile , Cadmus ? Thou , the son - in - law of Mars and Venus ; thou , whose glorious wife has borne to shine embrace daughters and sons ? And thy grandchildren join around thee , almost grown to man 's estate . — nor should we say , “
22039	22185	22033	22033	He	1678	” Till after death the funeral rites are paid . Thy grandson , Cadmus , was the first to cast thy dear felicity in sorrow 's gloom . Oh , it was pitiful to witness him , his horns outbranching from his forehead , chased by dogs that panted for their master 's blood ! If thou shouldst well inquire it will be shown his sorrow was the crime of Fortune — not his guilt — for who maintains mistakes are crimes ? Upon a mountain stained with slaughtered game , the young Hyantian stood . Already day , increasing to meridian , made decrease the flitting shadows , and the hot sun shone betwixt extremes in equal distance . Such the hour , when speaking to his fellow friends , the while they wandered by those lonely haunts , actaeon of Hyantis kindly thus ; “
22253	22713	22719	22719	your	1682	” — all did as he commanded ; and they sought their needed rest . There is a valley called Gargaphia ; sacred to Diana , dense with pine trees and the pointed cypress , where , deep in the woods that fringed the valley 's edge , was hollowed in frail sandstone and the soft white pumice of the hills an arch , so true it seemed the art of man ; for Nature 's touch ingenious had so fairly wrought the stone , making the entrance of a grotto cool . Upon the right a limpid fountain ran , and babbled , as its lucid channel spread into a clear pool edged with tender grass . Here , when a - wearied with exciting sport , the Sylvan goddess loved to come and bathe her virgin beauty in the crystal pool . After Diana entered with her nymphs , she gave her javelin , quiver and her bow to one accustomed to the care of arms ; she gave her mantle to another nymph who stood near by her as she took it off ; two others loosed the sandals from her feet ; but Crocale , the daughter of Ismenus , more skillful than her sisters , gathered up the goddess ' scattered tresses in a knot ; — her own were loosely wantoned on the breeze . Then in their ample urns dipt up the wave and poured it forth , the cloud - nymph Nephele , the nymph of crystal pools called Hyale , the rain - drop Rhanis , Psecas of the dews , and Phyale the guardian of their urns . And while they bathed Diana in their streams , Actaeon , wandering through the unknown woods , entered the precincts of that sacred grove ; with steps uncertain wandered he as fate directed , for his sport must wait till morn . — soon as he entered where the clear springs welled or trickled from the grotto 's walls , the nymphs , now ready for the bath , beheld the man , smote on their breasts , and made the woods resound , suddenly shrieking . Quickly gathered they to shield Diana with their naked forms , but she stood head and shoulders taller than her guards . — as clouds bright - tinted by the slanting sun , or purple - dyed Aurora , so appeared Diana 's countenance when she was seen . Oh , how she wished her arrows were at hand ! But only having water , this she took and dashed it on his manly countenance , and sprinkled with the avenging stream his hair , and said these words , presage of future woe ; “
22737	22832	22726	22726	your	1682	” No more she threatened , but she fixed the horns of a great stag firm on his sprinkled brows ; she lengthened out his neck ; she made his ears sharp at the top ; she changed his hands and feet ; made long legs of his arms , and covered him with dappled hair — his courage turned to fear . The brave son of Autonoe took to flight , and marveled that he sped so swiftly on . — he saw his horns reflected in a stream and would have said , “
22838	23172	22726	22726	your	1682	” but now he had no voice , and he could only groan : large tears ran trickling down his face , transformed in every feature . — Yet , as clear remained his understanding , and he wondered what he should attempt to do : should he return to his ancestral palace , or plunge deep in vast vacuities of forest wilds ? Fear made him hesitate to trust the woods , and shame deterred him from his homeward way . While doubting thus his dogs espied him there : first Blackfoot and the sharp nosed Tracer raised the signal : Tracer of the Gnossian breed , and Blackfoot of the Spartan : swift as wind the others followed . Glutton , Quicksight , Surefoot , three dogs of Arcady ; then valiant Killbuck , Tempest , fierce Hunter , and the rapid Wingfoot ; sharp - scented Chaser , and Woodranger wounded so lately by a wild boar ; savage Wildwood , the wolf - begot with Shepherdess the cow - dog ; and ravenous Harpy followed by her twin whelps ; and thin - girt Ladon chosen from Sicyonia ; racer and Barker , brindled Spot and Tiger ; sturdy old Stout and white haired Blanche and black Smut lusty big Lacon , trusty Storm and Quickfoot ; active young Wolfet and her Cyprian brother black headed Snap , blazed with a patch of white hair from forehead to his muzzle ; swarthy Blackcoat and shaggy Bristle , Towser and Wildtooth , his sire of Dicte and his dam of Lacon ; and yelping Babbler : these and others , more than patience leads us to recount or name . All eager for their prey the pack surmount rocks , cliffs and crags , precipitous — where paths are steep , where roads are none . He flies by routes so oft pursued but now , alas , his flight is from his own ! — He would have cried , “
23184	23347	23348	23348	Actaeon	574	” Words refused his will . The yelping pack pressed on . First Blackmane seized and tore his master 's back , Savage the next , then Rover 's teeth were clinched deep in his shoulder . — These , though tardy out , cut through a by - path and arriving first clung to their master till the pack came up . The whole pack fastened on their master 's flesh till place was none for others . Groaning he made frightful sounds that not the human voice could utter nor the stag ; and filled the hills with dismal moans ; and as a suppliant fell down to the ground upon his trembling knees ; and turned his stricken eyes on his own dogs , entreating them to spare him from their fangs . But his companions , witless of his plight , urged on the swift pack with their hunting cries . They sought Actaeon and they vainly called , “
23354	23576	23352	23352	Actaeon	574	” just as though he was away from them . Each time they called he turned his head . And when they chided him , whose indolence denied the joys of sport , how much he wished an indolent desire had haply held him from his ravenous pack . Oh , how much;better ' tis to see the hunt , and the fierce dogs , than feel their savage deeds ! They gathered round him , and they fixed their snouts deep in his flesh : tore him to pieces , he whose features only as a stag appeared . — ' Tis said Diana 's fury raged with none abatement till the torn flesh ceased to live . Hapless Actaeon 's end in various ways was now regarded ; some deplored his doom , but others praised Diana 's chastity ; and all gave many reasons . But the spouse of Jove , alone remaining silent , gave nor praise nor blame . Whenever calamity befell the race of Cadmus she rejoiced , in secret , for she visited her rage on all Europa 's kindred . Now a fresh occasion has been added to her grief , and wild with jealousy of Semele , her tongue as ever ready to her rage , lets loose a torrent of abuse ; “
23697	23815	23821	23821	his	456	” She rose up quickly from her shining throne , and hidden in a cloud of fiery hue descended to the home of Semele ; and while encompassed by the cloud , transformed her whole appearance as to counterfeit old Beroe , an Epidaurian nurse , who tended Semele . Her tresses changed to grey , her smooth skin wrinkled and her step grown feeble as she moved with trembling limbs ; — her voice was quavering as an ancient dame 's , as Juno , thus disguised , began to talk to Semele . When presently the name of Jove was mentioned — artful Juno thus ; ( doubtful that Jupiter could be her love ) — “
23859	23902	23851	23851	him	456	” With artful words as these the goddess worked upon the trusting mind of Semele , daughter of Cadmus , till she begged of Jove a boon , that only hastened her sad death ; for Jove not knowing her design replied , “
23943	23978	23940	23941	the Gods	456	” All overjoyed at her misfortune , proud that she prevailed , and pleased that she secured of him a promise , that could only cause her own disaster , Semele addressed almighty Jove ; “
24003	24265	23996	23996	Juno	488	” Fain would he stifle her disastrous tongue ; before he knew her quest the words were said ; and , knowing that his greatest oath was pledged , he sadly mounted to the lofty skies , and by his potent nod assembled there the deep clouds : and the rain began to pour , and thunder - bolts resounded . But he strove to mitigate his power , and armed him not with flames overwhelming as had put to flight his hundred - handed foe Typhoeus — flames too dreadful . Other thunder - bolts he took , forged by the Cyclops of a milder heat , with which insignia of his majesty , sad and reluctant , he appeared to her . — her mortal form could not endure the shock and she was burned to ashes in his sight . An unformed babe was rescued from her side , and , nurtured in the thigh of Jupiter , completed Nature 's time until his birth . Ino , his aunt , in secret nursed the boy and cradled him . And him Nyseian nymphs concealed in caves and fed with needful milk . While these events according to the laws of destiny occurred , and while the child , the twice - born Bacchus , in his cradle lay , ' Tis told that Jupiter , a careless hour , indulged too freely in the nectar cup ; and having laid aside all weighty cares , jested with Juno as she idled by . Freely the god began ; “
24289	24386	24286	24287	a male	1699	” Juno denied it ; wherefore ' twas agreed to ask Tiresias to declare the truth , than whom none knew both male and female joys : for wandering in a green wood he had seen two serpents coupling ; and he took his staff and sharply struck them , till they broke and fled . ' Tis marvelous , that instant he became a woman from a man , and so remained while seven autumns passed . When eight were told , again he saw them in their former plight , and thus he spoke ; “
24409	24637	24406	24406	I	0	” And even as he struck the same two snakes , his former sex returned ; his manhood was restored . — as both agreed to choose him umpire of the sportive strife , he gave decision in support of Jove ; from this the disappointment Juno felt surpassed all reason , and enraged , decreed eternal night should seal Tiresias ' eyes . — immortal Deities may never turn decrees and deeds of other Gods to naught , but Jove , to recompense his loss of sight , endowed him with the gift of prophecy . Tiresias ' fame of prophecy was spread through all the cities of Aonia , for his unerring answers unto all who listened to his words . And first of those that harkened to his fateful prophecies , a lovely Nymph , named Liriope , came with her dear son , who then fifteen , might seem a man or boy — he who was born to her upon the green merge of Cephissus ' stream — that mighty River - God whom she declared the father of her boy . — she questioned him . Imploring him to tell her if her son , unequalled for his beauty , whom she called Narcissus , might attain a ripe old age . To which the blind seer answered in these words , “
24657	24893	24894	24894	Your	1701	” — so , frivolous the prophet 's words appeared ; and yet the event , the manner of his death , the strange delusion of his frenzied love , confirmed it . Three times five years so were passed . Another five - years , and the lad might seem a young man or a boy . And many a youth , and many a damsel sought to gain his love ; but such his mood and spirit and his pride , none gained his favour . Once a noisy Nymph , ( who never held her tongue when others spoke , who never spoke till others had begun ) mocking Echo , spied him as he drove , in his delusive nets , some timid stags . — for Echo was a Nymph , in olden time , — and , more than vapid sound , — possessed a form : and she was then deprived the use of speech , except to babble and repeat the words , once spoken , over and over . Juno confused her silly tongue , because she often held that glorious goddess with her endless tales , till many a hapless Nymph , from Jove 's embrace , had made escape adown a mountain . But for this , the goddess might have caught them . Thus the glorious Juno , when she knew her guile ; “
24920	25081	24910	24910	your	1701	” At once the Nymph was stricken as the goddess had decreed ; — and , ever since , she only mocks the sounds of others ' voices , or , perchance , returns their final words . One day , when she observed Narcissus wandering in the pathless woods , she loved him and she followed him , with soft and stealthy tread . — The more she followed him the hotter did she burn , as when the flame flares upward from the sulphur on the torch . Oh , how she longed to make her passion known ! To plead in soft entreaty ! to implore his love ! But now , till others have begun , a mute of Nature she must be . She can not choose but wait the moment when his voice may give to her an answer . Presently the youth , by chance divided from his trusted friends , cries loudly , “
25086	25090	24910	24910	your	1701	” and Echo , “
25093	25110	24910	24910	your	1701	” Replies . Amazed , he casts his eyes around , and calls with louder voice , “
25114	25115	24910	24910	your	1701	” “
25119	25141	24910	24910	your	1701	” She calls the youth who calls . — He turns to see who calls him and , beholding naught exclaims , “
25146	25147	24910	24910	your	1701	” “
25152	25173	24910	24910	your	1701	” returns . He tries again , again , and is deceived by this alternate voice , and calls aloud ; “
25180	25184	24910	24910	your	1701	” Echo cries , “
25191	25233	24910	24910	your	1701	” Never sound seemed sweeter to the Nymph , and from the woods she hastens in accordance with her words , and strives to wind her arms around his neck . He flies from her and as he leaves her says , “
25259	25265	25251	25253	such a one	1703	” Naught she answers save , “
25269	25457	25267	25267	me	0	” Thus rejected she lies hid in the deep woods , hiding her blushing face with the green leaves ; and ever after lives concealed in lonely caverns in the hills . But her great love increases with neglect ; her miserable body wastes away , wakeful with sorrows ; leanness shrivels up her skin , and all her lovely features melt , as if dissolved upon the wafting winds — nothing remains except her bones and voice — her voice continues , in the wilderness ; her bones have turned to stone . She lies concealed in the wild woods , nor is she ever seen on lonely mountain range ; for , though we hear her calling in the hills , ' tis but a voice , a voice that lives , that lives among the hills . Thus he deceived the Nymph and many more , sprung from the mountains or the sparkling waves ; and thus he slighted many an amorous youth . — and therefore , some one whom he once despised , lifting his hands to Heaven , implored the Gods , “
25468	25970	25267	25267	me	0	” and as the prayer was uttered it was heard by Nemesis , who granted her assent . There was a fountain silver - clear and bright , which neither shepherds nor the wild she - goats , that range the hills , nor any cattle 's mouth had touched — its waters were unsullied — birds disturbed it not ; nor animals , nor boughs that fall so often from the trees . Around sweet grasses nourished by the stream grew ; trees that shaded from the sun let balmy airs temper its waters . Here Narcissus , tired of hunting and the heated noon , lay down , attracted by the peaceful solitudes and by the glassy spring . There as he stooped to quench his thirst another thirst increased . While he is drinking he beholds himself reflected in the mirrored pool — and loves ; loves an imagined body which contains no substance , for he deems the mirrored shade a thing of life to love . He can not move , for so he marvels at himself , and lies with countenance unchanged , as if indeed a statue carved of Parian marble . Long , supine upon the bank , his gaze is fixed on his own eyes , twin stars ; his fingers shaped as Bacchus might desire , his flowing hair as glorious as Apollo 's , and his cheeks youthful and smooth ; his ivory neck , his mouth dreaming in sweetness , his complexion fair and blushing as the rose in snow - drift white . All that is lovely in himself he loves , and in his witless way he wants himself : — he who approves is equally approved ; he seeks , is sought , he burns and he is burnt . And how he kisses the deceitful fount ; and how he thrusts his arms to catch the neck that 's pictured in the middle of the stream ! Yet never may he wreathe his arms around that image of himself . He knows not what he there beholds , but what he sees inflames his longing , and the error that deceives allures his eyes . But why , O foolish boy , so vainly catching at this flitting form ? The cheat that you are seeking has no place . Avert your gaze and you will lose your love , for this that holds your eyes is nothing save the image of yourself reflected back to you . It comes and waits with you ; it has no life ; it will depart if you will only go . Nor food nor rest can draw him thence — outstretched upon the overshadowed green , his eyes fixed on the mirrored image never may know their longings satisfied , and by their sight he is himself undone . Raising himself a moment , he extends his arms around , and , beckoning to the murmuring forest ; “
26171	26289	26303	26303	thee	1711	“ Whoever thou art , Come up ! Deceive me not ! Oh , whither when I fain pursue art thou ? Ah , surely I am young and fair , the Nymphs have loved me ; and when I behold thy smiles I can not tell thee what sweet hopes arise . When I extend my loving arms to thee thine also are extended me — thy smiles return my own . When I was weeping , I have seen thy tears , and every sign I make thou cost return ; and often thy sweet lips have seemed to move , that , peradventure words , which I have never heard , thou hast returned . “
26454	26510	26519	26519	I	0	” He spoke ; and crazed with love , returned to view the same face in the pool ; and as he grieved his tears disturbed the stream , and ripples on the surface , glassy clear , defaced his mirrored form . And thus the youth , when he beheld that lovely shadow go ; “
26566	26762	26555	26555	I	0	” And while he spoke he rent his garment from the upper edge , and beating on his naked breast , all white as marble , every stroke produced a tint as lovely as the apple streaked with red , or as the glowing grape when purple bloom touches the ripening clusters . When as glass again the rippling waters smoothed , and when such beauty in the stream the youth observed , no more could he endure . As in the flame the yellow wax , or as the hoar - frost melts in early morning ' neath the genial sun ; so did he pine away , by love consumed , and slowly wasted by a hidden flame . No vermeil bloom now mingled in the white of his complexion fair ; no strength has he , no vigor , nor the comeliness that wrought for love so long : alas , that handsome form by Echo fondly loved may please no more . But when she saw him in his hapless plight , though angry at his scorn , she only grieved . As often as the love - lore boy complained , “
26765	26766	26555	26555	I	0	” “
26769	26806	26555	26555	I	0	” her echoing voice returned ; and as he struck his hands against his arms , she ever answered with her echoing sounds . And as he gazed upon the mirrored pool he said at last , “

26822	26835	26555	26555	I	0	” the spot returned his words ; and when he breathed a sad “
26838	26839	26555	26555	I	0	” “
26842	27075	26555	26555	I	0	” sighed Echo too . He laid his wearied head , and rested on the verdant grass ; and those bright eyes , which had so loved to gaze , entranced , on their own master 's beauty , sad Night closed . And now although among the nether shades his sad sprite roams , he ever loves to gaze on his reflection in the Stygian wave . His Naiad sisters mourned , and having clipped their shining tresses laid them on his corpse : and all the Dryads mourned : and Echo made lament anew . And these would have upraised his funeral pyre , and waved the flaming torch , and made his bier ; but as they turned their eyes where he had been , alas he was not there ! And in his body 's place a sweet flower grew , golden and white , the white around the gold . Narcissus ' fate , when known throughout the land and cities of Achaia , added fame deserved , to blind Tiresias , — mighty seer . Yet Pentheus , bold despiser of the Gods , son of Echion , scoffed at all his praise , and , sole of man deriding the great seer , upbraided him his hapless loss of sight . And shaking his white temples , hoar with age . Tiresias of Pentheus prophesied , “
27221	27308	27213	27214	blind Tiresias	598	” And as he spoke , lo , Pentheus drove the seer : but all his words , prophetic , were fulfilled , and confirmation followed in his steps . — Bacchus at once appears , and all the fields resound with shouts of everybody there . — men , brides and matrons , and a howling rout — nobles and commons and the most refined — a motley multitude — resistless borne to join those rites of Bacchus , there begun . Then Pentheus cries ; “
27377	27516	27517	27517	He	1732	“ How shall I wonder at these ancient men , who , crossing boundless seas from distant Tyre , hither transferred their exiled Household Gods , and founded a new Tyre ; but now are shorn , and even as captives would be led away without appeal to Mars ? And , O young men , of active prime whose vigor equals mine ! Cast down your ivy scepters ; take up arms ; put on your helmets ; strip your brows of leaves ; be mindful of the mighty stock you are , and let your souls be animated with the spirit of that dauntless dragon , which , unaided , slew so many , and at last died to defend his fountain and his lake . — so ye may conquer in the hope of fame . “
27603	27666	27696	27696	Pentheus	598	“ But now an unarmed boy will conquer Thebes : a lad whom neither weapons , wars nor steeds delight ; whose ringlets reek with myrrh ; adorned with chaplets , purple and embroidered robes of interwoven gold . Make way for me ! And I will soon compel him to confess his father is assumed and all his rites are frauds . “
27728	27834	27837	27837	ye	1742	” Him to restrain his grandsire , Cadmus , strove ; and Athamas , and many of his trusted friends united in vain efforts to rebuke his reckless rage ; but greater violence was gained from every admonition . — his rage increased the more it was restrained , and injury resulted from his friends . So have I seen a stream in open course , run gently on its way with pleasant noise , but whensoever logs and rocks detained , it foamed , with violence increased , against obstruction . Presently returning came his servants stained with blood , to whom he said , “
27842	27850	27837	27837	ye	1742	” And to him they made reply ; “
27873	27919	27865	27871	the chosen servant of his sacred rites	1745	” And they delivered to the noble king , a youth whose hands were lashed behind his back . Then Pentheus , terrible in anger , turned his awful gaze upon the lad , and though he scarce deferred his doom , addressed him thus ; “
27964	27970	27956	27956	thou	1747	” But fearless he replied ; “
28105	28175	28181	28181	I	0	“ And , afterwhile , that I might not be bound forever to my father 's rocky shores , I learned to steer the keel with dextrous hand ; and marked with watchful gaze the guiding stars ; the watery Constellation of the Goat , Olenian , and the Bear , the Hyades , the Pleiades , the houses of the winds , and every harbour suitable for ships . “
28217	28332	28197	28197	I	0	“ Now when the night was past and lovely dawn appeared , I , rose from slumber , and I bade my men to fetch fresh water , and I showed the pathway to the stream . Then did I climb a promontory 's height , to learn from there the promise of the winds ; which having done , I called the men and sought once more my ship . Opheltes , first of my companions , cried , ‘ Behold we come ! ’ And , thinking he had caught a worthy prize in that unfruitful land , he led a boy , of virgin - beauty formed , across the shore . “
28428	28575	28399	28400	a god	4898	“ At this , the one of all my mariners who was the quickest hand , who ever was the nimblest on the yards , and first to slip the ropes , Dictys exclaimed ; ‘ Pray not for us ! ’ and all approved his words . The golden haired , the guardian of the prow , Melanthus , Libys and Alcimedon approved it ; and Epopeus who should urge the flagging spirits , and with rhythmic chants give time and measure to the beating oars , and all the others praised their leader 's words , — so blind is greed of gain . — Then I rejoined , ‘ Mine is the greatest share in this good ship , which I will not permit to be destroyed , nor injured by this sacred freight : ’ and I opposed them as they came . “
28656	28801	28648	28651	all that wicked crew	1769	“ Then Bacchus ( be assured it was the God ) as though the noise disturbed his lethargy from wine , and reason had regained its power , at last bespake the men , ‘ What deeds are these ? What noise assails my ears ? What means decoyed my wandering footsteps ? Whither do ye lead ? ’ ‘ Fear not , ’ the steersman said , ‘ but tell us fair the haven of your hope , and you shall land whereso your heart desires . ’ ‘ To Naxos steer , ’ Quoth Bacchus , ‘ for it is indeed my home , and there the mariner finds welcome cheer . ’ Him to deceive , they pledged themselves , and swore by Gods of seas and skies to do his will : and they commanded me to steer that way . “
28871	28946	28857	28857	they	1771	“ I was amazed and answered , ‘ Take the helm . ’ And I refused to execute their will , atrocious , and at once resigned command . Then all began to murmur , and the crew reviled me . Up Aethalion jumped and said , ‘ As if our only safety is in you ! ’ With this he swaggered up and took command ; and leaving Naxos steered for other shores . “
29053	29120	29043	29043	I	0	“ The impious gang made merry at our tears , and lashed the billows with their quickening oars . By Bacchus do I swear to you ( and naught celestial is more potent ) all the things I tell you are as true as they surpass the limit of belief . The ship stood still as if a dry dock held it in the sea . — “
29208	29362	29369	29369	they	1784	“ Then the mariners leaped out , possessed by fear or madness . Medon first began to turn a swarthy hue , and fins grew outward from his flattened trunk , and with a curving spine his body bent . — then Lycabas to him , ‘ What prodigy is this that I behold ? ’ Even as he spoke , his jaws were broadened and his nose was bent ; his hardened skin was covered with bright scales . And Libys , as he tried to pull the oars , could see his own hands shrivel into fins ; another of the crew began to grasp the twisted ropes , but even as he strove to lift his arms they fastened to his sides ; — with bending body and a crooked back he plunged into the waves , and as he swam displayed a tail , as crescent as the moon . “
29480	29486	29472	29472	I	0	” But Pentheus answered him : “
29529	29745	29771	29771	me	0	” Quickly they seized and dragged Acoetes forth , and cast him in a dungeon triple - strong . And while they fixed the instruments of death , kindled the fires , and wrought the cruel irons , the legend says , though no one aided him , the chains were loosened and slipped off his arms ; the doors flew open of their own accord . But Pentheus , long - persisting in his rage , not caring to command his men to go , himself went forth to Mount Cithaeron , where resound with singing and with shrilly note the votaries of Bacchus at their rites . As when with sounding brass the trumpeter alarms of war , the mettled charger neighs and scents the battle ; so the clamored skies resounding with the dreadful outcries fret the wrath of Pentheus and his rage enflame . About the middle of the mount ( with groves around its margin ) was a treeless plain , where nothing might conceal . Here as he stood to view the sacred rites with impious eyes , his mother saw him first . She was so wrought with frenzy that she failed to know her son , and cast her thyrsus that it wounded him ; and shouted , “
29777	29827	29771	29771	me	0	” As he fled from them in fright the raging multitude rushed after him ; and , as they gathered round ; in cowardice he cried for mercy and condemned himself , confessing he had sinned against a God . And as they wounded him he called his aunt ; “
29843	29901	29905	29905	mother	5115	” No pity moved her when she heard that name ; in a wild frenzy she forgot her son . While Pentheus was imploring her , she tore his right arm out ; her sister Ino wrenched the other from his trunk . He could not stretch his arms out to his mother , but he cried , “
29907	29967	29905	29905	mother	5115	” When Agave saw , his bleeding limbs , torn , scattered on the ground , she howled , and tossed her head , and shook her hair that streamed upon the breeze ; and when his head was wrenched out from his mangled corpse , she clutched it with her blood - smeared fingers , while she shouted , “
29979	30188	29977	29977	ours	1799	” So when the wind strips from a lofty tree its leaves , which touched by autumn 's cold are loosely held , they fall not quicker than the wretch 's bleeding limbs were torn asunder by their cursed hands . Now , frightened by this terrible event , the women of Ismenus celebrate the new Bacchantian rites ; and they revere the sacred altars , heaped with frankincense . Alcithoe , daughter of King Minyas , consents not to the orgies of the God ; denies that Bacchus is the son of Jove , and her two sisters join her in that crime . ' Twas festal - day when matrons and their maids , keeping it sacred , had forbade all toil . — And having draped their bosoms with wild skins , they loosed their long hair for the sacred wreaths , and took the leafy thyrsus in their hands ; — for so the priest commanded them . Austere the wrath of Bacchus if his power be scorned . Mothers and youthful brides obeyed the priest ; and putting by their wickers and their webs , dropt their unfinished toils to offer up frankincense to the God ; invoking him with many names : — “
30222	30240	30241	30241	Thy	1802	” All these names and many more , for ages known — throughout the lands of Greece . “
30336	30439	30310	30310	Thou	1802	“ And thou dost guide thy lynxes , double - yoked , with showy harness . — Satyrs follow thee ; and Bacchanals , and old Silenus , drunk , unsteady on his staff ; jolting so rough on his small back - bent ass ; and all the way resounds a youthful clamour ; and the screams of women ! and the noise of tambourines ! And the hollow cymbals ! and the boxwood flutes , — fitted with measured holes . — Thou art implored by all Ismenian women to appear peaceful and mild ; and they perform thy rites . ”
30508	30560	30503	30503	anon	1813	“ While others loiter and frequent these rites fantastic , we the wards of Pallas , much to be preferred , by speaking novel thoughts may lighten labour . Let us each in turn , relate to an attentive audience , a novel tale ; and so the hours may glide . ”
31004	31085	31089	31089	they	1818	“ Thou envious wall why art thou standing in the way of those who die for love ? What harm could happen thee shouldst thou permit us to enjoy our love ? But if we ask too much , let us persuade that thou wilt open while we kiss but once : for , we are not ungrateful ; unto thee we own our debt ; here thou hast left a way that breathed words may enter loving ears . , ”
31505	31607	31502	31502	he	1844	“ Alas , one night has caused the ruin of two lovers ! Thou wert most deserving of completed days , but as for me , my heart is guilty ! I destroyed thee ! O my love ! I bade thee come out in the dark night to a lonely haunt , and failed to go before . Oh ! whatever lurks beneath this rock , though ravenous lion , tear my guilty flesh , and with most cruel jaws devour my cursed entrails ! What ? Not so ; it is a craven 's part to wish for death ! ”
31647	31660	31639	31639	he	1844	“ Kisses and tears are thine , receive my blood as well . ”
31949	31985	31940	31940	she	629	“ Ah Pyramus , what cruel fate has taken thy life away ? Pyramus ! Pyramus ! awake ! awake ! It is thy dearest Thisbe calls thee ! Lift thy drooping head ! Alas , ”
32036	32163	32033	32033	she	629	“ Thy own right hand , and thy great passion have destroyed thee ! — And I ? my hand shall be as bold as thine — my love shall nerve me to the fatal deed — thee , I will follow to eternity — though I be censured for the wretched cause , so surely I shall share thy wretched fate : — alas , whom death could me alone bereave , thou shalt not from my love be reft by death ! And , O ye wretched parents , mine and his , let our misfortunes and our pleadings melt your hearts , that ye no more deny to those whom constant love and lasting death unite — entomb us in a single sepulchre . “
32216	32323	32346	32347	the Sun	39	” No more she said ; and having fixed the point below her breast , she fell on the keen sword , still warm with his red blood . But though her death was out of Nature 's law her prayer was answered , for it moved the Gods and moved their parents . Now the Gods have changed the ripened fruit which darkens on the branch : and from the funeral pile their parents sealed their gathered ashes in a single urn . So ended she ; at once Leuconoe took the narrator 's thread ; and as she spoke her sisters all were silent . “
33067	33098	33062	33062	he	5013	“ Let thy twelve hand - maids leave us undisturbed , for I have things of close import to tell , and seemly , from a mother to her child . ”
33109	33157	33105	33106	the god	5013	“ Lo , I am he who measures the long year ; I see all things , and through me the wide world may see all things ; I am the glowing eye of the broad universe ! Thou art to me the glory of the earth ! ”
33314	33324	33291	33291	his	5013	“ For love of thee my life is lost . ”
33465	33476	33461	33461	he	1899	“ But naught shall hinder you to reach the skies . ”
33867	34252	33848	33848	she	622	“ The amours of the shepherd Daphnis , known to many of you , I shall not relate ; the shepherd Daphnis of Mount Ida , who was turned to stone obdurate , for the Nymph whose love he slighted — so the rivalry of love neglected rouses to revenge : neither shall I relate the story told of Scython , double - sexed , who first was man , then altered to a woman : so I pass the tale of Celmus turned to adamant , who reared almighty Jove from tender youth : so , likewise the Curetes whom the rain brought forth to life : Smilax and Crocus , too , transpeciated into little flowers : all these I pass to tell a novel tale , which haply may resolve in pleasant thoughts . Learn how the fountain , Salmacis , became so infamous ; learn how it enervates and softens the limbs of those who chance to bathe . Although the fountain 's properties are known , the cause is yet unknown . The Naiads nursed an infant son of Hermes , surely his of Aphrodite gotten in the caves of Ida , for the child resembled both the god and goddess , and his name was theirs . The years passed by , and when the boy had reached the limit of three lustrums , he forsook his native mountains ; for he loved to roam through unimagined places , by the banks of undiscovered rivers ; and the joy of finding wonders made his labour light . Leaving Mount Ida , where his youth was spent , he reached the land of Lycia , and from thence the verge of Caria , where a pretty pool of soft translucent water may be seen , so clear the glistening bottom glads the eye : no barren sedge , no fenny reeds annoy , no rushes with their sharpened arrow - points , but all around the edges of that pool the softest grass engirdles with its green . A Nymph dwells there , unsuited to the chase , unskilled to bend the bow , slothful of foot , the only Naiad in the world unknown to rapid - running Dian . Whensoever her Naiad sisters pled in winged words , “
34277	34436	34437	34439	O godlike youth	1916	” she only scorned the javelin and the quiver , nor joined her leisure to the active chase . Rather she bathes her smooth and shapely limbs ; or combs her tresses with a boxwood comb , Citorian ; or looking in the pool consults the glassed waters of effects increasing beauty ; or she decks herself in gauzy raiment , and reposing lolls on cushioned leaves , or grass - enverdured beds ; or gathers posies from the spangled lawns . Now , haply as she culled the sweetest flowers she saw the youth , and longing in her heart made havoc as her greedy eyes beheld . Although her love could scarcely brook delay , she waited to enhance her loveliness , in beauty hoping to allure his love . All richly dight she scanned herself and robes , to know that every charm should fair appear , and she be worthy : wherefore she began : “
34537	34657	34658	34658	I	0	” So she spoke , and stood in silence waiting for the youth 's reply . He knows nor cares for love — with loveliness the mounting blushes tinge his youthful cheeks , as blush - red tint of apples on the tree , ripe in the summer sun , or as the hue of painted ivory , or the round moon red - blushing in her splendour , when the clash of brass resounds in vain . And long the Nymph implored ; almost clung on his neck , as smooth and white as ivory ; unceasingly imploring him to kiss her , though as chaste as kisses to a sister ; but the youth outwearied , thus : “
34681	34687	34670	34670	I	0	” Affrighted then said Salmacis , “
34699	34922	34923	34923	I	0	” Although she made fair presence to retire , she hid herself , that from a shrub - grown covert , on her knees she might observe unseen . As any boy that heedless deems his mischief unobserved , now here now there , he rambled on the green ; now in the bubbly ripples dipped his feet , now dallied in the clear pool ankle - deep ; — the warm - cool feeling of the liquid then , so pleased him , that without delay he doffed his fleecy garments from his tender limbs . Ah , Salmacis , amazement is thy meed ! Thou art consumed to know his naked grace ! As the hot glitters of the round bright sun collected , sparkle from the polished plate , thine eyes are glistened with delirious fires . Delay she can not ; panting for his joy , languid for his caressing , crazed , distract , her passion difficult is held in check . — He claps his body with his hollow palms and lightly vaults into the limped wave , and darting through the water hand over hand shines in the liquid element , as though should one enhance a statue 's ivorine , or glaze the lily in a lake of glass . And thus the Naiad , “
34938	35097	35098	35098	You	1929	” Quickly disrobed , she plunged into the yielding wave — seized him , caressed him , clung to him a thousand ways , kissed him , thrust down her hands and touched his breast : reluctant and resisting he endeavours to make escape , but even as he struggles she winds herself about him , as entwines the serpent which the royal bird on high holds in his talons ; — as it hangs , it coils in sinuous folds around the eagle 's feet ; — twisting its coils around his head and wings : or as the ivy clings to sturdy oaks ; or as the polypus beneath the waves , by pulling down , with suckers on all sides , tenacious holds its prey . And yet the youth , descendant of great Atlas , not relents nor gives the Naiad joy . Pressing her suit she winds her limbs around him and exclaims , “
35137	35272	35274	35274	me	0	” Propitious deities accord her prayers : the mingled bodies of the pair unite and fashion in a single human form . So one might see two branches underneath a single rind uniting grow as one : so , these two bodies in a firm embrace no more are twain , but with a two - fold form nor man nor woman may be called — Though both in seeming they are neither one of twain . When that Hermaphroditus felt the change , so wrought upon him by the languid fount , considered that he entered it a man , and now his limbs relaxing in the stream he is not wholly male , but only half , — he lifted up his hands and thus implored , albeit with no manly voice ; “
35315	35779	35782	35789	the offspring of a concubine transform Maeonian mariners	1939	” Moved by the words of their bi - natured son both parents yield assent : they taint the fount with essences of dual - working powers . Now though the daughters of King Minyas have made an end of telling tales , they make no end of labour ; for they so despise the deity , and desecrate his feast . While busily engaged , with sudden beat they hear resounding tambourines ; and pipes and crooked horns and tinkling brass renew , unseen , the note ; saffron and myrrh dissolve in dulcet odours ; and , beyond belief , the woven webs , dependent on the loom , take tints of green , put forth new ivy leaves , or change to grape - vines verdant . There the thread is twisted into tendrils , there the warp is fashioned into many - moving leaves — the purple lends its splendour to the grape . And now the day is past ; it is the hour when night ambiguous merges into day , which dubious owns nor light nor dun obscure ; and suddenly the house begins to shake , and torches oil - dipped seem to flare around , and fires a - glow to shine in every room , and phantoms , feigned of savage beasts , to howl . — Full of affright amid the smoking halls the sisters vainly hide , and wheresoever they deem security from flaming fires , fearfully flit . And while they seek to hide , a membrane stretches over every limb , and light wings open from their slender arms . In the weird darkness they are unaware what measure wrought to change their wonted shape . No plumous vans avail to lift their flight , yet fair they balance on membraneous wing . Whenever they would speak a tiny voice , diminutive , apportioned to their size , in squeaking note complains . Adread the light , their haunts avoid by day the leafy woods , for sombre attics , where secure they rest till forth the dun obscure their wings may stretch at hour of Vesper ; — this accords their name . Throughout the land of Thebes miraculous the power of Bacchus waxed ; and far and wide Ino , his aunt , reported the great deeds by this divinity performed . Of all her sisters only she escaped unharmed , when Fate destroyed them , and she knew not grief — only for sorrow of her sisters ' woes . — While Ino vaunted of her mother - joys , and of her kingly husband , Athamas , and of the mighty God , her foster - child ; Juno , disdaining her in secret , said ; “
35897	36352	36356	36356	he	1947	” A shelving path in shadows of sad yew through utter silence to the deep descends , infernal , where the languid Styx exhales vapours ; and there the shadows of the dead , descend , after they leave their sacred urns , and ghostly forms invade : and far and wide , those dreary regions Horror and bleak Cold obtain . The ghosts , arrived , not know the way , — which leadeth to the Stygian city - gates , — not know the melancholy palace where the swarthy Pluto stays , though streets and ways a thousand to that city lead , and gates out - swing from every side : and as the sea with never - seen increase engulfs the streams unnumbered of the world , that realm enfolds the souls of men , nor ever is it filled . Around the shadowy spirits go ; bloodless boneless and bodiless ; they throng the place of judgment , or they haunt the mansion where abides the Utmost Tyrant , or they tend to various callings , as their whilom way ; — appropriate punishment confines to pain the multitude condemned . To this abode , impelled by rage and hate , from habitation celestial , Juno , of Saturn born , descends , submissive to its dreadful element . No sooner had she entered the sad gates , than groans were uttered by the threshold , pressed by her immortal form , and Cerberus upraising his three - visaged mouths gave vent to triple - barking howls . — She called to her the sisters , Night - begot , implacable , terrific Furies . They did sit before the prison portals , adamant confined , combing black vipers from their horrid hair . When her amid the night - surrounding shades they recognized , those Deities uprose . O dread confines ! dark seat of wretched vice ! Where stretched athwart nine acres , Tityus , must thou endure thine entrails to be torn ! O Tantalus , thou canst not touch the wave , and from thy clutch the hanging branches rise ! O Sisyphus , thou canst not stay the stone , catching or pushing , it must fall again ! O thou Ixion ! whirled around , around , thyself must follow to escape thyself ! And , O Belides , ( plotter of sad death upon thy cousins ) thou art always doomed to dip forever ever - spilling waves ! When that the daughter of Saturnus fixed a stern look on those wretches , first her glance arrested on Ixion ; but the next on Sisyphus ; and thus the goddess spoke ; — “
36386	36472	36380	36381	his wife	1380	” So grieved she , and expressed the rage of hate that such descent inspired , beseeching thus , no longer should the House of Cadmus stand , so that the sister Furies plunge in crime overweening Athamas . — Entreating them , she mingled promises with her commands . — When Juno ended speech , Tisiphone , whose locks entangled are not ever smooth , tossed them around , that backward from her face such crawling snakes were thrown ; — then answered she : “
36508	36908	36911	36912	my lads	1956	” Rejoicing Juno hastens to the clouds — before she enters her celestial home , Iris , the child of Thaumas , purifies her limbs in sprinkled water . Waiting not , Tisiphone , revengeful , takes a torch ; — besmeared with blood , and vested in a robe , dripping with crimson gore , and twisting - snakes engirdled , she departs her dire abode — with twitching Madness , Terror , Fear and Woe : and when she had arrived the destined house , the door - posts shrank from her , the maple doors turned ashen grey : the Sun amazed fled . Affrighted , Athamas and Ino viewed and fled these prodigies ; but suddenly that baneful Fury stood across the way , blocking the passage — There she stands with arms extended , and alive with twisting vipers . — She shakes her hair ; the moving serpents hiss ; they cling upon her shoulders , and they glide around her temples , dart their fangs , and vomit corruption . — Plucking from the midst two snakes , she hurls them with her pestilential hand upon her victims , Athamas and Ino , whom , although the vipers strike upon their breasts , no injury attacks their mortal parts ; — only their minds are stricken with wild rage , inciting to mad violence and crime . And with a monstrous composite of foam — once gathered from the mouth of Cerberus , the venom of Echidna , purposeless aberrances , crimes , tears , hatred — the lust of homicide , and the dark vapourings of foolish brains ; a liquid poison , mixed , and mingled with fresh blood , in hollow brass , and boiled , and stirred up with a slip of hemlock — she took of it , and as they trembled , threw that mad - mixed poison on them ; and it scorched their inmost vitals — and she waved her torch repeatedly , within a circle 's rim — and added flame to flame . — Then , confident of having executed her commands , the Fury hastened to the void expanse where Pluto reigns , and swiftly put aside the serpents that were wreathed around her robes . At once , the son of Aeolus , enraged , shouts loudly in his palace ; “
36936	37056	37059	37059	Bacche	667	” In his madness he believes his wife a savage beast . He follows her , and quickly from her bosom snatches up her smiling babe , Learchus , holding forth his tiny arms , and whirls him in the air , times twice and thrice , as whirls the whizzing sling , and dashes him in pieces on the rocks ; — cracking his infant bones . The mother , roused to frenzy ( who can tell if grief the cause , or fires of scattered poison ? ) yells aloud , and with her torn hair tangled , running mad , she carries swiftly in her clutching arms , her little Melicerta ! and begins to shout , “
37061	37080	37059	37059	Bacche	667	” — Juno hears the shouted name of Bacchus , and she laughs , and taunts her ; — “
37088	37189	37059	37059	Bacche	667	” There is a crag , out - jutting on the deep , worn hollow at the base by many waves , where not the rain may ripple on that pool ; — high up the rugged summit overhangs its ragged brows above the open sea : there , Ino climbs with frenzy - given strength , and fearless , with her burden in her arms , leaps in the waves where whitening foams arise . Venus takes pity on her guiltless child , unfortunate grand - daughter , and begins to soothe her uncle Neptune with these words ; — “
37279	37411	37412	37412	I	0	” Neptune regards her prayer : he takes from them their mortal dross : he clothes in majesty , and hallows their appearance . Even their names and forms are altered ; Melicerta , changed , is now Palaemon called , and Ino , changed , Leucothoe called , are known as Deities . When her Sidonian attendants traced fresh footprints to the last verge of the rock , and found no further vestige , they declared her dead , nor had they any doubt of it . They tore their garments and their hair — and wailed the House of Cadmus — and they cursed at Juno , for the sad fate of the wretched concubine . That goddess could no longer brook their words , and thus made answer , “
37423	37442	37412	37412	I	0	” Her words were instantly confirmed — The one whose love for Ino was the greatest , cried ; “
37456	37683	37451	37451	I	0	” But even as she tried to leap , she stood fast - rooted to the ever - living rock ; another , as she tried to beat her breast with blows repeated , noticed that her arms grew stiff and hard ; another , as by chance , was petrified with hands stretched over the waves : another could be seen , as suddenly her fingers hardened , clutching at her hair to tear it from the roots . — And each remained forever in the posture first assumed . — But others of those women , sprung from Cadmus , were changed to birds , that always with wide wings skim lightly the dark surface of that sea . Unwitting that his daughter and his son are Ocean deities , Agenor 's son , — depressed by sorrow and unnumbered woes , calamities , and prodigies untold , — the founder fled the city he had built , as though fatalities that gathered round that city grieved him deeper than the fate of his own family ; and thence , at last arrived the confines of Illyria ; in exile with his wife . — Weighted with woe , bowed down with years , their minds recalled the time when first disaster fell upon their House : — relating their misfortunes , Cadmus spoke ; “
37747	37840	37738	37738	I	0	” Even as he spoke , he saw and felt himself increase in length . His body coiled into a serpent 's form ; bright scale 's enveloped his indurate skin , and azure macules in speckled pride , enriched his glowing folds ; and as he fell supinely on his breast , his legs were joined , and gradually tapered as a serpent 's tail . — Some time his arms remained , which stretching forth while tears rolled down his human face , not changed as yet , he said ; “
37882	37934	37937	37937	Cadmus	561	” So did he speak , nor thought to make an end ; but suddenly his tongue became twin - forked . As often as he tried , a hissing sound escaped ; the only voice that Nature left him . — And his wife bewailed , and smote her breast , “
37998	38541	38547	38547	thou	1980	” — So ended her complaint . Cadmus caressed her gently with his tongue ; and slid to her dear bosom , just as if he knew his wife ; and he embraced her , and he touched her neck . All their attendants , who had seen the change , were filled with fear ; but when as crested snakes the twain appeared in brightly glistening mail , their grief was lightened : and the pair , enwreathed in twisting coils , departed from that place , and sought a covert in the nearest grove . — There , then , these gentle serpents never shun mankind , nor wound , nor strike with poisoned fangs ; for they are always conscious of the past . The fortune of their grandson , Bacchus , gave great comfort to them — as a god adored in conquered India ; by Achaia praised in stately temples . — But Acrisius the son of Abas , of the Cadmean race , remained to banish Bacchus from the walls of Argos , and to lift up hostile arms against that deity , who he denied was born to Jove . He would not even grant that Perseus from the loins of Jupiter was got of Danae in the showering gold . So mighty is the hidden power of truth , Acrisius soon lamented that affront to Bacchus , and that ever he refused to own his grandson ; for the one achieved high heaven , and the other , ( as he bore the viperous monster - head ) on sounding wings hovered a conqueror in the fluent air , over sands , Libyan , where the Gorgon - head dropped clots of gore , that , quickening on the ground , became unnumbered serpents ; fitting cause to curse with vipers that infested land . Thence wafted by the never - constant winds through boundless latitudes , now here now there , as flits a vapour - cloud in dizzy flight , down - looking from the lofty skies on earth , removed far , so compassed he the world . Three times did he behold the frozen Bears , times thrice his gaze was on the Crab 's bent arms . Now shifting to the west , now to the east , how often changed his course ? Time came , when day declining , he began to fear the night , by which he stopped his flight far in the west — the realm of Atlas — where he sought repose till Lucifer might call Aurora 's fires ; Aurora chariot of the Day . There dwelt huge Atlas , vaster than the race of man : son of Iapetus , his lordly sway extended over those extreme domains , and over oceans that command their waves to take the panting coursers of the Sun , and bathe the wearied Chariot of the Day . For him a thousand flocks , a thousand herds overwandered pasture fields ; and neighbour tribes might none disturb that land . Aglint with gold bright leaves adorn the trees , — boughs golden - wrought bear apples of pure gold . And Perseus spoke to Atlas , “
38594	38615	38586	38586	I	0	” But Atlas , mindful of an oracle since by Themis , the Parnassian , told , recalled these words , “
38647	38686	38699	38699	Jupiter	475	” Fearful of this , Atlas had built solid walls around his orchard , and secured a dragon , huge , that kept perpetual guard , and thence expelled all strangers from his land . Wherefore he said , “
38706	38746	38699	38699	Jupiter	475	” With that he added force and strove to drive the hesitating Alien from his doors ; who pled reprieve or threatened with bold words . Although he dared not rival Atlas ' might , Perseus made this reply ; “
38762	39044	38760	38760	yours	475	” He said no more , but turning his own face , he showed upon his left Medusa 's head , abhorrent features . — Atlas , huge and vast , becomes a mountain — His great beard and hair are forests , and his shoulders and his hands mountainous ridges , and his head the top of a high peak ; — his bones are changed to rocks . Augmented on all sides , enormous height attains his growth ; for so ordained it , ye , O mighty Gods ! who now the heavens ' expanse unnumbered stars , on him command to rest . In their eternal prison , Aeous , grandson of Hippotas , had shut the winds ; and Lucifer , reminder of our toil , in splendour rose upon the lofty sky : and Perseus bound his wings upon his feet , on each foot bound he them ; his sword he girt and sped wing - footed through the liquid air . Innumerous kingdoms far behind were left , till peoples Ethiopic and the lands of Cepheus were beneath his lofty view . There Ammon , the Unjust , had made decree Andromeda , the Innocent , should grieve her mother 's tongue . They bound her fettered arms fast to the rock . When Perseus her beheld as marble he would deem her , but the breeze moved in her hair , and from her streaming eyes the warm tears fell . Her beauty so amazed his heart , unconscious captive of her charms , that almost his swift wings forgot to wave . — Alighted on the ground , he thus began ; “
39081	39232	39247	39247	I	0	” A moment then , as overcome with shame , she made no sound : were not she fettered she would surely hide her blushing head ; but what she could perform that did she do — she filled her eyes with tears . So pleaded he that lest refusal seem implied confession of a crime , she told her name , her country 's name , and how her charms had been her mother 's pride . But as she spoke the mighty ocean roared . Over the waves a monster fast approached , its head held high , abreast the wide expanse . — The virgin shrieked ; — no aid her wretched father gave , nor aid her still more wretched mother ; but they wept and mingled lamentations with their tears — clinging distracted to her fettered form . And thus the stranger spoke to them , “
39363	40265	40268	40269	valiant Perseus	673	” To this her parents gave a glad assent , for who could hesitate ? And they entreat , and promise him the kingdom as a dower . As a great ship with steady prow speeds on ; forced forwards by the sweating arms of youth it plows the deep ; so , breasting the great waves , the monster moved , until to reach the rock no further space remained than might the whirl of Balearic string encompass , through the middle skies , with plummet - mold of lead . That instant , spurning with his feet the ground , the youth rose upwards to a cloudy height ; and when the shadow of the hero marked the surface of the sea , the monster sought vainly to vent his fury on the shade . As the swift bird of Jove , when he beholds a basking serpent in an open field , exposing to the sun its mottled back , and seizes on its tail ; lest it shall turn to strike with venomed fang , he fixes fast his grasping talons in the scaly neck ; so did the winged youth , in rapid flight through yielding elements , press down on the great monster 's back , and thrust his sword , sheer to the hilt , in its right shoulder — loud its frightful torture sounded over the waves . — So fought the hero - son of Inachus . Wild with the grievous wound , the monster rears high in the air , or plunges in the waves ; — or wheels around as turns the frightened boar shunning the hounds around him in full cry . The hero on his active wings avoids the monster 's jaws , and with his crooked sword tortures its back wherever he may pierce its mail of hollow shell , or strikes betwixt the ribs each side , or wounds its lashing tail , long , tapered as a fish . The monster spouts forth streams — incarnadined with blood — that spray upon the hero 's wings ; who drenched , and heavy with the spume , no longer dares to trust existence to his dripping wings ; but he discerns a rock , which rises clear above the water when the sea is calm , but now is covered by the lashing waves . On this he rests ; and as his left hand holds firm on the upmost ledge , he thrusts his sword , times more than three , unswerving in his aim , sheer through the monster 's entrails . — Shouts of praise resound along the shores , and even the Gods may hear his glory in their high abodes . Her parents , Cepheus and Cassiope , most joyfully salute their son - in - law ; declaring him the saviour of their house . And now , her chains struck off , the lovely cause and guerdon of his toil , walks on the shore . The hero washes his victorious hands in water newly taken from the sea : but lest the sand upon the shore might harm the viper - covered head , he first prepared a bed of springy leaves , on which he threw weeds of the sea , produced beneath the waves . On them he laid Medusa 's awful face , daughter of Phorcys ; — and the living weeds , fresh taken from the boundless deep , imbibed the monster 's poison in their spongy pith : they hardened at the touch , and felt in branch and leaf unwonted stiffness . Sea - Nymphs , too , attempted to perform that prodigy on numerous other weeds , with like result : so pleased at their success , they raised new seeds , from plants wide - scattered on the salt expanse . Even from that day the coral has retained such wondrous nature , that exposed to air it hardens . — Thus , a plant beneath the waves becomes a stone when taken from the sea . Three altars to three Gods he made of turf . To thee , victorious Virgin , did he build an altar on the right , to Mercury an altar on the left , and unto Jove an altar in the midst . He sacrificed a heifer to Minerva , and a calf to Mercury , the Wingfoot , and a bull to thee , O greatest of the Deities . Without a dower he takes Andromeda , the guerdon of his glorious victory , nor hesitates . — Now pacing in the van , both Love and Hymen wave the flaring torch , abundant perfumes lavished in the flames . The houses are bedecked with wreathed flowers ; and lyres and flageolets resound , and songs — felicit notes that happy hearts declare . The portals opened , sumptuous halls display their golden splendours , and the noble lords of Cepheus ' court take places at the feast , magnificently served . After the feast , when every heart was warming to the joys of genial Bacchus , then , Lyncidian Perseus asked about the land and its ways about the customs and the character of its heroes . Straightway one of the dinner - companions made reply , and asked in turn , “
40302	40303	40293	40293	you	673	” “
40307	40316	40293	40293	you	673	” continued Perseus of the house of Agenor , “
40421	40476	40417	40418	the Gorgon	689	“ Along the way , in fields and by the roads , I saw on all sides men and animals — like statues — turned to flinty stone at sight of dread Medusa 's visage . Nevertheless reflected on the brazen shield , I bore upon my left , I saw her horrid face . “
40527	40619	40510	40514	To winged Pegasus the blood	2003	” So did he speak , and truly told besides the perils of his journey , arduous and long — He told of seas and lands that far beneath him he had seen , and of the stars that he had touched while on his waving wings . And yet , before they were aware , the tale was ended ; he was silent . Then rejoined a noble with enquiry why alone of those three sisters , snakes were interspersed in dread Medusa 's locks . And he replied : — “
40871	40905	40908	40908	he	2021	“ Ha , ' tis I ! I come avenger of my ravished bride ! Let now your flittering wings deliver you , or even Jupiter , dissolved in showers of imitation gold . ”
40922	40967	40920	40920	Cepheus	680	“ Hold your hand , and strike him not ! What strange delusions , O my brother , have compelled you to this crime ? Is it the just requital of heroic worth ? A fair reguerdon for the life of her you loved ? “
41060	41142	41144	41144	him	2028	“ And was it not enough for you to stand supinely by , while she was bound in chains , and offer no assistance , though you were her lover and betrothed ? And will you grieve that she was rescued from a dreadful fate , and spoil her champion of his just rewards ? Rewards that now may seem magnificent , but not denied to you if you had won and saved , when she was fettered to the rock . “
41183	41643	41655	41655	you	2032	” not deigning to reply , against them Phineus stood ; and glancing back from him to Perseus , with alternate looks , as doubtful which should feel his first attack , made brief delay . Then vain at Perseus hurled his spear , with all the force that rage inspired , but , missing him it quivered in a couch . Provoked beyond endurance Perseus leaped forth from the cushioned seats , and fiercely sent that outwrenched weapon back . It would have pierced his hostile breast had not the miscreant crouched behind the altars . Oh perverted good , that thus an altar should abet the wrong ! But , though the craven Phineus escaped , not vainly flew the whizzing point , but struck in Rhoetus ' forehead . As the barb was torn out of the bone , the victim 's heels began to kick upon the floor , and spouting blood defiled the festal board . Then truly flame in uncontrolled rage the vulgar crowd , and hurl their harmful darts . And there are some who hold that Cepheus and his son - in - law deserved to die ; but Cepheus had passed forth the threshold of his palace : having called on all the Gods of Hospitality and Truth and Justice to attest , he gave no comfort to the enemies of Peace . Unconquered Pallas is at hand and holds her Aegis to protect her brother 's life ; she lends him dauntless courage . At the feast was one from India 's distant shores , whose name was Athis . It was said that Limnate , the daughter of the River Ganges , him in vitreous caverns bright had brought to birth ; and now at sixteen summers in his prime , the handsome youth was clad in costly robes . A purple mantle with a golden fringe covered his shoulders , and a necklace , carved of gold , enhanced the beauty of his throat . His hair encompassed with a coronal , delighted with sweet myrrh . Well taught was he to hurl the javelin at a distant mark , and none with better skill could stretch the bow . No sooner had he bent the pliant horns than Perseus , with a smoking billet , seized from the mid - altar , struck him on the face , and smashed his features in his broken skull . And when Assyrian Lycabas had seen his dear companion , whom he truly loved , beating his handsome countenance in blood . And when he had bewailed his lost life , that ebbed away from that unpiteous wound , he snatched the bow that Athis used , and said ; “
41668	42009	41655	41655	you	2032	” So speaking , forth the piercing arrow bounded from the cord , which , though avoided , struck the hero 's cloak and fastened in its folds . — Then Perseus turned upon him , with the trusted curving sword , cause of Medusa 's death , and drove the blade deep in his breast . The dying victim 's eyes , now swimming in a shadowous night , looked ' round for Athis , whom , beholding , he reclined upon , and ushered to the other world , — sad consolation of united death . And Phorbas the descendant of Methion . Who hailed from far Syene , with his friend Amphimedon of Libya , in their haste to join the battle , slipped up in the blood and fell together : just as they arose that glittering sword was driven through the throat of Phorbas into the ribs of his companion . But Erithus , the son of Actor , swung a battle - ax , so weighty , Perseus chose not combat with his curving blade . He seized in his two hands a huge bowl , wrought around with large design , outstanding from its mass . This , lifting up , he dashes on his foe , who vomits crimson blood , and falling back beats on the hard floor with his dying head . And next he slew Caucasian Abaris , and Polydaemon — from Semiramis nobly descended — and Sperchius , son , Lycetus , long - haired Elyces , unshorn , Clytus and Phlegias , the hero slew ; — and trampled on the dying heaped around . Not daring to engage his enemy in open contest , Phineus held aloof , and hurled his javelin . Badly aimed — by some mischance or turned — it wounded Idas , who had followed neither side ; vain - hoping thus to shun the conflict . Idas , filled with rage , on Phineus gazed with futile hate , and said , “
42040	42339	42342	42342	your	2036	” So speaking , from the wound he drew the steel , but , faint from loss of blood , before his arm could hurl the weapon back , he sank upon his knees . Here , also , lies Odytes , — noblest of the Cephenes , save Cepheus only , — slaughtered by the sword of Clymenus . And Prothoenor lies the victim of Hypseus ; by his side Hypseus slaughtered by Lyncidas falls . And in the midst of this destruction stood Emathion , now an aged man , revered , who feared the Gods , and stood for upright deeds . And , since his years denied him strength for war , he battled with his tongue , and railed , and cursed their impious weapons . As that aged man clings to the altar with his trembling hands , Chromis with ruthless sword cuts off his head , which straightway falls upon the altar , whence his dying tongue denounces them in words of execration : and his soul expires amid the altar flames . Then Broteas and Ammon , his twin brother , who not knew their equals at the cestus , by the hand of Phineus fell ; for what avails in deed the cestus as a weapon matched with swords . Ampycus by the same hand fell , — the priest of Ceres , with his temples wreathed in white . And O , Iapetides not for this did you attend the feast ! Your voice attuned melodious to the harp , was in request to celebrate the wedding - day with song , — a work of peace ; as you did stand aside , holding the peaceful plectrum in your hand , the mocking Pettalus in ridicule said , “
42349	42589	42342	42342	your	2036	” And , mocking thus , he drove his pointed sword in your right temple . As your limbs gave way , your dying fingers swept the tuneful strings : and falling you did chant a mournful dirge . — You to avenge enraged Lycormas tore a huge bar from the door - post , on the right , and dashing it against the mocker crushed his neck - bones : as a slaughtered bullock falls — he tumbled to the ground . Then on the left . Cinyphian Pelates began to wrench an oak plank from the door - post , but the spear of Corythus , the son of Marmarus , pinioned his right hand to the wooden post ; and while he struggled Abas pierced his side . — He fell not to the floor , but dying hung suspended from the door - post by his hand . And of the friends of Perseus , Melaneus was slain , and Dorylas whose wealth was large in Nasamonian land . No other lord , as Dorylas , such vast estates possessed ; no other owned so many heaps of corn . The missile steel stood fastened in his groin , obliquely fixed , — a fatal spot — and when the author of his wound , Halcyoneus the Bactrian , beheld his victim thus , rolling his eyes and sobbing forth his soul , he railed ; “
42604	43171	42342	42342	your	2036	” And he left the bleeding corpse . But Perseus in revenge hurled after him a spear , which , in his need , he ripped out from the wound , yet warm , and struck the boaster on the middle of his nose . The piercing steel , passed through his nose and neck , — remained projecting from the front and back . And while good fortune helped his hand , he slew Clanis and Clytius , of one mother born , but with a different wound he slaughtered each : for , leveled by a mighty arm , his ashen spear drove through the thighs of Clytius , right and left , and Clanis bit the javelin with his teeth . And by his might , Mendesian Celadon and Atreus fell , his mother of the tribes of Palestine , his father was unknown . Aethion , also , who could well foresee the things to come , but was at last deceived by some false omen . And Thoactes fell , the armour - bearer of the king ; and , next , the infamous Agyrtes who had slain his father . These he slew ; and though his strength was nearly spent , so many more remained : for now the multitude with one accord conspired to slaughter him . From every side the raging troops assailed the better cause . In vain the pious father and the bride , together with her mother , fill the halls with lamentations ; for the clash of arms , the groans of fallen heroes drown their cries . — Bellona in a sea of blood has drenched their Household Gods , polluted by these deeds , and she endeavours to renew the strife . Perseus , alone against that raging throng , is now surrounded by a myriad men , led on by Phineus ; and their flying darts , as thick as wintry tail , are showered around on every side , grazing his eyes and ears . — Quickly he fixed his shoulder firm against the rock of a great pillar , which secured his back from danger , and he faced his foes , and baffled their attack . Upon his left Chaonian Molpeus pressed , and on his right a Nabathe an called Ethemon pressed . — As when a tiger from a valley hears the lowing of two herds , in separate fields , though hunger urges he not knows on which to spring , but rages equally for each ; so , Perseus doubtful which may first attack his left or right , knows not on which to turn , but stands attentive witness to the flight of Molpeus , whom he wounded in the leg . Nor could he choose — Ethemon , full of rage , pressed on him to inflict a fatal wound , deep in his neck ; but with incautious force struck the stone pillar with his ringing sword and shattered the metal blade , close to the hilt ; the flying fragment pierced its owner 's neck , but not with mortal wound . In vain he pled for mercy , stretching forth his helpless arms : perseus transfixed him with his glittering blade , Cyllenian . But when he saw his strength was yielding to the multitude , he said , “
43201	43214	43189	43190	O friends	2040	” And he raised Medusa , s head . Thescelus answered him ; “
43223	43330	43335	43336	O Perseus	673	” Just as he prepared to hurl the deadly javelin from his hand , he stood , unmoving in that attitude , a marble statue . Ampyx , close to him , exulting in a mighty spirit , made a lunge to pierce Lyncides in the breast ; but , as his sword was flashing in the air , his right arm grew so rigid , there he stood unable to draw back or thrust it forth . But Nileus , who had feigned himself begot by seven - fold Nile , and carved his shield with gold and silver streams , alternate seven , shouted ; “
43369	43405	43406	43406	Your	673	” But in the midst of boasting , the last words were silenced ; and his open mouth , although incapable of motion , seemed intent to utter speech . Then Eryx , chiding says ; “
43435	43693	43424	43429	this youthful mover of magician charms	2042	” — He started with a rush ; the earth detained his steps ; it held him fast ; he could not speak ; he stood , complete with arms , a statue . Such a penalty was theirs , and justly earned ; but near by there was one , aconteus , who defending Perseus , saw medusa as he fought ; and at the sight the soldier hardened to an upright stone . — Assured he was alive , Astyages now struck him with his long sword , but the blade resounded with a ringing note ; and there , astonished at the sound , Astyages , himself , assumed that nature ; and remained with wonder pictured on his marble face . And not to weary with the names of men , sprung from the middle classes , there remained two hundred warriors eager for the fight — as soon as they could see Medusa 's face , two hundred warriors stiffened into stone . At last , repentant , Phineus dreads the war , unjust , for in a helpless fright he sees the statues standing in strange attitudes ; and , recognizing his adherents , calls on each by name to rescue from that death . Still unbelieving he begins to touch the bodies , nearest to himself , and all are hard stone . Having turned his eyes away , he stretched his hands and arms obliquely back to Perseus , and confessed his wicked deeds ; and thus imploring spoke ; “
43749	43786	43790	43791	the craven	2047	“ Thy merit proved thy valid claim , and time gave argument for mine . It grieves me not to yield , O bravest , only give me life , and all the rest be thine . ”
43811	43915	43916	43916	He	2048	“ I will grant to you , O timid - hearted Phineus ! as behoves your conduct ; and it should appear a gift , magnanimous , to one who fears to move . — Take courage , for no steel shall violate your carcase ; and , moreover , you shall be a monument , that ages may record your unforgotten name . You shall be seen thus always , in the palace where resides my father - in - law , that my surrendered spouse may soften her great grief when she but sees the darling image of her first betrothed . ”
44140	44156	44137	44137	Perseus	673	“ By this we give our true pledge of the truth , avert your eyes ! ”
44270	44352	44254	44254	she	694	“ Fame has given to me the knowledge of a new - made fountain — gift of Pegasus , that fleet steed , from the blood of dread Medusa sprung — it opened when his hard hoof struck the ground . — It is the cause that brought me . — For my longing to have seen this fount , miraculous and wonderful , grows not the less in that myself did see the swift steed , nascent from maternal blood . ”
44358	44400	44355	44355	Urania	748	“ Whatever the cause that brings thee to our habitation , thou , O goddess , art to us the greatest joy . And now , to answer thee , reports are true ; this fountain is the work of Pegasus , ”
44487	44580	44480	44482	one of them	2067	“ O thou whose valour gave thy mind to greater deeds ! if thou hadst stooped to us , Minerva , we had welcomed thee most worthy of our choir ! Thy words are true ; and well hast thou approved the joys of art , and this retreat . Most happy would we be if only we were safe ; but wickedness admits of no restraint , and everything affrights our virgin minds ; and everywhere the dreadful Pyrenaeus haunts our sight ; — scarcely have we recovered from the shock . “
44679	44729	44740	44740	Pyrenaeus	749	“ Moved by his words , and by the growing storm , we gave assent , and entered his first house . But presently the storm abated , and the southern wind was conquered by the north ; the black clouds fled , and soon the skies were clear . “
44835	44921	44960	44960	she	5249	” So spoke the Muse . And now was heard the sound of pennons in the air , and voices , too , gave salutations from the lofty trees . Minerva , thinking they were human tongues , looked up in question whence the perfect words ; but on the boughs , nine ugly magpies perched , those mockers of all sounds , which now complained their hapless fate . And as she wondering stood , Urania , goddess of the Muse , rejoined ; — “
45158	45371	45139	45141	the chosen Nymphs	2093	“ At once , although the lot had not been cast , the leading sister hastened to begin . — She chanted of celestial wars ; she gave the Giants false renown ; she gave the Gods small credit for great deeds . — She droned out , ‘ Forth , those deepest realms of earth , Typhoeus came , and filled the Gods with fear . They turned their backs in flight to Egypt ; and the wearied rout , where Great Nile spreads his seven - channeled mouth , were there received . — Thither the earth - begot Typhoeus hastened : but the Gods of Heaven deceptive shapes assumed . — Lo , Jupiter , ( As Libyan Ammon 's crooked horns attest ) was hidden in the leader of a flock ; Apollo in a crow ; Bacchus in a goat ; Diana in a cat ; Venus in a fish ; Saturnian Juno in a snow - white cow ; Cyllenian Hermes in an Ibis ' wings . ’ — Such stuff she droned out from her noisy mouth : and then they summoned us ; but , haply , time permits thee not , nor leisure thee permits , that thou shouldst hearken to our melodies . ”
45372	45378	45441	45441	she	757	“ Nay doubt it not , ”
45382	45390	45392	45392	she	2094	“ but relate your melodies in order . ”
45407	45417	45405	45405	Urania	748	“ On our side we trusted all to one . ”
45448	45504	45433	45433	She	757	“ First Ceres broke with crooked plow the glebe ; first gave to earth its fruit and wholesome food ; first gave the laws ; — all things of Ceres came ; of her I sing ; and oh , that I could tell her worth in verse ; in verse her worth is due . “
45675	45708	45709	45709	Him	2106	“ He circumspectly viewed Sicilia 's vast foundations . — Having well explored and proved no part was shattered ; having laid aside his careful fears , he wandered in those parts . “
45932	45995	45928	45928	Venus	996	“ Cupid then loosed his quiver , and of all its many arrows , by his mother 's aid , selected one ; the keenest of them all ; the least uncertain , surest from the string : and having fixed his knee against the bow , bent back the flexile horn . — The flying shaft struck Pluto in the breast . “
46082	46140	46141	46142	The goddess	4979	“ While Proserpine once dallied in that grove , plucking white lilies and sweet violets , and while she heaped her basket , while she filled her bosom , in a pretty zeal to strive beyond all others ; she was seen , beloved , and carried off by Pluto — such the haste of sudden love . “
46202	46291	46328	46328	Cyane	767	“ The ravisher urged on his chariot , and inspired his steeds ; called each by name , and on their necks and manes shook the black - rusted reins . They hastened through deep lakes , and through the pools of Palici , which boiling upward from the ruptured earth smell of strong sulphur . And they bore him thence to where the sons of Bacchus , who had sailed from twin - sea Corinth , long ago had built a city 's walls between unequal ports . “
46462	46572	46447	46447	she	5012	“ The son of Saturn blazed with uncontrolled rage ; and urged his steeds , and hurled his royal scepter in the pool . Cast with a mighty arm it pierced the deeps . The smitten earth made way to Tartarus ; — it opened a wide basin and received the plunging chariot in the midst . — But now the mournful Cyane began to grieve , because from her against her fountain - rights the goddess had been torn . The deepening wound still rankled in her breast , and she dissolved in many tears , and wasted in those waves which lately were submissive to her rule . “
46673	46775	46779	46779	she	5012	“ Now it befell when Proserpine was lost , her anxious mother sought through every land and every sea in vain . She rested not . Aurora , when she came with ruddy locks , might never know , nor even Hesperus , if she might deign to rest . — She lit two pines from Aetna 's flames and held one in each hand , and restless bore them through the frosty glooms : and when serene the day had dimmed the stars she sought her daughter by the rising sun ; and when the sun declined she rested not . “
46907	46996	46889	46891	the angry goddess	2147	“ His face grew spotted where the mixture struck , and legs appeared where he had arms before , a tail was added to his changing trunk ; and lest his former strength might cause great harm , all parts contracted till he measured less than common lizards . While the ancient dame wondered and wept and strove for one caress , the reptile fled and sought a lurking place . — His very name describes him to the eye , a body starred with many coloured spots . “
47195	47308	47167	47167	she	4979	“ For that she broke with savage hand the plows , which there had turned the soil , and full of wrath leveled in equal death the peasant and his ox — both tillers of the soil — and made decree that land should prove deceptive to the seed , and rot all planted germs . — That fertile isle , so noted through the world , becomes a waste ; the corn is blighted in the early blade ; excessive heat , excessive rain destroys ; the winds destroy , the constellations harm ; the greedy birds devour the scattered seeds ; thistles and tares and tough weeds choke the wheat . “
47604	47952	47586	47586	She	764	“ Astonished and amazed , as thunderstruck , when Proserpina 's mother heard these words , long while she stood till great bewilderment gave way to heavy grief . Then to the skies , ethereal , she mounted in her car and with beclouded face and streaming hair stood fronting Jove , opprobrious . ‘ I have come O Jupiter , a suppliant to thee , both for my own offspring as well as thine . If thy hard heart deny a mother grace , yet haply as a father thou canst feel some pity for thy daughter ; and I pray thy care for her may not be valued less because my groaning travail brought her forth . — My long - sought daughter has at last been found , if one can call it , found , when certain loss more certain has been proved ; or so may deem the knowledge of her state . — But I may bear his rude ways , if again he bring her back . ‘ Thy worthy child should not be forced to we d a bandit - chief , nor should my daughter 's charms reward his crime . ’ She spoke ; — and Jupiter took up the word ; ‘ This daughter is a care , a sacred pledge to me as well as thee ; but if it please us to acknowledge truth , this is a deed of love and injures not . And if , O goddess , thou wilt not oppose , such law - son can not compass our disgrace : for though all else were wanting , naught can need Jove 's brother , who in fortune yields to none save me . But if thy fixed desire compel dissent , let Proserpine return to Heaven ; however , subject to the binding law , if there her tongue have never tasted food — a sure condition , by the Fates decreed . ’ he spoke ; but Ceres was no less resolved to lead her daughter thence . “
48144	48287	48124	48124	he	772	“ The telltale 's punishment was only just ; O Siren Maids , but wherefore thus have ye the feet and plumes of birds , although remain your virgin features ? Is it from the day when Proserpina gathered vernal flowers ; because ye mingled with her chosen friends ? And after she was lost , in vain ye sought through all the world ; and wished for wings to waft you over the great deep , that soon the sea might feel your great concern . — The Gods were kind : ye saw your limbs grow yellow , with a growth of sudden - sprouting feathers ; but because your melodies that gently charm the ear , besides the glory of your speech , might lose the blessing , of a tongue , your virgin face and human voice remained . “
48398	49374	49385	49387	the fertile goddess	2198	“ And genial Ceres , full of joy , that now her daughter was regained , began to speak ; ‘ Declare the reason of thy wanderings , O Arethusa ! tell me wherefore thou wert made a sacred stream . ’ The waters gave no sound ; but soon that goddess raised her head from the deep springs ; and after sue had dried her green hair with her hand , with fair address she told the ancient amours of that stream which flows through Elis . — ‘ I was one among the Nymphs of old Achaia , ’ — so she said — ‘ And none of them more eager sped than I , along the tangled pathways ; and I fixed the hunting - nets with zealous care . — Although I strove not for the praise that beauty gives , and though my form was something stout for grace , it had the name of being beautiful . ‘ So worthless seemed the praise , I took no joy in my appearance — as a country lass I blushed at those endowments which would give delight to others — even the power to please seemed criminal . — And I remember when returning weary from Stymphal fan woods , and hot with toil , that made the glowing sun seem twice as hot , I chanced upon a stream , that flowed without a ripple or a sound so smoothly on , I hardly thought it moved . ‘ The water was so clear that one could see and count the pebbles in the deepest parts , and silver willows and tall poplar trees , nourished by flowing waters , spread their shade over the shelving banks . So I approached , and shrinkingly touched the cool stream with my feet ; and then I ventured deeper to my knees ; and not contented doffed my fleecy robes , and laid them on a bending willow tree . Then , naked , I plunged deeply in the stream , and while I smote the water with my hands , and drew it towards me , striking boldly forth , moving my body in a thousand ways , I thought I heard a most unusual sound , a murmuring noise beneath the middle stream . ‘ Alarmed , I hastened to the nearest bank , and as I stood upon its edge , these words hoarsely Alpheus uttered from his waves ; ‘ Oh , whither dost thou hasten ? ’ and again , ‘ Oh , whither dost thou hasten ? ’ said the voice . ‘ Just as I was , I fled without my clothes , for I had left them on the other bank ; which , when he saw , so much the more inflamed , more swiftly he pursued : my nakedness was tempting to his gaze . And thus I ran ; and thus relentlessly he pressed my steps : so from the hawk the dove with trembling wings ; and so , the hawk pursues the frightened dove . ‘ Swiftly and long I fled , with winding course , to Orchamenus , Psophis and Cyllene , and Maenalus and Erymanthus cold , and Elis . Neither could he gain by speed , although his greater strength must soon prevail , for I not longer could endure the strain . ‘ Still I sped onward through the fields and woods , by tangled wilds and over rocks and crags ; and as I hastened from the setting sun , I thought I saw a growing shadow move beyond my feet ; it may have been my fear imagined it , but surely now I heard the sound of footsteps : I could even feel his breathing on the loose ends of my hair ; and I was terrified . At last , worn out by all my efforts to escape , I cried ; ‘ Oh , help me — thou whose bow and quivered darts I oft have borne — thy armour - bearer calls — O chaste Diana help , — or I am lost . ’ ‘ It moved the goddess , and she gathered up a dense cloud , and encompassed me about . — The baffled River circled round and round , seeking to find me , hidden in that cloud — twice went the River round , and twice cried out , ‘ Ho , Arethusa ! Arethusa , Ho ! ’ ‘ What were my wretched feelings then ? Could I be braver than the Iamb that hears the wolves , howling around the high - protecting fold ? Or than the hare , which lurking in the bush knows of the snarling hounds and dares not move ? And yet , Alpheus thence would not depart , for he could find no footprints of my flight . ‘ He watched the cloud and spot , and thus besieged , a cold sweat gathered on my trembling limbs . The clear - blue drops , distilled from every pore , made pools of water where I moved my feet , and dripping moisture trickled from my hair . — Much quicker than my story could be told , my body was dissolved to flowing streams . — But still the River recognized the waves , and for the love of me transformed his shape from human features to his proper streams , that so his waters might encompass mine . ‘ Diana , therefore , opened up the ground , in which I plunged , and thence through gloomy caves was carried to Ortygia — blessed isle ! To which my chosen goddess gave her name ! Where first I rose amid the upper air ! ’ “
49462	49534	49542	49542	he	2206	“ After he had traveled through uncharted skies , over wide Europe and vast Asian lands , he lit upon the coast of Scythia , where a king called Lyncus reigned . And there , at once he sought the palace of that king , who said ; ‘ Whence come you , stranger , wherefore in this land ? Come , tell to me your nation and your name . ’ “
49609	49683	49684	49688	The greatest of our number	2213	“ The envious Lyncus , wishing to appear the gracious author of all benefits , received the unsuspecting youth with smiles ; but when he fell into a heavy sleep that savage king attacked him with a sword — but while attempting to transfix his guest , the goddess Ceres changed him to a lynx : — and once again she sent her favoured youth to drive her sacred dragons through the clouds . “
49717	49787	49699	49701	the chosen Nymphs	2093	“ But the vanquished nine began to scatter their abuse ; to whom rejoined the goddess ; ‘ Since it seems a trifling thing that you should suffer a deserved defeat , and you must add unmerited abuse to heighten your offence , and since by this appears the end of our endurance , we shall certainly proceed to punish you according to the limit of our wrath . ’ “
49915	49937	49951	49951	they	2219	” All this Minerva heard ; and she approved their songs and their resentment ; but her heart was brooding thus , “
49973	50224	50226	50226	her	2226	” — So her thought was turned upon the fortune of Arachne — proud , who would not ever yield to her the praise won by the art of deftly weaving wool , a girl who had not fame for place of birth , nor fame for birth , but only fame for skill ! For it was well known that her father dwelt in Colophon ; where , at his humble trade , he dyed in Phocean purples , fleecy wool . Her mother , also of the lower class , had died . Arachne in a mountain town by skill had grown so famous in the Land of Lydia , that unnumbered curious nymphs eager to witness her dexterity , deserted the lush vineyards of Timolus ; or even left the cool and flowing streams of bright Pactolus , to admire the cloth , or to observe her deftly spinning wool . So graceful was her motion then , — if she was twisting the coarse wool in little balls , or if she teased it with her finger - tips , or if she softened the fine fleece , drawn forth in misty films , or if she twirled the smooth round spindle with her energetic thumb , or if with needle she embroidered cloth ; — in all her motions one might well perceive how much Minerva had instructed her : but this she ever would deny , displeased to share her fame ; and said , “
50245	50285	50226	50226	her	2226	” Minerva heard , and came to her , disguised with long grey hair , and with a staff to steady her weak limbs . She seemed a feeble woman , very old , and quavered as she said , “
50366	50409	50410	50411	Silly fool	2229	” Arachne , scowling with an evil face . Looked at the goddess , as she dropped her thread . She hardly could restrain her threatening hand , and , trembling in her anger , she replied to you , disguised Minerva : “
50503	50510	50511	50511	Minerva	543	” Instantly , the goddess said , “
50516	51846	50511	50511	Minerva	543	” And with those brief words , put aside the shape of the old woman , and revealed herself , Minerva , goddess . All the other Nymphs and matrons of Mygdonia worshiped her ; but not Arachne , who defiant stood ; — although at first she flushed up — then went pale — then blushed again , reluctant . — So , at first , the sky suffuses , as Aurora moves , and , quickly when the glorious sun comes up , pales into white . She even rushed upon her own destruction , for she would not give from her desire to gain the victory . Nor did the daughter of almighty Jove decline : disdaining to delay with words , she hesitated not . And both , at once , selected their positions , stretched their webs with finest warp , and separated warp with sley . The woof was next inserted in the web by means of the sharp shuttles , which their nimble fingers pushed along , so drawn within the warp , and so the teeth notched in the moving sley might strike them . — Both , in haste , girded their garments to their breasts and moved their skilful arms , beguiling their fatigue in eager action . Myriad tints appeared besides the Tyrian purple — royal dye , extracted in brass vessels . — As the bow , that spans new glory in the curving sky , its glittering rays reflected in the rain , spreads out a multitude of blended tints , in scintillating beauty to the sight of all who gaze upon it ; — so the threads , inwoven , mingled in a thousand tints , harmonious and contrasting ; shot with gold : and there , depicted in those shining webs , were shown the histories of ancient days : — Minerva worked the Athenian Hill of Mars , where ancient Cecrops built his citadel , and showed the old contention for the name it should be given . — Twelve celestial Gods surrounded Jupiter , on lofty thrones ; and all their features were so nicely drawn , that each could be distinguished . — Jupiter appeared as monarch of those judging Gods . There Neptune , guardian of the sea , was shown contending with Minerva . As he struck the Rock with his long trident , a wild horse sprang forth which he bequeathed to man . He claimed his right to name the city for that gift . And then she wove a portrait of herself , bearing a shield , and in her hand a lance , sharp - pointed , and a helmet on her head — her breast well - guarded by her Aegis : there she struck her spear into the fertile earth , from which a branch of olive seemed to sprout , pale with new clustered fruits . — And those twelve Gods , appeared to judge , that olive as a gift surpassed the horse which Neptune gave to man . And , so Arachne , rival of her fame , might learn the folly of her mad attempt , from the great deeds of ancient histories , and what award presumption must expect , Minerva wove four corners with life scenes of contest , brightly colored , but of size diminutive . In one of these was shown the snow - clad mountains , Rhodope , and Haemus , which for punishment were changed from human beings to those rigid forms , when they aspired to rival the high Gods . And in another corner she described that Pygmy , whom the angry Juno changed from queen - ship to a crane ; because she thought herself an equal of the living Gods , she was commanded to wage cruel wars upon her former subjects . In the third , she wove the story of Antigone , who dared compare herself to Juno , queen of Jupiter , and showed her as she was transformed into a silly chattering stork , that praised her beauty , with her ugly beak . — Despite the powers of Ilion and her sire Laomedon , her shoulders fledged white wings . And so , the third part finished , there was left one corner , where Minerva deftly worked the story of the father , Cinyras ; — as he was weeping on the temple steps , which once had been his daughter 's living limbs . And she adorned the border with designs of peaceful olive — her devoted tree — which having shown , she made an end of work . Arachne , of Maeonia , wove , at first the story of Europa , as the bull deceived her , and so perfect was her art , it seemed a real bull in real waves . Europa seemed to look back towards the land which she had left ; and call in her alarm to her companions — and as if she feared the touch of dashing waters , to draw up her timid feet , while she was sitting on the bull 's back . And she wove Asteria seized by the assaulting eagle ; and beneath the swan 's white wings showed Leda lying by the stream : and showed Jove dancing as a Satyr , when he sought the beautiful Antiope , to whom was given twins ; and how he seemed Amphitryon when he deceived Alcmena ; and how he courted lovely Danae luring her as a gleaming shower of gold ; and poor Aegina , hidden in his flame , jove as a shepherd with Mnemosyne ; and beautiful Proserpina , involved by him , apparent as a spotted snake . And in her web , Arachne wove the scenes of Neptune : — who was shown first as a bull , when he was deep in love with virgin Arne then as Enipeus when the giant twins , Aloidae , were begot ; and as the ram that gambolled with Bisaltis ; as a horse loved by the fruitful Ceres , golden haired , all - bounteous mother of the yellow grain ; and as the bird that hovered round snake - haired Medusa , mother of the winged horse ; and as the dolphin , sporting with the Nymph , Melantho . — All of these were woven true to life , in proper shades . And there she showed Apollo , when disguised in various forms : as when he seemed a rustic ; and as when he wore hawk - wings , and then the tawny skin of a great lion ; and once more when he deluded Isse , as a shepherd lad . And there was Bacchus , when he was disguised as a large cluster of fictitious grapes ; deluding by that wile the beautiful Erigone ; — and Saturn , as a steed , begetter of the dual - natured Chiron . And then Arachne , to complete her work , wove all around the web a patterned edge of interlacing flowers and ivy leaves . Minerva could not find a fleck or flaw — even Envy can not censure perfect art — enraged because Arachne had such skill she ripped the web , and ruined all the scenes that showed those wicked actions of the Gods ; and with her boxwood shuttle in her hand , struck the unhappy mortal on her head , — struck sharply thrice , and even once again . Arachne 's spirit , deigning not to brook such insult , brooded on it , till she tied a cord around her neck , and hung herself . Minerva , moved to pity at the sight , sustained and saved her from that bitter death ; but , angry still , pronounced another doom : “
51883	52165	52166	52166	You	2238	” Even as she spoke , before withdrawing from her victim 's sight , she sprinkled her with juice — extract of herbs of Hecate . At once all hair fell off , her nose and ears remained not , and her head shrunk rapidly in size , as well as all her body , leaving her diminutive . — Her slender fingers gathered to her sides as long thin legs ; and all her other parts were fast absorbed in her abdomen — whence she vented a fine thread ; — and ever since , Arachne , as a spider , weaves her web . All Lydia was astonished at her fate the Rumor spread to Phrygia , soon the world was filled with fear and wonder . Niobe had known her long before , — when in Maeonia near to Mount Sipylus ; but the sad fate which overtook Arachne , lost on her , she never ceased her boasting and refused to honor the great Gods . So many things increased her pride : She loved to boast her husband 's skill , their noble family , the rising grandeur of their kingdom . Such felicities were great delights to her ; but nothing could exceed the haughty way she boasted of her children : and , in truth , Niobe might have been adjudged on earth , the happiest mother of mankind , if pride had not destroyed her wit . It happened then , that Manto , daughter of Tiresias , who told the future ; when she felt the fire of prophecy descend upon her , rushed upon the street and shouted in the midst : “
52220	52326	52213	52213	Latona	798	” At once , the Theban women wreathe their brows with laurel , and they cast in hallowed flame the grateful incense , while they supplicate all favors of the ever - living Gods . And while they worship , Niobe comes there , surrounded with a troup that follow her , and most conspicuous in her purple robe , bright with inwoven threads of yellow gold . Beautiful in her anger , she tosses back her graceful head . The glory of her hair shines on her shoulders . Standing forth , she looks upon them with her haughty eyes , and taunts them , “
52393	52523	52533	52534	a goddess	5320	“ Tantalus was my father , who alone approached the tables of the Gods in heaven ; my mother , sister of the Pleiades , was daughter of huge Atlas , who supports the world upon his shoulders ; I can boast of Jupiter as father of my sire , I count him also as my father - in - law . The peoples of my Phrygia dread my power , and I am mistress of the palace built by Cadmus . By my husband , I am queen of those great walls that reared themselves to the sweet music of his sounding lyre . We rule together all the people they encompass and defend . And everywhere my gaze is turned , an evidence of wealth is witnessed . “
52577	52683	52686	52686	she	2250	“ All must acknowledge my just cause of pride and must no longer worship , in despite of my superior birth , this deity , a daughter of ignoble Coeus , whom one time the great Earth would not even grant sufficient space for travail : whom the Heavens , the Land , the Sea together once compelled to wander , hopeless on all hostile shores ! Throughout the world she found herself rebuffed , till Delos , sorry for the vagrant , said , ‘ Homeless you roam the lands , and I the seas ! ’ And even her refuge always was adrift . “
52723	52825	52826	52826	They	2254	“ The wealth of my abundance is too strong for Fortune to assail me . Let her rage despoil me of large substance ; yet so much would still be mine , for I have risen above the blight of apprehension . But , suppose a few of my fair children should be taken ! Even so deprived , I could not be reduced to only two , as this Latona , who , might quite as well be childless . — Get you gone from this insensate sacrifice . Make haste ! Cast off the wreathing laurels from your brows ! ”
52885	53007	52861	52861	she	798	“ Behold your mother , proud of having borne such glorious children ! I will yield prestige before no goddess — save alone immortal Juno ! I have been debased , and driven for all ages from my own — my altars , unto me devoted long , and so must languish through eternity , unless by you sustained . Nor is this all ; . That daughter of Tantalus , bold Niobe , has added curses to her evil deeds , and with a tongue as wicked as her sire 's , has raised her base - born children over mine . Has even called me childless ! A sad fate more surely should be hers ! Oh , I entreat ”
53014	53034	53010	53010	Phoebus	549	“ No more complaint is necessary , for it only serves to hinder the swift sequel of her doom . ”
53150	53155	53129	53129	Ismenus	523	“ Ah wretched me ! ”
53585	53599	53576	53576	his	806	“ O Universal Deities , gods of eternal heaven , spare my life ! ”
53818	53911	53915	53915	she	2284	“ Glut your revenge ! Latona , glut your rage ! Yea , let my lamentations be your joy ! Go — satiate your flinty heart with death ! Are not my seven sons all dead ? Am I not waiting to be carried to my grave ? — exult and triumph , my victorious foe ! Victorious ? Nay ! — Much more remains to me in all my utmost sorrow , than to you , you gloater upon vengeance — Undismayed , I stand victorious in my Field of Woe ! ”
54139	54163	54126	54126	she	5344	“ Oh , leave me this one child ! the youngest of them all ! My darling daughter — only leave me one ! ”
54582	54595	54564	54565	my guide	2319	“ Be propitious , hear my supplications , and forget not me ! ”
54606	54611	54597	54597	I	0	“ Forget not me ! ”
54624	54649	54617	54617	I	0	“ Whose altar can this be ? Perhaps a sacred altar of the Fauns , or of the Naiads , or a native God ? ”
54656	54894	54617	54617	I	0	“ Young man , such Gods may not be worshiped at this altar . She whom once the royal Juno drove away to wander a harsh world , alone permits this altar to be used : that goddess whom the wandering Isle of Delos , at the time it drifted as the foam , almost refused a refuge . There Latona , as she leaned against a palm - tree — and against the tree most sacred to Minerva , brought forth twins , although their harsh step - mother , Juno , strove to interfere . — And from the island forced to fly by jealous Juno , on her breast she bore her children , twin Divinities . At last , outwearied with the toil , and parched with thirst — long - wandering in those heated days over the arid land of Lycia , where was bred the dire Chimaera — at the time her parching breasts were drained , she saw this pool of crystal water , shimmering in the vale . Some countrymen were there to gather reeds , and useful osiers , and the bulrush , found with sedge in fenny pools . To them approached Latona , and she knelt upon the merge to cool her thirst , with some refreshing water . But those clowns forbade her and the goddess cried , as they so wickedly opposed her need : “
55047	55194	55027	55029	these tender infants	2328	” And just as she spoke , it chanced the children did stretch out their arms and who would not be touched to hear such words , as spoken by this goddess , and refuse ? But still those clowns persisted in their wrong against the goddess ; for they hindered her , and threatened with their foul , abusive tongues to frighten her away — and , worse than all , they even muddied with their hands and feet the clear pool ; forcing the vile , slimy dregs up from the bottom , in a spiteful way , by jumping up and down . — Enraged at this , she felt no further thirst , nor would she deign to supplicate again ; but , feeling all the outraged majesty of her high state , she raised her hands to Heaven , and exclaimed , “
55205	55465	55474	55474	you	2331	” The curse as soon as uttered took effect , and every one of them began to swim beneath the water , and to leap and plunge deep in the pool . — Now , up they raise their heads , now swim upon the surface , now they squat themselves around the marshy margent , now they plump again down to the chilly deeps . And , ever and again , with croaking throats , indulge offensive strife upon the banks , or even under water , boom abuse . Their ugly voices cause their bloated necks to puff out ; and their widened jaws are made still wider in the venting of their spleen . Their backs , so closely fastened to their heads , make them appear as if their shrunken necks have been cut off . Their backbones are dark green ; white are their bellies , now their largest part . — Forever since that time , the foolish frogs muddy their own pools , where they leap and dive . So he related how the clowns were changed to leaping frogs ; and after he was through , another told the tale of Marsyas , in these words : The Satyr Marsyas , when he played the flute in rivalry against Apollo 's lyre , lost that audacious contest and , alas ! His life was forfeit ; for , they had agreed the one who lost should be the victor 's prey . And , as Apollo punished him , he cried , “
55490	55674	55474	55474	you	2331	” Even as he shrieked out in his agony , his living skin was ripped off from his limbs , till his whole body was a flaming wound , with nerves and veins and viscera exposed . But all the weeping people of that land , and all the Fauns and Sylvan Deities , and all the Satyrs , and Olympus , his loved pupil — even then renowned in song , and all the Nymphs , lamented his sad fate ; and all the shepherds , roaming on the hills , lamented as they tended fleecy flocks . And all those falling tears , on fruitful Earth , descended to her deepest veins , as drip the moistening dews , — and , gathering as a fount , turned upward from her secret - winding caves , to issue , sparkling , in the sun - kissed air , the clearest river in the land of Phrygia , — through which it swiftly flows between steep banks down to the sea : and , therefore , from his name , ' Tis called “
55677	56228	56229	56229	My	0	” to this very day . And after this was told , the people turned and wept for Niobe 's loved children dead , and also , mourned Amphion , sorrow - slain . The Theban people hated Niobe , but Pelops , her own brother , mourned her death ; and as he rent his garment , and laid bare his white left shoulder , you could see the part composed of ivory . — At his birth ' twas all of healthy flesh ; but when his father cut his limbs asunder , and the Gods restored his life , all parts were rightly joined , except part of one shoulder , which was wanting ; so to serve the purpose of the missing flesh , a piece of ivory was inserted there , making his body by such means complete . The lords of many cities that were near , now met together and implored their kings to mourn with Pelops those unhappy deeds . — The lords of Argos ; Sparta and Mycenae ; and Calydon , before it had incurred the hatred of Diana , goddess of the chase ; fertile Orchomenus and Corinth , great in wealth of brass ; Patrae and fierce Messena ; Cleone , small ; and Pylus and Troezen , not ruled by Pittheus then , — and also , all the other cities which are shut off by the Isthmus there dividing by its two seas , and all the cities which are seen from there . What seemed most wonderful , of all those towns Athens alone was wanting , for a war had gathered from the distant seas , a host of savage warriors had alarmed her walls , and hindered her from mourning for the dead . Now Tereus , then the mighty king of Thrace , came to the aid of Athens as defense from that fierce horde ; and there by his great deeds achieved a glorious fame . Since his descent was boasted from the mighty Gradivus , and he was gifted with enormous wealth , Pandion , king of Athens , gave to him in sacred wedlock his dear daughter , Procne . But Juno , guardian of the sacred rites attended not , nor Hymenaeus , nor the Graces . But the Furies snatched up brands from burning funeral pyres , and brandished them as torches . They prepared the nuptial couch , — a boding owl flew over the bride 's room , and then sat silently upon the roof . With such bad omens Tereus married her , sad Procne , and those omens cast a gloom on all the household till the fateful birth of their first born . All Thrace went wild with joy — and even they , rejoicing , blessed the Gods , when he , the little Itys , saw the light ; and they ordained each year their wedding day , and every year the birthday of their child , should be observed with festival and song : so the sad veil of fate conceals from us our future woes . Now Titan had drawn forth the changing seasons through five autumns , when , in gentle accents , Procne spoke these words : “
56283	57002	56280	56281	the Gods	1395	” At once the monarch ordered his long ships to launch upon the sea ; and driven by sail , and hastened by the swiftly sweeping oars , they entered the deep port of Athens , where he made fair landing on the fortified Piraeus . There , when time was opportune to greet his father - in - law and shake his hand , they both exchanged their wishes for good health , and Tereus told the reason why he came . He was relating all his wife 's desire . Promising Philomela 's safe return from a brief visit , when Philomela appeared rich in her costly raiment , yet more rich in charm and beauty , just as if a fair Dryad or Naiad should be so attired , appearing radiant , from dark solitudes . As if someone should kindle whitening corn or the dry leaves , or hay piled in a stack ; so Tereus , when he saw the beautiful and blushing virgin , was consumed with love . Her modest beauty was a worthy cause of worthy love ; but by his heritage , derived from a debasing clime , his love was base ; and fires unholy burned within from his own lawless nature , just as fierce as are the habits of his evil race . In the wild frenzy of his wicked heart , he thought he would corrupt her trusted maid , her tried attendants , and corrupt even her virtue with large presents : he would waste his kingdom in the effort . — He prepared to seize her at the risk of cruel war . And he would do or dare all things to feed his raging flame . — He could not brook delay . With most impassioned words he begged for her , pretending he gave voice to Procne 's hopes . — his own desire made him wax eloquent , as often as his words exceeded bounds , he pleaded he was uttering Procne 's words . His hypocritic eyes were filled with tears , as though they represented her desire — and , O you Gods above , what devious ways are harbored in the hearts of mortals ! Through his villainous desire he gathered praise , and many lauded him for the great love he bore his wife . And even Philomela desires her own undoing ; and with fond embraces nestles to her father , while she pleads for his consent , that she may go to visit her dear sister . — Tereus viewed her pretty pleading , and in his hot heart , imagined he was then embracing her ; and as he saw her kiss her father 's lips , her arms around his neck , it seemed that each caress was his ; and so his fire increased . He even wished he were her father ; though , if it were so , his passion would no less be impious . — Overcome at last by these entreaties , her kind father gave consent . Greatly she joyed and thanked him for her own misfortune . She imagined a success , instead of all the sorrow that would come . The day declining , little of his toil remained for Phoebus . Now his flaming steeds were beating with their hoofs the downward slope of high Olympus ; and the regal feast was set before the guests , and flashing wine was poured in golden vessels , and the feast went merrily , until the satisfied assembly sought in gentle sleep their rest . Not so , the love - hot Tereus , king of Thrace , who , sleepless , imaged in his doting mind the form of Philomela , recalled the shape of her fair hands , and in his memory reviewed her movements . And his flaming heart pictured her beauties yet unseen . — He fed his frenzy on itself , and could not sleep . Fair broke the day ; and now the ancient king , Pandion , took his son - in - law 's right hand to bid farewell ; and , as he wept , commended his dear daughter , Philomela , unto his guarding care . “
57112	57159	57160	57162	The old king	2342	“ And , O my dearest daughter , Philomela , if you have any love for me , return without too long delay and comfort me , lest I may grieve ; for it is quite enough that I should suffer while your sister stays away . ”
57299	57320	57291	57291	Tereus	815	“ Now all is well , the object of my love sails with me while the sailors ply the oars . ”
57619	57703	57610	57610	her	2364	“ Oh , barbarous and brutal wretch ! Unnatural monster of abhorrent deeds ! Could not my anxious father 's parting words , nor his foreboding tears restrain your lust ? Have you no slight regard for your chaste wife , my dearest sister , and are you without all honor , so to spoil virginity now making me invade my sister 's claim , you have befouled the sacred fount of life , — you are a lawless bond of double sin ! “
57801	57873	57874	57874	Her	2366	“ I shall declare your sin before the world , and publish my own shame to punish you ! And if I 'm prisoned in the solitudes , my voice will wake the echoes in the wood and move the conscious rocks . Hear me , O Heaven ! And let my imprecations rouse the Gods — ah - h - h , if there can be a god in Heaven ! ”
58573	58582	58569	58569	she	2366	“ Ee - woh - ee - e ! ”
58773	58825	58755	58755	Procne	817	“ This is no time for weeping ! awful deeds demand a great revenge — take up the sword , and any weapon fiercer than its edge ! My breast is hardened to the worst of crime make haste with me ! together let us put this palace to the torch ! “
58896	58934	58974	58974	mother	5115	” While Procne still was raving out such words , Itys , her son , was hastening to his mother ; and when she saw him , her revengeful eyes conceiving a dark punishment , she said , “
58945	58973	58974	58974	mother	5115	” She gave no other warning , but prepared to execute a horrible revenge . But when the tender child came up to her , and called her “
58975	59076	59100	59100	She	2400	” , put his little arms around her neck , and when he smiled and kissed her often , gracious in his cunning ways , — again the instinct of true motherhood pulsed in her veins , and moved to pity , she began to weep in spite of her resolve . Feeling the tender impulse of her love unnerving her , she turned her eyes from him and looked upon her sister , and from her glanced at her darling boy again . And so , while she was looking at them both , by turns , she said , “
59147	59229	59232	59232	mother	5115	” No more she hesitated , but as swift as the fierce tigress of the Ganges leaps , seizes the suckling offspring of the hind , and drags it through the forest to its lair ; so , Procne seized and dragged the frightened boy to a most lonely section of the house ; and there she put him to the cruel sword , while he , aware of his sad fate , stretched forth his little hands , and cried , “
59238	59445	59232	59232	mother	5115	” And clung to her — clung to her , while she struck — her fixed eyes , maddened , glaring horribly — struck wildly , lopping off his tender limbs . But Philomela cut through his tender throat . Then they together , mangled his remains , still quivering with the remnant of his life , and boiled a part of him in steaming pots , that bubbled over with the dead child 's blood , and roasted other parts on hissing spits . And , after all was ready , Procne bade her husband , Tereus , to the loathsome feast , and with a false pretense of sacred rites , according to the custom of her land , by which , but one man may partake of it , she sent the servants from the banquet hall . — Tereus , majestic on his ancient throne high in imagined state , devoured his son , and gorged himself with flesh of his own flesh — and in his rage of gluttony called out for Itys to attend and share the feast ! Curst with a joy she could conceal no more , and eager to gloat over his distress , Procne cried out , “
59459	59896	59232	59232	mother	5115	” — Amazed , he looked around and called his son again : — that instant , Philomela sprang forth — her hair disordered , and all stained with blood of murder , unable then to speak , she hurled the head of Itys in his father 's fear - struck face , and more than ever longed for fitting words . The Thracian Tereus overturned the table , and howling , called up from the Stygian pit , the viperous sisters . Tearing at his breast , in miserable efforts to disgorge the half - digested gobbets of his son , he called himself his own child 's sepulchre , and wept the hot tears of a frenzied man . Then with his sword he rushed at the two sisters . Fleeing from him , they seemed to rise on wings , and it was true , for they had changed to birds . Then Philomela , flitting to the woods , found refuge in the leaves : but Procne flew straight to the sheltering gables of a roof — and always , if you look , you can observe the brand of murder on the swallow 's breast — red feathers from that day . And Tereus , swift in his great agitation , and his will to wreak a fierce revenge , himself is turned into a crested bird . His long , sharp beak is given him instead of a long sword , and so , because his beak is long and sharp , he rightly bears the name of Hoopoe . Before the number of his years was told , Pandion with the shades of Tartarus , because of this , has wandered in sad dooms . Erectheus , next in line , with mighty sway and justice , ruled all Athens on the throne left vacant by the good Pandion 's death . Four daughters and four sons were granted him ; and of his daughters , two were beautiful , and one of these was we d to Cephalus , grandson of Aeolus . — But mighty Boreas desired the hand of Orithyia , fair and lovable . — King Tereus and the Thracians were then such obstacles to Boreas the god was long kept from his dear beloved . Although the great king ( who compels the cold north - wind ) had sought with prayers to win her hand , and urged his love in gentleness , not force . When quite aware his wishes were disdained , he roughly said , with customary rage and violence : “
59958	60037	59950	59950	I	0	“ Tremendous actions are the wine of life ! — monarch of Violence , rolling on clouds , I toss wide waters , and I fell huge trees — knotted old oaks — and whirled upon ice - wings , I scatter the light snow , and pelt the Earth with sleet and hail ! I rush through boundless voids . My thunders rumble in the hollow clouds — and crash upon my brothers — fire to fire ! “
60084	60113	60117	60117	Boreas	460	“ Such are the fateful powers I should use , and never trust entreaties to prevail , or win my bride — Force is the law of life ! ”
60573	60680	60570	60570	she	835	“ In vain I 've striven to subdue my heart : some god it must be , which I can not tell , is working to destroy my hapless life ; or else it is the burning flame of love that in me rages . If it is not love , why do the mandates of my father seem too harsh ? They surely are too harsh . Why do I fear that he may perish whom I have seen only once ? What is the secret cause that I am agitated by such fears ? — It is no other than the god of Love . “
60747	60796	60810	60812	the living Gods	1912	“ O royal maiden , why are you consumed with love for this strange man , and why are you so willing to be carried by the nuptial ties so far from your own country , where , indeed , are many brave men worthy of your love ? “
60870	60936	60853	60853	His	833	“ Have I a heart of flint , or was I born a tigress to deny him timely aid ? — Unless I interpose , he will be slain by the hot breath of brazen - footed bulls , or will be slaughtered by the warriors , sprung miraculous from earth , or will be given to satisfy the ravenous appetite of a huge dragon . “
60981	60987	60995	60996	the Gods	456	“ Avert it Gods ! — “
61021	61089	61096	61096	his	2443	“ Such a course would wreck the kingdom of my father — and by me the wily stranger would escape from him ; and spreading to the wind his ready sails he would forget and leave me to my fate . — Oh , if he should forget my sacrifice , and so prefer those who neglected him , let him then perish in his treachery . — “
61195	61265	61266	61266	I	0	“ Shall I then sail away , and so forsake my sister , brother , father , Gods , and land that gave me birth ? My father is indeed a stern man , and my native land is all too barbarous ; my brother is a child , — my sister 's goodwill is good help for me ; and heaven 's supreme god is within my breast . “
61368	61432	61440	61440	I	0	“ Should I hesitate because the wreck - strewn mountains bar the way , and clash together in the Euxine waves ; or fear Charybdis , fatal to large ships , that sucks the deep sea in its whirling gulf and spouts far upward , with alternate force , or Scylla , circled with infuriate hounds howling in rage from deep Sicilian waves ? “
61488	61533	61536	61536	she	2463	“ Alas , Medea , this vain argument has only furnished plausible excuse for criminal desires , and desecrates the marriage rite . It is a wicked thing to think upon . Before it is too late forget your passion and deny this guilt . ”
61789	61827	61779	61779	she	2464	“ I see what I will do , and ignorance of truth will not be my undoing now , but love itself . By my assistance you shall be preserved ; but when preserved fulfill your promise . ”
62804	62872	62876	62876	he	833	“ Dearest , to whom my life and love are due , although your kindness has been great to me , and you have granted more than I should ask , yet one thing more I beg of you ; if your enchantments can accomplish my desire , take from my life some years that I should live and add them to my father 's ending days . ”
62909	63016	62905	62905	she	835	“ A wicked thing you ask ! Can I be capable of using you in such a manner as to take your life and give it to another ? Ask not me a thing so dreadful ! May the Gods forbid ! — I will endeavor to perform for you a task much greater . By the powers of Night I will most certainly return to him the lost years of your father , but must not deprive you of your own . — Oh grant the power , great goddess of the triple form , that I may fail not to accomplish this great deed ! ”
63179	63266	63158	63158	she	835	“ O faithful Night , regard my mysteries ! O golden - lighted Stars ! O softly - moving Moon — genial , your fire succeeds the heated day ! O Hecate ! grave three - faced queen of these charms of enchanters and enchanters , arts ! O fruitful Earth , giver of potent herbs ! O gentle Breezes and destructive Winds ! You Mountains , Rivers , Lakes and sacred Groves , and every dreaded god of silent Night ! Attend upon me ! — “
63436	63529	63416	63416	I	0	“ At my command you tamed the flaming bulls which long disdained to bend beneath the yoke , until they pressed their necks against the plows ; and , subject to my will , you raised up war till the strong company of dragon - birth were slaughtered as they fought amongst themselves ; and , last , you lulled asleep the warden 's eyes — guards of the Golden Fleece — till then awake and sleeping never — so , deceiving him , you sent the treasure to the Grecian cities ! “
63594	64838	63555	63555	You	2525	” A chariot , sent from heaven , came to her — and soon as she had stroked the dragons ' necks , and shaken in her hands the guiding reins — as soon as she had mounted , she was borne quickly above , through unresisting air . And , sailing over Thessaly , she saw the vale of Tempe , where the level soil is widely covered with a crumbling chalk — she turned her dragons towards new regions there : and she observed the herbs by Ossa born , the weeds on lofty Pelion , Othrys , Pindus and vast Olympus — and from here she plucked the needed roots , or there , the blossoms clipped all with a moon - curved sickle made of brass — many the wild weeds by Apidanus , as well as blue Amphrysus ' banks , she chose , and not escaped Enipeus from her search ; Peneian stretches and Spercheian banks all yielded what she chose : — and Boebe 's shore where sway the rushes ; and she plucked up grass , a secret grass , from fair Euboean fields life - giving virtues in their waving blades , as yet unknown for transformation wrought on Glaucus . All those fields she visited , with ceaseless diligence in quest of charms , nine days and nine nights sought strong herbs , and the swift dragons with their active wings , failed not to guide the chariot where she willed — until they reached her home . The dragons then had not been even touched by anything , except the odor of surrounding herbs , and yet they sloughed their skins , the growth of years . She would not cross the threshold of her home nor pass its gates ; but , standing in the field , alone beneath the canopy of Heaven , she shunned all contact with her husband , while she built up from the ever - living turf two altars , one of which upon the right to Hecate was given , but the one upon the left was sacred then to you , O Hebe , goddess of eternal youth ! Festooning woodland boughs and sweet vervain adorned these altars , near by which she dug as many trenches . Then , when all was done , she slaughtered a black ram , and sprinkled with blood the thirsty trenches ; after which she poured from rich carchesian goblets generous wine and warm milk , grateful to propitious Gods — the Deities of earth on whom she called — entreating , as she did so , Pluto , lord of ghostly shades , and ravished Proserpine , that they should not , in undue haste , deprive her patient 's aged limbs of life . When certain she compelled the God 's regard , assured her incantations and long prayers were both approved and heard , she bade her people bring out the body of her father - in - law — old Aeson 's worn out body — and when she had buried him in a deep slumber by her spells , as if he were a dead man , she then stretched him out upon a bed of herbs . She ordered Jason and his servants thence , and warned them not to spy upon her rites , with eyes profane . As soon as they retired , Medea , with disheveled hair and wild abandon , as a Bacchanalian , paced times three around the blazing altars , while she dipped her torches , splintered at the top , into the trenches , dark : with blood , and lit the dipt ends in the sacred altar flames . Times three she purified the ancient man with flames , and thrice with water , and three times with sulphur , — as the boiling mixture seethed and bubbled in the brazen cauldron near . And into this , acerbic juices , roots , and flowers and seeds — from vales Hemonian — and mixed elixirs , into which she cast stones of strange virtue from the Orient , and sifted sands of ebbing ocean 's tide ; white hoar - frost , gathered when the moon was full , the nauseating flesh and luckless wings of the uncanny screech - owl , and the entrails from a mysterious animal that changed from wolf to man , from man to wolf again ; the scaly sloughing of a water - snake , the medic liver of a long - lived stag , and the hard beak and head of an old crow which was alive nine centuries before ; these , and a thousand nameless things the foreign sorceress prepared and mixed , and blended all together with a branch of peaceful olive , old and dry with years . — And while she stirred the withered olive branch in the hot mixture , it began to change from brown to green ; and presently put forth new leaves , and soon was heavy with a wealth of luscious olives . — As the ever - rising fire threw bubbling froth beyond the cauldron 's rim , the ground was covered with fresh verdure — flowers and all luxuriant grasses , and green plants . Medea , when she saw this wonder took her unsheathed knife and cut the old man 's throat ; then , letting all his old blood out of him she filled his ancient veins with rich elixir . As he received it through his lips or wound , his beard and hair no longer white with age , turned quickly to their natural vigor , dark and lustrous ; and his wasted form renewed , appeared in all the vigor of bright youth , no longer lean and sallow , for new blood coursed in his well - filled veins . — Astonished , when released from his deep sleep , and strong in youth , his memory assured him , such he was years four times ten before that day ! — Bacchus , from his celestial vantage saw this marvel , and convinced his nurses might then all regain their former vigor , he pled with Medea to restore their youth . The Colchian woman granted his request . but so her malice might be satisfied Medea feigned she had a quarrel with her husband , and for safety she had fled to Pelias . There , since the king himself was heavy with old age , his daughters gave her generous reception . And these girls the shrewd Medea in a short time won , by her false show of friendliness ; and while among the most remarkable of her achievements she was telling how she had rejuvenated Aeson , and she dwelt particularly , on that strange event , these daughters were induced to hope that by some skill like this their father might regain his lost youth also . And they begged of her this boon , persuading her to name the price ; no matter if it was large . She did not reply at once and seemed to hesitate , and so she held their fond minds in a deep suspense by her feigned meditation . When she had at length declared she would restore his youth , she said to them : “
64871	65135	65138	65138	you	2531	” Straightway a wooly ram , worn out with length of untold years was brought , his great horns curved around his hollow temples . After she had cut his scrawny throat with her sharp knife Thessalian , barely staining it with his thin blood , Medea plunged his carcass in a bronze - made kettle , throwing in it at the same time juices of great potency . These made his body shrink and burnt away his two horns , and with horns his years . And now thin bleating was heard from within the pot ; and even while they wondered at the sound , a lamb jumped out and frisking , ran away to find some udder with its needed milk . Amazed the daughters looked on and , now that these promises had been performed , they urged more eagerly their first request . Three times Phoebus unyoked his steeds after their plunge in Ebro 's stream , and on the fourth night stars shown brilliant on the dark foil of the sky , and then the treacherous daughter of Aeetes set some clear water over a hot fire and put in it herbs of no potency . And now a death - like sleep held the king down , his body all relaxed , and with the king his guards , a sleep which incantations with the potency of magic words had given . The sad king 's daughters , as they had been bid , were in his room , and with Medea stood around his bed . “
65141	65145	65138	65138	you	2531	” Medea said . “
65242	65353	65356	65356	you	2537	” Spurred on by these words , as each one of them was filial she became the leader in the most unfilial act , and that she might not be most wicked did the wicked deed . Not one could bear to see her own blows , so they turned their eyes away ; and every face averted so , they blindly struck him with their cruel hands . The old man streaming with his blood , still raised himself on elbow , and half mangled tried to get up from his bed ; with all those swords around him , he stretched out his pale arms and he cried : “
65374	65720	65721	65721	You	2540	” Their wrong courage left them , and their hands fell . When he would have said still more , Medea cut his throat and plunged his mangled body into boiling water . Only because her winged dragons sailed swiftly with her up to the lofty sky , escaped Medea punishment for this unheard of crime . Her chariot sailed above embowered Pelion — long the lofty home of Chiron — over Othrys , and the vale made famous where Cerambus met his fate . Cerambus , by the aid of nymphs , from there was wafted through the air on wings , when earth was covered by the overwhelming sea — and so escaped Deucalion 's flood , uncrowned . She passed by Pittane upon the left , with its huge serpent - image of hard stone , and also passed the grove called Ida 's , where the stolen bull was changed by Bacchus ' power into a hunted stag — in that same vale Paris lies buried in the sand ; and over fields where Mera warning harked , Medea flew ; over the city of Eurypylus upon the Isle of Cos , whose women wore the horns of cattle when from there had gone the herd of Hercules ; and over Rhodes beloved of Phoebus , where Telchinian tribes dwelt , whose bad eyes corrupting power shot forth ; — Jove , utterly despising , thrust them deep beneath his brother 's waves ; over the walls of old Carthaea , where Alcidamas had seen with wonder a tame dove arise from his own daughter 's body . And she saw the lakes of Hyrie in Teumesia 's Vale , by swans frequented — There to satisfy his love for Cycnus , Phyllius gave two living vultures : shell for him subdued a lion , and delivered it to him ; and mastered a great bull , at his command ; but when the wearied Phyllius refused to render to his friend the valued bull . Indignant , the youth said , “
65728	66506	65721	65721	You	2540	” which having said , he leaped from a high precipice , as if to death ; but gliding through the air , on snow - white wings , was changed into a swan — Dissolved in tears , his mother Hyrie knew not he was saved ; and weeping , formed the lake that bears her name . And over Pleuron , where on trembling wings escaped the mother Combe from her sons , Medea flew ; and over the far isle Calauria , sacred to Latona . — She beheld the conscious fields whose lawful king , together with his queen were changed to birds . Upon her right Cyllene could be seen ; there Menephon , degraded as a beast , outraged his mother . In the distance , she beheld Cephisius , who lamented long his hapless grandson , by Apollo changed into a bloated sea - calf . And she saw the house where king Eumelus mourned the death of his aspiring son . — Borne on the wings of her enchanted dragons , she arrived at Corinth , whose inhabitants , ' tis said , from many mushrooms , watered by the rain sprang into being . There she spent some years . But after the new wife had been burnt by the Colchian witchcraft and two seas had seen the king 's own palace all aflame , then , savagely she drew her sword , and bathed it in the blood of her own infant sons ; by which atrocious act she was revenged ; and she , a wife and mother , fled the sword of her own husband , Jason . On the wings of her enchanted Titan Dragons borne , she made escape , securely , nor delayed until she entered the defended walls of great Minerva 's city , at the hour when aged Periphas — transformed by Jove , together with his queen , on eagle wings flew over its encircling walls : with whom the guilty Halcyone , skimming seas safely escaped , upon her balanced wings . And after these events , Medea went to Aegeus , king of Athens , where she found protection from her enemies for all this evil done . With added wickedness Aegeus , after that , united her to him in marriage . — All unknown to him came Theseus to his kingly court . — Before the time his valor had established peace on all the isthmus , raved by dual seas . Medea , seeking his destruction , brewed the juice of aconite , infesting shores of Scythia , where , ' tis fabled , the plant grew on soil infected by Cerberian teeth . There is a gloomy entrance to a cave , that follows a declivitous descent : there Hercules with chains of adamant dragged from the dreary edge of Tartarus that monster - watch - dog , Cerberus , which , vain opposing , turned his eyes aslant from light — from dazzling day . Delirious , enraged , that monster shook the air with triple howls ; and , frothing , sprinkled as it raved , the fields , once green — with spewing of white poison - foam . And this , converted into plants , sucked up a deadly venom with the nourishment of former soils , — from which productive grew upon the rock , thus formed , the noxious plant ; by rustics , from that cause , named aconite . Medea worked on Aegeus to present his own son , Theseus , with a deadly cup of aconite ; prevailing by her art so that he deemed his son an enemy . Theseus unwittingly received the cup , but just before he touched it to his lips , his father recognized the sword he wore , for , graven on its ivory hilt was wrought a known device — the token of his race . Astonished , Aegeus struck the poison - cup from his devoted son 's confiding lips . Medea suddenly escaped from death , in a dark whirlwind her witch - singing raised . Recoiling from such utter wickedness , rejoicing that his son escaped from death , the grateful father kindled altar - fires , and gave rich treasure to the living Gods . — He slaughtered scores of oxen , decked with flowers and gilded horns . The sun has never shone upon a day more famous in that land , for all the elders and the common folk united in festivities , — with wine inspiring wit and song ; — “
66510	66514	66508	66508	you	2541	” they sang , “
66532	66550	66523	66523	you	2541	“ Yes , you did slay the boar of Cromyon — where now the peasant unmolested plows ; “
66568	66585	66562	66562	he	2542	“ And fierce Procrustes , matched with you beside the rapid river , met his death ; “
66602	66622	66593	66593	his	222	“ And Sinis , a monstrosity of strength , who bent the trunks of trees , and used his might “
66643	66663	66635	66635	he	222	“ Pine tops to shoot men 's bodies through the air . Even the road to Megara is safe , “
66684	66704	66635	66635	he	222	“ His bones a resting place — as tossed about they changed into the cliffs that bear his name . “
66725	66748	66635	66635	he	222	“ For you , brave hero , we give public thanks and prayers ; to you we drain our cups of wine ! ”
67122	67161	67119	67119	he	2575	“ I come imploring you to take up arms , and aid me in the war against my foes ; for I must give that comfort to the shade of my misfortuned son — whose blood they shed . ”
67168	67194	67163	67163	Aeacus	865	“ Nay , it is a vain request you make , for we are bound in strict alliance to the land and people of Cecropia . ”
67219	67228	67209	67209	Minos	860	“ Let such a treaty be your bane . ”
67479	67552	67475	67476	King Aeacus	865	“ Ask not our aid , but take it , Athens ; and count boldly yours all of the force this island holds , and all things which the state of my affairs supplies . My strength for this war is not light , and I have many soldiers for myself and for my enemy . Thanks to the Gods ! the times are happy , giving no excuse for my refusal . ”
67553	67559	67560	67560	Cephalus	826	“ May it prove so , ”
67563	67609	67560	67560	Cephalus	826	“ and may your city multiply in men : just now as I was landing , I rejoiced to meet youths , fair and matched in age . And yet I miss among them many whom I saw before when last I visited your city . ”
67619	67720	67610	67610	Aeacus	865	“ With weeping we began , but better fortune followed . Would that I could tell the last of it , and not the first ! Giving my heart command that simple words and briefly spoken may not long detain . Those happy youths who waited at your need , who smiled upon you and for whom you ask , because their absence grieves your noble mind , they 've perished ! and their bleaching bones or scattered ashes , only may remain , sad remnants , impotent , of vanished power , so recently my hope and my resource . “
67787	67993	67769	67769	Medicines	870	“ Thick darkness , gathered from descending skies , enveloped our devoted land with heat and languid sickness , for the space of full four moons . — Four times the Moon increased her size . Hot south winds blew with pestilential breath upon us . At the same time the diseased infection reached our needed springs and pools , thousands of serpents crawling over our deserted fields , defiled our rivers with their poison . The swift power of the disease at first was limited to death of dogs and birds and cattle , or among wild beasts . The luckless plowman marvels when he sees his strong bulls fall while at their task and sink down in the furrow . Woolly flocks bleat feebly while their wool falls off without a cause , and while their bodies pine away . The prized horse of high courage , and of great renown when on the race - course , has now lost victorious spirit , and forgetting his remembered glory groans in his shut stall , doomed for inglorious death . The boar forgets to rage , the stag to trust his speed ; and even the famished bear to fight the stronger herd . “
68119	68274	68307	68307	their	2613	“ Always it began as if the patient 's bowels were scorched with flames ; red blotches on the body next appeared , and sharp pains in the lungs prevented breath . The swollen tongue would presently loll out , rough and discolored from the gaping mouth , wide - gasping to inhale the noxious air — and show red throbbing veins . The softest bed . And richest covering gave to none relief ; but rather , the diseased would bare himself to cool his burning breast upon the ground , only to heat the earth — and no relief returned . And no physician could be found ; for those who ministered among the sick were first to suffer from the dread disease — the cruel malady broke out upon the very ones who offered remedies . The hallowed art of medicine became a deadly snare to those who knew it best . “
68310	68381	68388	68388	their	2613	“ And many , certain of approaching death , indulged their wicked passions — recklessly abandoned and without the sense of shame , promiscuously huddled by the wells , and rivers and cool fountains ; but their thirst no water could assuage , and death alone was able to extinguish their desire . Too weak to rise , they die in water they pollute , while others drink its death . “
68468	68522	68534	68539	the sovereign of that wretched people	2616	“ And many half - dead wretches staggered out on sultry roads as long as they could stand ; and others weeping , stretched out on the ground , died in convulsions , as their rolling eyes gazed upwards at the overhanging clouds ; under the sad stars they breathed out their souls . “
68559	68603	68555	68555	I	0	“ No matter where my shrinking eyes were turned , I saw a multitude of gruesome forms in ghastly attitudes bestrew the ground , scattered as rotten apples that have dropped from moving branches , or as acorns thick around a gnarled oak . “
68732	68818	68820	68820	I	0	“ While I prepared a sacrifice to Jove , for my behalf , my country and three sons , the victim , ever moaning dismal sounds , before a blow was struck , fell suddenly beside the altar ; and his scanty blood ran thinly from the knives that slaughtered him . His entrails , wanting all the marks of truth were so diseased , the warnings of the Gods could not be read — the baneful malady had penetrated to the heart of life . “
68887	69024	68874	68874	his	2631	“ The bodies of the dead , indecently were cast forth , lacking sacred funeral rites as hitherto the custom . All the gates were crowded with processions of the dead . Unburied , they might lie upon the ground , or else , deserted , on their lofty pyres with no one to lament their dismal end , dissolve in their dishonored ashes . All restraint forgotten , a mad rabble fought and took possession of the burning pyres , and even the dead were ravished of their rest . — And who should mourn them wanting , all the souls of sons and husbands , and of old and young , must wander unlamented : and the land sufficed not for the crowded sepulchers : and the dense forest was denuded of all trees . “
69137	69314	69109	69109	I	0	“ Near by , a sacred oak tree grown from seed brought thither from Dodona , spread abroad its branches thinly covered with green leaves ; and creeping as an army , on the tree we saw a train of ants that carried grain , half - hidden in the deep and wrinkled bark . And while I wondered at the endless line I said , ‘ Good father , give me citizens of equal number for my empty walls . ’ Soon as I said those words , though not a wind was moving nor a breeze , — the lofty tree began to tremble , and I heard a sound of motion in its branches . Wonder not that sudden fear possessed me ; and my hair began to rise ; and I could hardly stand for so my weak knees tottered ! — As I made obeisance to the soil and sacred tree , perhaps I cherished in my heart a thought , that , not acknowledged , cheered me with some hope . “
69438	69512	69538	69538	he	2637	“ When my strange dream departed , I awoke , the vision vanished , I complained to Heaven against the idle comfort of such dreams ; but as I voiced my own lament , I heard a mighty murmur echoing through the halls of my deserted palace , and a multitude of voices in confusion ; where the sound of scarce an echo had disturbed the still deserted chambers for so many days . “
69589	69754	69572	69572	his	2637	“ They all advanced , and hailed me as their king . So soon as I had offered vows to Jove , I subdivided the deserted farms , and dwellings in the cities to these men miraculously raised — which now are called my Myrmidons , — the living evidence of my strange vision . You have seen these men ; and since that day , their name has been declared , ‘ Decisive evidence . ’ They have retained the well - known customs of the days before their transformation . Patiently they toil ; they store the profits of their labor ; which they guard with valiant skill . They 'll follow you to any war , well matched in years and courage , and I do promise , when this east wind turns , this wind that favored you and brought you here , and when a south wind favors our design , then my brave Myrmidons will go with you . ”
69923	70010	69920	69920	he	826	“ It is my pleasure to explore the forest in the chase of startled game , and so I 've learned the nature of rare woods , but never have I seen the match of this from which was fashioned this good javelin ; it lacks the yellow tint of forest ash , it is not knotted like all corner - wood ; although I can not name the kind of wood , my eyes have never seen a javelin - shaft so beautiful as this . ”
70019	70082	69920	69920	he	826	“ But you will find its beauty is not equal to its worth , for whatsoever it is aimed against , its flight is always certain to the mark , nor is it subject to the shift of chance ; and after it has struck , although no hand may cast it back , it certainly returns , bloodstained with every victim . ”
70143	70149	70150	70150	he	826	“ Ah , pity me , ”
70153	70198	70150	70150	he	826	“ If Fate should grant me many years , I must weep every time that I regard this weapon which has been my cause of tears ; the unforgiven death of my dear wife — ah , would that I had never handled it ! “
70235	70329	70337	70337	she	2658	“ ' Tis she her sire Erectheus joined to me , ' Tis she the god Love also joined to me . They called me happy , and in truth I was , and all pronounced us so until the Gods decreed it otherwise . Two joyful months of our united love were almost passed , when , as the grey light of the dawn dispelled , upon the summit of Hymettus green , Aurora , glorious in her golden robes , observed me busy with encircling nets , trapping the antlered deer . “
70432	70457	70424	70424	her	874	“ I told Aurora of our wedding joys and all refreshing joys of love — and my first union of my couch deserted now : “
70511	70624	70504	70504	she	4979	“ Alas , as I retraced the weary way , long - brooding over all Aurora said , suspicion made me doubtful of my wife , so faithful and so fair . — But many things reminding me of steadfast virtue , I suppressed all doubts ; until the dreadful thought of my long absence filled my jealous mind : from which I argued to the criminal advances of Aurora ; for if she , so lovely in appearance , did conceal such passion in the garb of innocence until the moment of temptation , how could I be certain of the purity of even the strongest when the best are frail ? “
70673	70719	70663	70663	her	2658	“ Unknown to all my friends , I paced the streets of sacred Athens till I reached my home . I hoped to search out evidence of guilt : but everything seemed waiting my return ; and all the household breathed an air of grief . “
70812	70876	70794	70794	her	2658	“ Ah , Phocus , it is wonderful to think of beauty so surpassing fair it seems more lovable in sorrow ! Why relate to you how often she repulsed my feigned attempts upon her virtue ? To each plea she said : ‘ I serve one man : no matter where he may be I will keep my love for one . ’ “
70952	70994	70940	70940	I	0	“ Then , angered at my own success I said , discarding all disguise , ‘ Behold the man whose lavish promise has established proof , the witness of your shameful treachery ; your absent husband has returned to this ! ’ “
71051	71141	71142	71142	She	2667	“ I grieved at her desertion ; and the fires of my neglected love consumed my health ; with greater violence my love increased , until unable to endure such pain , I begged forgiveness and acknowledged fault : nor hesitated to declare that I might yield , the same way tempted , if such great gifts had been offered to me . When I had made abject confession and she had avenged her outraged feelings , she came back to me and we spent golden years in harmony . “
71214	71247	71249	71252	the son of Laius	2678	“ Would you be told the story of both gifts attend my words and you shall be amazed , for never such another sad event has added sorrow to the grieving world . “
71333	71390	71392	71392	they	2686	“ Then all the valiant young men of the realm , with whom I also went , enclosed the field ( where lurked the monster ) in a mesh of many tangled nets : but not a strand could stay its onrush , and it leaped the crest of every barrier where the toils were set . “
71416	71503	71392	71392	they	2686	“ At last all begged me to let slip the leash of straining Tempest ; such I called the hound , my dear wife 's present . As he tugged and pulled upon the tightened cords , I let them slip : no sooner done , then he was lost to sight ; although , wherever struck his rapid feet the hot dust whirled . Not swifter flies the spear , nor whizzing bullet from the twisted sling , nor feathered arrow from the twanging bow ! “
71602	71719	71596	71596	he	2690	“ I then turned to my javelin 's aid ; and while I poised it in my right hand , turned away my gaze a moment as I sought to twine my practiced fingers in the guiding thongs ; but when again I lifted up my eyes , to cast the javelin where the monster sped , I saw two marble statues standing there , transformed upon the plain . One statue seemed to strain in attitude of rapid flight , the other with wide - open jaws was changed , just in the act of barking and pursuit . Surely some God — if any god controls — decreed both equal , neither could succeed . ”
71737	71746	71734	71734	Phocus	867	“ What charge have you against the javelin ? ”
71751	71837	71748	71748	Cephalus	826	“ I must relate my sorrows last ; for I would tell you first the story of my joys — ' Tis sweet to think , upon the gliding tide of those few years of married life , when my dear wife and I were happy in our love and confidence . No woman could allure me then from her ; and even Venus could not tempt my love ; all my great passion for my dearest wife was equalled by the passion she returned . “
71892	71998	72001	72001	I	0	“ And often when my right hand felt its weight , a - wearied of the slaughter it had caused , I would come back to rest in the cool shade , and breezes from cool vales — the breeze I wooed , blowing so gently on me in the heat ; the breeze I waited for ; she was my rest from labor . I remember , ‘ Aura come , ’ I used to say , ‘ Come soothe me , come into my breast most welcome one , and yes indeed , you do relieve the heat with which I burn . ’ “
72030	72064	72067	72067	I	0	“ ‘ You are my comfort , you are my delight ! Refresh me , cherish me , breathe on my face ! I love you child of lonely haunts and trees ! ’ “
72182	72242	72164	72164	she	874	“ So she lamented what was never done ! Her woe incited by a whispered tale , she feared the fiction of a harmless name ! But hope returning soothed her wretched state ; and now , no longer willing to believe such wrong , unless her own eyes saw it , she refused to think her husband sinned . “
72302	72356	72298	72298	I	0	“ ‘ Come here , oh my delight ! ’ And as those words fell from my lips , I thought I heard a soft sound in the thicket , as of moving leaves ; and thinking surely ' twas a hidden beast , I threw this winged javelin at the spot . — “
72445	72505	72428	72428	she	2701	“ I lifted her limp body to my own , in these blood - guilty arms , and wrapped the wound with fragments of my tunic , that I tore in haste to staunch her blood ; and all the while I moaned , ‘ Oh , do not now forsake me — slain by these accursed hands ! ’ “
72618	72663	72604	72604	she	2703	“ So , by those dying words I knew that she had heard me call the name of Aura , when I wished the cooling breeze , and thought I called a goddess , — cause of all her jealous sorrow and my bitter woe “
72741	73299	72736	72736	she	2704	” In tears he folds these things ; and , as they wept in came the aged monarch , Aeacus , and with the monarch his two valiant sons , and troops , new - levied , trained to glorious arms . Now Lucifer unveiled the glorious day , and as the session of the night dissolved , the cool east wind declined , and vapors wreathed the moistened valleys . Veering to the south the welcome wind gave passage to the sons of Aeacus , and wafted Cephalus on his returning way , propitious ; where before the wonted hour , they entered port . King Minos , while the fair wind moved their ship , was laying waste the land of Megara . He gathered a great army round the walls built by Alcathous , where reigned in splendor King Nisus — mighty and renowned in war — upon the center of whose hoary head a lock of purple hair was growing . — Its proved virtue gave protection to his throne . Six times the horns of rising Phoebe grew , and still the changing fortune of the war was in suspense ; so , Victory day by day between them hovered on uncertain wings . Within that city was a regal tower on tuneful walls ; where once Apollo laid his golden harp ; and in the throbbing stone the sounds remained . And there , in times of peace the daughter of king Nisus loved to mount the walls and strike the sounding stone with pebbles : so , when the war began , she often viewed the dreadful contest from that height ; until , so long the hostile camp remained , she had become acquainted with the names , and knew the habits , horses and the arms of many a chief , and could discern the signs of their Cydonean quivers . More than all , the features of King Minos were engraved upon the tablets of her mind . And when he wore his helmet , crested with gay plumes , she deemed it glorious ; when he held his shield shining with gold , no other seemed so grand ; and when he poised to hurl the tough spear home , she praised his skill and strength ; and when he bent his curving bow with arrow on the cord , she pictured him as Phoebus taking aim , — but when , arrayed in purple , and upon the back of his white war horse , proudly decked with richly broidered housings , he reined in the nervous steed , and took his helmet off , showing his fearless features , then the maid , daughter of Nisus , could control herself no longer ; and a frenzy seized her mind . She called the javelin happy which he touched , and blessed were the reins within his hand . She had an impulse to direct her steps , a tender virgin , through the hostile ranks , or cast her body from the topmost towers into the Gnossian camp . She had a wild desire to open to the enemy the heavy brass - bound gates , or anything that Minos could desire . And as she sat beholding the white tents , she cried , “
73369	73398	73361	73361	he	860	“ O , supreme of mankind ! she who bore you must have been as beautiful as you are ; ample cause for Jove to lose his heart . “
73433	73511	73512	73512	He	860	“ Then would I implore what dowry he could wish , and would provide whatever he might ask , except alone the city of my father . Perish all my secret hopes before one act of mine should offer treason to accomplish it . And yet , the kindness of a conqueror has often proved a blessing , manifest to those who were defeated . Certainly the war he carries on is justified by his slain son . “
73577	73616	73626	73626	his	860	“ Ah , Minos , how I fear the bitter fate should any warrior hurl his cruel spear and pierce you by mischance , for surely none can be so hardened to transfix your breast with purpose known . ”
73670	73728	73729	73734	Another woman crazed with passionate desires	2713	“ A guard surrounds the gates , my father keeps the keys , and he alone is my obstruction , and the innocent account of my despair . Would to the Gods I had no father ! Is not man the God of his own fortune , though his idle prayers avail not to compel his destiny ? “
73817	73933	73935	73935	my	0	” While Scylla said this , night that heals our cares came on , and she grew bolder in the dark . And now it is the late and silent hour when slumber takes possession of the breast . Outwearied with the cares of busy day ; then as her father slept , with stealthy tread she entered his abode , and there despoiled , and clipped his fatal lock of purple hair . Concealing in her bosom the sad prize of crime degenerate , she at once went forth a gate unguarded , and with shameless haste sped through the hostile army to the tent of Minos , whom , astonished , she addressed : “
74018	74059	74064	74068	Despised abomination of our time	2719	” And as she spoke she held out in her guilty hand the prize , and begged him to accept it with her love . Shocked at the thought of such a heinous crime , Minos refused , and said , “
74116	74241	74112	74112	Jupiter	475	” So Minos spoke . Nevertheless he conquered Megara , ( so aided by the damsel 's wicked deed ) and as a just and mighty king imposed his own conditions on the vanquished land . He ordered his great fleet to tarry not ; the hawsers were let loose , and the long oars quickly propelled his brazen - pointed ships . — When Scylla saw them launching forth , observed them sailing on the mighty deep , she called with vain entreaties ; but at last , aware the prince ignored her and refused to recompense her wickedness , enraged , and raving , she held up her impious hands , her long hair streaming on the wind , — and said : “
74320	74405	74422	74423	your mother	5112	“ Forsaken by my prince , shall I return to my defeated land ? If never ruined it would shut its walls against me . — Shall I seek my father 's face whom I delivered to all - conquering arms ? My fellow - citizens despise my name ; my friends and neighbors hate me ; I have shut the world against me , only in the hope that Crete would surely welcome me ; — and now , he has forbidden me . “
74495	74570	74571	74572	That woman	2739	“ Let your vengeance fall upon me , O my father Nisus , let the ruined city I betrayed rejoice at my misfortunes — richly merited — destroy me , you whom I have ruined ; — I should perish for my crimes ! But why should you , who conquered by my crime , abandon me ? The treason to my father and my land becomes an act of kindness in your cause . “
74622	74694	74602	74602	Pasiphae	880	“ Do my complaints reach your unwilling ears ? Or do the same winds waft away my words that blow upon your ships , ungrateful man ? — Ah , wretched that I am , he takes delight in hastening from me . The deep waves resound as smitten by the oars , his ship departs ; and I am lost and even my native land is fading from his sight . “
74743	74880	74881	74881	Ciris	881	” And as she spoke , she leaped into the waves , and followed the receding ships — for strength from passion came to her . And soon she clung unwelcome , to the sailing Gnossian ship . Meanwhile , the Gods had changed her father 's form and now he hovered over the salt deep , a hawk with tawny wings . So when he saw his daughter clinging to the hostile ship he would have torn her with his rending beak ; — he darted towards her through the yielding air . In terror she let go , but as she fell the light air held her from the ocean spray ; her feather - weight supported by the breeze ; she spread her wings , and changed into a bird . They called her “
74882	74890	74891	74891	Ciris	881	” when she cut the wind , and “
74892	75263	75265	75265	Minos	860	” — cut - the - lock — remains her name . King Minos , when he reached the land of Crete and left his ships , remembered he had made a vow to Jupiter , and offered up a hundred bulls . — The splendid spoils of war adorned his palace . — Now the infamous reproach of Crete had grown , till it exposed the double - natured shame . So , Minos , moved to cover his disgrace , resolved to hide the monster in a prison , and he built with intricate design , by Daedalus contrived , an architect of wonderful ability , and famous . This he planned of mazey wanderings that deceived the eyes , and labyrinthic passages involved . so sports the clear Maeander , in the fields of Phrygia winding doubtful ; back and forth it meets itself , until the wandering stream fatigued , impedes its wearied waters ' flow ; from source to sea , from sea to source involved . So Daedalus contrived innumerous paths , and windings vague , so intricate that he , the architect , hardly could retrace his steps . In this the Minotaur was long concealed , and there devoured Athenian victims sent three seasons , nine years each , till Theseus , son of Aegeus , slew him and retraced his way , finding the path by Ariadne 's thread . Without delay the victor fled from Crete , together with the loving maid , and sailed for Dia Isle of Naxos , where he left the maid forlorn , abandoned . Her , in time , lamenting and deserted , Bacchus found and for his love immortalized her name . He set in the dark heavens the bright crown that rested on her brows . Through the soft air it whirled , while all the sparkling jewels changed to flashing fires , assuming in the sky between the Serpent - holder and the Kneeler the well - known shape of Ariadne 's Crown . But Daedalus abhorred the Isle of Crete — and his long exile on that sea - girt shore , increased the love of his own native place . “
75273	75277	75265	75265	Minos	860	” He said , “
75309	75486	75487	75487	My	0	” This said , he turned his mind to arts unknown and nature unrevealed . He fashioned quills and feathers in due order — deftly formed from small to large , as any rustic pipe prom straws unequal slants . He bound with thread the middle feathers , and the lower fixed with pliant wax ; till so , in gentle curves arranged , he bent them to the shape of birds . While he was working , his son Icarus , with smiling countenance and unaware of danger to himself , perchance would chase the feathers , ruffled by the shifting breeze , or soften with his thumb the yellow wax , and by his playfulness retard the work his anxious father planned . But when at last the father finished it , he poised himself , and lightly floating in the winnowed air waved his great feathered wings with bird - like ease . And , likewise he had fashioned for his son such wings ; before they ventured in the air he said , “
75556	75846	75849	75849	you	2748	” As he spoke he fitted on his son the plumed wings with trembling hands , while down his withered cheeks the tears were falling . Then he gave his son a last kiss , and upon his gliding wings assumed a careful lead solicitous . As when the bird leads forth her tender young , from high - swung nest to try the yielding air ; so he prevailed on willing Icarus ; encouraged and instructed him in a]l the fatal art ; and as he waved his wings looked backward on his son . Beneath their flight , the fisherman while casting his long rod , or the tired shepherd leaning on his crook , or the rough plowman as he raised his eyes , astonished might observe them on the wing , and worship them as Gods . Upon the left they passed by Samos , Juno 's sacred isle ; Delos and Paros too , were left behind ; and on the right Lebinthus and Calymne , fruitful in honey . Proud of his success , the foolish Icarus forsook his guide , and , bold in vanity , began to soar , rising upon his wings to touch the skies ; but as he neared the scorching sun , its heat softened the fragrant wax that held his plumes ; and heat increasing melted the soft wax — he waved his naked arms instead of wings , with no more feathers to sustain his flight . And as he called upon his father 's name his voice was smothered in the dark blue sea , now called Icarian from the dead boy 's name . The unlucky father , not a father , called , “
75853	75855	75858	75858	you	2748	” and “
75870	76472	75864	75864	I	0	” He called again ; and then he saw the wings of his dear Icarus , floating on the waves ; and he began to rail and curse his art . He found the body on an island shore , now called Icaria , and at once prepared to bury the unfortunate remains ; but while he labored a pert partridge near , observed him from the covert of an oak , and whistled his unnatural delight . Know you the cause ? ' Twas then a single bird , the first one of its kind . ' Twas never seen before the sister of Daedalus had brought him Perdix , her dear son , to be his pupil . And as the years went by the gifted youth began to rival his instructor 's art . He took the jagged backbone of a fish , and with it as a model made a saw , with sharp teeth fashioned from a strip of iron . And he was first to make two arms of iron , smooth hinged upon the center , so that one would make a pivot while the other , turned , described a circle . Wherefore Daedalus enraged and envious , sought to slay the youth and cast him headlong from Minerva 's fane , — then spread the rumor of an accident . But Pallas , goddess of ingenious men , saving the pupil changed him to a bird , and in the middle of the air he flew on feathered wings ; and so his active mind — and vigor of his genius were absorbed into his wings and feet ; although the name of Perdix was retained . The Partridge hides in shaded places by the leafy trees its nested eggs among the bush 's twigs ; nor does it seek to rise in lofty flight , for it is mindful of its former fall . Wearied with travel Daedalus arrived at Sicily , — where Cocalus was king ; and when the wandering Daedalus implored the monarch 's kind protection from his foe , he gathered a great army for his guest , and gained renown from an applauding world . Now after Theseus had destroyed in Crete the dreadful monster , Athens then had ceased to pay her mournful tribute ; and with wreaths her people decked the temples of the Gods ; and they invoked Minerva , Jupiter , and many other Gods whom they adored , with sacrifice and precious offerings , and jars of Frankincense . Quick - flying Fame had spread reports of Theseus through the land ; and all the peoples of Achaia , from that day , when danger threatened would entreat his aid . So it befell , the land of Calydon , through Meleager and her native hero , implored the valiant Theseus to destroy a raging boar , the ravage of her realm . Diana in her wrath had sent the boar to wreak her vengeance ; and they say the cause was this : — The nation had a fruitful year , for which the good king Oeneus had decreed that all should offer the first fruits of corn to Ceres — and to Bacchus wine of grapes — and oil of olives to the golden haired Minerva . Thus , the Gods were all adored , beginning with the lowest to the highest , except alone Diana , and of all the Gods her altars only were neglected . No frankincense unto her was given ! Neglect enrages even Deities . “
76480	76484	75864	75864	I	0	” she cried , “
76497	77081	77083	77084	the husband	1379	” And so the boar was sent to ravage the fair land of Calydon . And this avenging boar was quite as large as bulls now feeding on the green Epirus , and larger than the bulls of Sicily . A dreadful boar . — His burning , bloodshot eyes seemed coals of living fire , and his rough neck was knotted with stiff muscles , and thick - set with bristles like sharp spikes . A seething froth dripped on his shoulders , and his tusks were like the spoils of Ind. Discordant roars reverberated from his hideous jaws ; and lightning — belched forth from his horrid throat — scorched the green fields . He trampled the green corn and doomed the farmer to lament his crops , in vain the threshing - floor has been prepared , in vain the barns await the promised yield . Long branches of the vine and heavy grapes are scattered in confusion , and the fruits and branches of the olive tree , whose leaves should never wither , are cast on the ground . His spleen was vented on the simple flocks , which neither dogs nor shepherd could protect ; and the brave bulls could not defend their herds . The people fled in all directions from the fields , for safety to the cities . Terror reigned . There seemed no remedy to save the land , till Meleager chose a band of youths , united for the glory of great deeds . What heroes shall immortal song proclaim ? Castor and Pollux , twins of Tyndarus ; one famous for his skill in horsemanship , the other for his boxing . Jason , too , was there , the glorious builder of the world 's first ship , and Theseus with his friend Perithous , and Toxeus and Plexippus , fated sons of Thestius , and the son of Aphareus , Lynkeus with his fleet - foot brother Idas and Caeneus , first a woman then a man the brave Leucippus and the argonaut Acastus , swift of dart ; and warlike Dryas , Hippothous and Phoenix , not then blind , the son of King Amyntor , and the twain who sprung from Actor , Phyleus thither brought from Elis ; Telamon was one of them and even Peleus , father of the great Achilles ; and the son of Pheres joined , and Iolas , the swift Eurytion , Echion fleet of foot , Narycian Lelex — and Panopeus , and Hyleus and Hippasus , and Nestor ( youthful then ) , and the four sons Hippocoon from eld Amyclae sent , the father - in - law of queen Penelope , Ancaeus of Arcadia , and the wise soothsayer Mopsus , and the prophet , son of Oeclus , victim of a traitor - wife . — And Atalanta , virgin of the groves , of Mount Lycaeus , glory of her sex ; a polished buckle fastened her attire ; her lustrous hair was fashioned in a knot ; her weapons rattled in an ivory case , swung from her white left shoulder , and she held a bow in her left hand . Her face appeared as maidenly for boy , or boyish for girl . When Meleager saw her , he at once longed for her beauty , though some god forbade . The fires of love flamed in him ; and he said , “
77091	77365	77083	77084	the husband	1379	” Neither the time nor his own modesty permitted him to say another word . But now the dreadful contest with the boar engaged this hero 's energy and thought . A wood , umbrageous , not impaired with age , slopes from a plain and shadows the wide fields , and there this band of valiant heroes went — eager to slay the dreaded enemy , some spread the nets and some let loose the dogs , some traced the wide spoor of the monster 's hoofs . There is a deep gorge where the rivulets that gather from the rain , discharge themselves ; and there the bending willow , the smooth sedge , the marsh - rush , ozier and tall tangled reed in wild profusion cover up the marsh . Aroused from this retreat the startled boar , as quick as lightning from the clashing clouds crashed all the trees that cumbered his mad way . — The young men raised a shout , leveled their spears , and brandished their keen weapons ; but the boar rushed onward through the yelping dogs , and scattered them with deadly sidelong stroke . Echion was the first to hurl his spear , but slanting in its course it only glanced a nearby maple tree , and next the spear of long - remembered Jason cut the air ; so swiftly hurled it seemed it might transfix the boar 's back , but with over - force it sped beyond the monster . Poising first his dart , the son of Ampyx , as he cast it , he implored Apollo , “
77393	77804	77386	77386	my	0	” Apollo heard , and guided the swift spear , but as it sped Diana struck the iron head from the shaft , and the blunt wood fell harmless from his hide . Then was the monster 's savage anger roused ; as the bright lightning 's flash his red eyes flamed ; his breath was hot as fire . As when a stone is aimed at walls or strong towers , which protect encompassed armies , — launched by the taut rope it strikes with dreaded impact ; so the boar with fatal onset rushed among this band of noble lads , and stretched upon the ground Eupalamon and Pelagon whose guard was on the right ; and their companions bore their bodies from the field . Another youth , the brave son of Hippocoon received a deadly wound — while turning to escape , the sinew of his thigh was cut and failed to bear his tottering steps . — And Nestor might have perished then , so long before he fought the heroes of old Troy , but ever wise , he vaulted on his long lance from the ground into the branches of a sheltering tree ; where in a safe position , he could look down on his baffled foe . The raging boar whetted his gleaming tushes on an oak . Then with his sharpened tusks he gored the thigh of mighty Hippasus . Observed of all , and mounted on their horses — whiter than the northern snow — the twins ( long afterward transformed to constellations ) sallied forth , and brandishing their lances , poised in air , determined to destroy the bristling boar . It thwarted their design by hiding in a thicket intricate ; where neither steed nor lance could penetrate . But Telamon pursued undaunted , and in haste tripped up by tangled roots , fell headlong . — Peleus stooped to rescue him . While he regained his feet , the virgin , Atalanta , took her bow and fitting a sharp arrow to the notch , twanged the tight cord . The feathered shaft quivered beneath the monster 's ear , the red blood stained his hard bristles . Flushed with her success rejoiced the maid , but not more gladly than the hero Meleager . He it was who first observed the blood , and pointed out the stain to his companions as he cried , “
77814	77870	77386	77386	my	0	” Unwilling to be worsted by a maid , the rushing heroes raised a mighty cry and as they shouted in excitement , hurled their weapons in confusion ; and so great the multitude their actions interfered . Behold ! Ancaeus wielding his war - axe , and rushing madly to his fate , exclaimed , “
77910	78017	77900	77900	her	484	” So mighty in his boast he puffed himself ; and , lifting with both hands his double - edged axe , he stood erect , on tiptoe fiercely bold . The savage boar caught him , and ripped his tushes through his groin , a spot where death is sure . — Ancaeus fell ; and his torn entrails and his crimson blood stained the fair verdure of the spot with death . Ixion 's doughty son was running straight against the monster , shaking his long lance with nervous vigor in his strong right hand ; but Theseus , standing at a distance called : “
78047	78290	78042	78042	Ancaeus	916	” Even as he spoke he balanced in his hand his brazen - pointed lance of corner wood ; with aim so true it seemed the great boar 's death was certain , but an evergreen oak branch shielded the beast . — Then Jason hurled his dart , which turned by chance , transfixed a luckless dog and pinned him yelping , to the sanguine earth . — So fared those heroes . Better fortune gave success to Meleager ; first he threw a spear that missed and quivered in the ground ; but next he hurled a spear with certain aim . It pierced the middle of the monster 's back ; and rushing in upon the dreaded beast , while raging it was whirling round and round , the fearless prince provoked to greater rage the wounded adversary . Bloody froth dripped down his champing jaws — his purple blood poured from a rankling wound . Without delay the mighty Meleager plunged a spear deep in the monster 's shoulder . All his friends raised a glad shout , and gathering round him , tried to grasp his hand . — With wonder they beheld the monster 's bulk stretched out upon the plain ; and fearful still to touch him , they began to stain their weapons in his spouting blood . At length the hero Meleager pressed his conquering foot upon the monster 's head and said , “
78322	78383	78294	78298	glorious maid , of Nonacris	2758	” And while he spoke , he gave to her the pelt , covered with horrid bristles , and the head frightful with gory tusks : and she rejoiced in Meleager and his royal gift . But all the others , envious , began to murmur ; and the sons of Thestius levelled their pointed spears , and shouted out ; “
78426	78461	78421	78423	your witless lover	2760	” So threatened they and took from her the prize ; and forcibly despoiled him of his rights . The warlike prince , indignant and enraged , — rowed with resentment , shouted out . “
78484	78699	78466	78466	You	2758	” And with his cruel sword he pierced the breast of rash Plexippus , taken unawares , and while his brother , Toxeus , struck with fear , stood hesitating whether to avenge or run to safety , Meleager plunged the hot sword , smoking with a brother 's blood , in his breast also . And so perished they . Ere this , Althaea , mother of the prince , and sister of the slaughtered twain , — because her son had killed the boar , made haste to bear rich offerings to the temples of the Gods ; but when she saw her slaughtered brothers borne in sad procession , she began to shriek , and filled the city with her wild lament . Unwilling to abide her festal robes she dressed in sable . — When she was informed her own son Meleager was the cause , she banished grief and lamentations , — thirsting for vengeance . She remembered well , how , when she lay in childbirth round her stood the three attendant sisters of his fate . There was a billet in the room , and this they took and cast upon the wasting flames , and as they spun and drew the fatal threads they softly chanted , “
78726	79029	79077	79080	Relentless Gods of punishment	2768	” And having spoken so , they vanished in the smoke . Althaea snatched the billet from the fire , and having quenched it with drawn water , hid it long and secretly in her own room , where , thus preserved , it acted as a charm to save the life of Meleager . This the mother now brought forth , and fetched a pile of seasoned tinder ready for the torch . She lit the torches and the ready pile , and as the flames leaped up , four times prepared to cast the fatal billet in the midst ; and four times hesitated to commit the dreadful deed , — so long the contest veered between the feelings of a mother 's breast and the fierce vengeance of a sister 's rage . Now is the mother 's visage pale with fear , and now the sister 's sanguinary rage glows in her eyes . Her countenance contorts with cruel threats and in bewildered ways dissolves compassionate : And even when the heat of anger had dried up her eyes the conflict of her passion brought new tears . As when the wind has seized upon a ship and blows against a tide of equal force , the vexed vessel feels repellent powers , and with unsteady motion sways to both ; so did Althaea hesitate between the conflict of her passions : when her rage had cooled , her fury was as fast renewed : but always the unsatisfied desire of blood , to ease the disembodied shades of her slain brothers , seemed to overcome the mother - instinct ; and intensity of conduct proved the utmost test of love . She took the billet in her arms and stood before the leaping flames , and said , “
79042	79071	79072	79072	You	2766	” And as she held in her relentless hand the destiny of him she loved , and stood before the flames , in all her wretchedness she moaned , “
79121	79339	79077	79080	Relentless Gods of punishment	2768	“ Let these accumulating woes destroy a wicked race . Shall happy Oeneus bask in the great fame of his victorious son , and Thestius mourn without slaughtered ones ? ' Tis better they should both lament the deed ! Witness the act of my affection , shades of my departed brothers ! and accept my funeral offering , given at a cost beyond my strength to bear . Ah wretched me ! Distracted is my reason ! Pity me , the yearnings of a stricken mother 's heart withholding me from duty ! Aye , although his punishment be just , my hands refuse the office of such vengeance . What , shall he alive , victorious , flushed with his success , inherit the broad realms of Calydon , and you , my slaughtered brothers , unavenged , dissolved in ashes , float upon the air , unpalpitating phantoms ? How can I endure the thought of it ? Oh let the wretch forever perish , and with him be lost the hopes of his sad father , in the wreck of his distracted kingdom . Where are now the love and feelings of a mother ; how can I forget the bitter pangs endured while twice times five the slow moon waxed and waned ? “
79428	79539	79540	79540	She	2772	“ What dreadful deed can satisfy the law , when I for love against my love am forced ? For even as my brothers ' wounds appear in visions dreadful to denounce my son , the love so nurtured in a mother 's breast breaks down the resolution ! Wretched me ! Such vengeance for my brothers overcomes first at your birth I gave it , and again the yearning of a mother for her son ! Let not my love denounce my vengeance ! My soul may follow with its love the shade of him I sacrifice , and following him my shade and his and yours unite below . ”
80013	80149	79998	79998	Achelous	922	“ O famous son of Athens , come to me , beneath my roof , and leave my rapid floods ; for they are wo nt to bear enormous beams , and hurl up heavy stones to bar the way , — mighty with roaring , down the steep ravines . And I have seen the sheep - folds on my banks swept down the flood , together with the sheep ; and in the current neither strength availed the ox for safety , nor swift speed the horse . When rushed the melting snows from mountain peaks how many bodies of unwary men this flood has overwhelmed in whirling waves ! Rest safely then , until my river runs within its usual bounds — till it contains its flowing waters in its proper banks . ”
80155	80168	80153	80153	Theseus	856	“ I will make good use of both your dwelling and advice . ”
80331	80352	80323	80323	he	856	“ Declare to me what name that island bears , or is it one or more than one I see ? ”
80362	80527	80323	80323	he	856	“ It is not one we see but five are there , deceptive in the distance . And that you may wonder less at what Diana did , those islands were five Naiads . — Long ago , ten bullocks for a sacrifice they slew ; and when the joyous festival was given , ignoring me they bade all other Gods . Indignant at the slight , I swelled with rage as great as ever when my banks are full , — and so redoubled both in rage and flood , I ravished woods from woods , and fields from fields , and hurled into the sea the very soil , together with the Nymphs , who then at last remembered their neglect . And soon my waves , united with the ocean streams , cut through the solid soil , and fashioned from the one , five islands you may see amid the waves , which men since then , have called Echinades . “
80800	80879	80787	80787	his	2817	“ The Nymph , afraid , still struggled in the deep , and as she swam I touched her throbbing breast ; and as I felt her bosom , trembling still , I thought her soft flesh was becoming hard ; for even then , new earth enclosed her form ; and as I prayed to Neptune , earth encased her floating limbs ; — and on her changing form the heavy soil of that fair island grew . ”
80938	81020	80926	80926	He	2821	“ A foolish fiction ! Achelous , how can such a tale be true ? Do you believe a god there is , in heaven so powerful , a god to give and take away a form — transform created shapes ? Such impious words found no response in those who heard him speak . Amazed he could so doubt known truth , before them all , uprose to vindicate the Gods the hero Lelex , wise in length of days . “
81028	81032	80926	80926	He	2821	” he said , “
81049	81139	80926	80926	He	2821	“ And I have this to tell , for all must know the evil of such words : — Upon the hills of Phrygia I have seen two sacred trees , a lime - tree and an oak , so closely grown their branches interlace . A low stone wall is built around to guard them from all harm . And that you may not doubt it , I declare again , I saw the spot , for Pittheus there had sent me to attend his father 's court . “
81192	81270	81171	81172	mighty Jupiter	475	“ As weary travelers over all the land they wandered , begging for their food and bed ; and of a thousand houses , all the doors were bolted and no word of kindness given — so wicked were the people of that land . At last , by chance , they stopped at a small house , whose humble roof was thatched with reeds and straw ; — and here a kind old couple greeted them . “
81360	81505	81513	81514	the man	5560	“ Now when the two Gods , Jove and Mercury , had reached this cottage , and with bending necks had entered the low door , the old man bade them rest their wearied limbs , and set a bench , on which his good wife , Baucis , threw a cloth ; and then with kindly bustle she stirred up the glowing embers on the hearth , and then laid tinder , leaves and bark ; and bending down breathed on them with her ancient breath until they kindled into flame . Then from the house she brought a store of faggots and small twigs , and broken branches , and above them swung a kettle , not too large for simple folk . And all this done , she stripped some cabbage leaves , which her good husband gathered for the meal . “
81568	81650	81657	81669	the good old dame , whose skirts were tucked up , moving carefully	2837	“ Swung on a peg they had a beechwood trough , which quickly with warm water filled , was used for comfortable washing . And they fixed , upon a willow couch , a cushion soft of springy sedge , on which they neatly spread a well worn cloth preserved so many years ; ' Twas only used on rare and festive days ; and even it was coarse and very old , though not unfit to match a willow couch ! “
81720	81810	81712	81712	she	2837	“ And here is set the double - tinted fruit of chaste Minerva , and the tasty dish of corner , autumn - picked and pickled ; these were served for relish ; and the endive - green , and radishes surrounding a large pot of curdled milk ; and eggs not overdone but gently turned in glowing embers — all served up in earthen dishes . Then sweet wine served up in clay , so costly ! all embossed , and cups of beechwood smoothed with yellow wax . “
81827	81896	81712	81712	she	2837	“ Again they served new wine , but mellow ; and a second course : sweet nuts , dried figs and wrinkled dates and plums , and apples fragrant , in wide baskets heaped ; and , in a wreath of grapes from purple vines , concealed almost , a glistening honey - comb ; and all these orchard dainties were enhanced by willing service and congenial smiles . “
82086	82283	82284	82284	Philemon	927	“ Both obeyed , and leaning on their staves toiled up the steep . Not farther from the summit than the flight of one swift arrow from a hunter 's how , they paused to view their little home once more ; and as they turned their eyes , they saw the fields around their own engulfed in a morass , although their own remained , — and while they wept bewailing the sad fate of many friends , and wondered at the change , they saw their home , so old and little for their simple need — put on new splendor , and as it increased it changed into a temple of the gods . Where first the frame was fashioned of rude stakes columns of marble glistened , and the thatch gleamed golden in the sun , and legends carved , adorned the doors . And al ] the ground shone white with marble rich , and after this was done , the Son of Saturn said with gentle voice , ‘ Now tell us , good old man and you his wife , worthy and faithful , what is your desire ? ’ “
82368	82505	82506	82509	The people of Tyana	2854	“ At once their wishes were fulfilled . So long as life was granted they were known to be the temple 's trusted keepers , and when age had enervated them with many years , as they were standing , by some chance , before the sacred steps , and were relating all these things as they had happened , Baucis saw Philemon , her old husband , and he , too , saw Baucis , as their bodies put forth leaves ; and while the tops of trees grew over them , above their faces , — they spoke each to each ; as long as they could speak they said , ‘ Farewell , farewell , my own ’ — and while they said farewell ; new leaves and branches covered both at once . “
82604	82657	82581	82581	I	0	” He ceased , and this miraculous event , and he who told it , had astonished them . But Theseus above all . The hero asked to hear of other wonders wrought by Gods . The Calydonian River - God replied , and leaning on one elbow , said to him : “
82776	82979	83005	83005	I	0	” Now Erysichthon 's daughter , Mestra , had that power of Proteus — she was called the wife of deft Autolycus . — Her father spurned the majesty of all the Gods , and gave no honor to their altars . It is said he violated with an impious axe the sacred grove of Ceres , and he cut her trees with iron . Long - standing in her grove there grew an ancient oak tree , spread so wide , alone it seemed a standing forest ; and its trunk and branches held memorials , as , fillets , tablets , garlands , witnessing how many prayers the goddess Ceres granted . And underneath it laughing Dryads loved to whirl in festal dances , hand in hand , encircling its enormous trunk , that thrice five ells might measure ; and to such a height it towered over all the trees around , as they were higher than the grass beneath . But Erysichthon , heedless of all things , ordered his slaves to fell the sacred oak , and as they hesitated , in a rage the wretch snatched from the hand of one an axe , and said , “
83015	83148	83005	83005	I	0	” So boasted he , and while he swung on high his axe to strike a slanting blow , the oak beloved of Ceres , uttered a deep groan and shuddered . Instantly its dark green leaves turned pale , and all its acorns lost their green , and even its long branches drooped their arms . But when his impious hand had struck the trunk , and cut its bark , red blood poured from the wound , — as when a weighty sacrificial bull has fallen at the altar , streaming blood spouts from his stricken neck . All were amazed . And one of his attendants boldly tried to stay his cruel axe , and hindered him ; but Erysichthon , fixing his stern eyes upon him , said , “
83163	83202	83005	83005	I	0	” So he turned the poised axe from the tree , and clove his head sheer from his body , and again began to chop the hard oak . From the heart of it these words were uttered ; “
83251	83425	83449	83451	Torpid - Frost	934	” No warning could avert his wicked arm . Much weakened by his countless blows , the tree , pulled down by straining ropes , gave way at last and leveled with its weight uncounted trees that grew around it . Terrified and shocked , the sister - dryads , grieving for the grove and what they lost , put on their sable robes and hastened unto Ceres , whom they prayed , might rightly punish Erysichthon 's crime ; — the lovely goddess granted their request , and by the gracious movement of her head she shook the fruitful , cultivated fields , then heavy with the harvest ; and she planned an unexampled punishment deserved , and not beyond his miserable crimes — the grisly bane of famine ; but because it is not in the scope of Destiny , that two such deities should ever meet as Ceres and gaunt Famine , — calling forth from mountain - wilds a rustic Oread , the goddess Ceres , said to her , “
83532	84196	83520	83520	you	2875	” And she gave to her the reins ; and so the swiftly carried Nymph arrived in Scythia . There , upon the told of steepy Caucasus , when she had slipped their tight yoke from the dragons ' harnessed necks , she searched for Famine in that granite land , and there she found her clutching at scant herbs , with nails and teeth . Beneath her shaggy hair her hollow eyes glared in her ghastly face , her lips were filthy and her throat was rough and blotched , and all her entrails could be seen , enclosed in nothing but her shriveled skin ; her crooked loins were dry uncovered bones , and where her belly should be was a void ; her flabby breast was flat against her spine ; her lean , emaciated body made her joints appear so large , her knobbled knees seemed large knots , and her swollen ankle - bones protruded . When the Nymph , with keen sight , saw the Famine - monster , fearing to draw near she cried aloud the mandate she had brought from fruitful Ceres , and although the time had been but brief , and Famine far away , such hunger seized the Nymph , she had to turn her dragon - steeds , and flee through yielding air and the high clouds ; — at Thessaly she stopped . Grim Famine hastened to obey the will of Ceres , though their deeds are opposite , and rapidly through ether heights was borne to Erysichthon 's home . When she arrived at midnight , slumber was upon the wretch , and as she folded him in her two wings , she breathed her pestilential poison through his mouth and throat and breast , and spread the curse of utmost hunger in his aching veins . When all was done as Ceres had decreed , she left the fertile world for bleak abodes , and her accustomed caves . While this was done sweet Sleep with charming pinion soothed the mind of Erysichthon . In a dreamful feast he worked his jaws in vain , and ground his teeth , and swallowed air as his imagined food ; till wearied with the effort he awoke to hunger scorching as a fire , which burned his entrails and compelled his raging jaws , so he , demanding all the foods of sea and earth and air , raged of his hunger , while the tables groaned with heaps before him spread ; he , banqueting , sought banquets for more food , and as he gorged he always wanted more . The food of cities and a nation failed to satisfy the cravings of one man . The more his stomach gets , the more it needs — even as the ocean takes the streams of earth , although it swallows up great rivers drawn from lands remote , it never can be filled nor satisfied . And as devouring fire its fuel refuses never , but consumes unnumbered beams of wood , and burns for more the more ' tis fed , and from abundance gains increasing famine , so the raving jaws of wretched Erysichthon , ever craved all food in him , was on]y cause of food , and what he ate made only room for more . And after Famine through his gluttony at last had wasted his ancestral wealth his raging hunger suffered no decline , and his insatiate gluttony increased . When all his wealth at last was eaten up , his daughter , worthy of a fate more kind , alone was left to him and her he sold . Descendant of a noble race , the girl refusing to be purchased as a slave , then hastened to the near shore of the sea , and as she stretched her arms above the waves , implored kind Neptune with her tears , “
84216	84274	84199	84199	you	2876	” Although the master , seeking her , had seen her only at that moment , Neptune changed her quickly from a woman to a man , by giving her the features of a man and garments proper to a fisher - man : and there she stood . He even looked at her and cried out , “
84377	84399	84364	84364	her	2883	” By this assured the favor of the god protected her ; delighted to be questioned of herself , she said , “
84477	84748	84471	84472	a woman	5609	” Her master could not doubt it , and deceived retraced his footsteps from the sandy shore . As soon as he had disappeared , her form unchanged , was given back to her . But when her father knew his daughter could transform her body and escape , he often sold her first to one and then another — all of whom she cheated — as a mare , bird , a cow , or as a stag she got away ; and so brought food , dishonestly , to ease his greed . And so he lived until the growing strength of famine , gnawing at his vitals , had consumed all he could get by selling her : his anguish burned him with increasing heat . He gnawed his own flesh , and he tore his limbs and fed his body all he took from it . ah , why should I dwell on the wondrous deeds of others — Even I , O gathered youths , have such a power I can often change my body till my limit has been reached . A while appearing in my real form , another moment coiled up as a snake , then as a monarch of the herd my strength increases in my horns — my strength increased in my two horns when I had two — but now my forehead , as you see , has lost one horn . And having ended with such words , — he groaned . To him the hero , who proclaimed himself a favored son of Neptune , answered now ; “
84764	84783	84471	84472	a woman	5609	” And at once the Calydonian River - God replied , binding with reeds his unadorned rough locks : “
84842	84894	84901	84901	Parthaon	919	“ Deianira ( you may have heard some tales of her ) was once the envied hope of many . She was then a lovely virgin . — I , among the rest who loved this maiden , entered the fair home of her great father Oeneus , and I said ; “
84958	84982	84939	84939	Hercules	857	“ He boasted his descent from Jupiter ; the glory of his labors and great deeds performed at his unjust stepmother 's wish . “
85156	85204	85209	85209	he	475	“ But Hercules , unable to control the flame of his great wrath , scowled as I spoke . He briefly answered me , ‘ My hand excels my tongue ; let me now overcome in fight , and I may suffer your offence of words . ’ “
85446	85513	85515	85515	me	0	“ Thrice in vain Hercules strove to push my breast from his , but I pressed ever closer — till , the fourth attempt succeeding , he unloosed my grip , and breaking from my circling arms drew back , and struck me such a buffet with his hand , it twisted me about , and instantly he clung with all his weight upon my back — “
85657	85802	85651	85651	I	0	“ But Hercules , Alcides , only laughed and in derision of my scheming , said , ‘ It was the pastime of my cradle days to strangle better snakes than you — and though your great length may excel all of your kind , how small a part of that Lernaean snake would you — one serpent be ? It grew from wounds I gave ( at first it had one hundred heads ) and every time I severed one head from its neck two grew there in the place of one , by which its strength increased . This creature then outbranching with strong serpents , sprung from death and thriving on destruction , I destroyed . — What do you think will then become of you , disguised so in deceitful serpent - form , wielding a borrowed weapon not your own “
85839	86277	85811	85811	he	2920	“ Twice was I vanquished , there remained to me a third form so again I changed to seem a savage bull , and with my limbs renewed in that form fought once more . He threw his arms about the left side of my ponderous neck , and dragging on me followed as I ran . He seized on my hard horns , and , tugging turned and twisted me , until he fastened them firm in the surface of the earth ; and pushed me , helpless , to the shifting sand beneath . Not yet content he laid his fierce right hand on my tough horn , and broke and tore it from my mutilated head . — This horn , now heaped with fruits delicious and sweet - smelling flowers , the Naiads have held sacred from that hour , devoted to the bounteous goddess Plenty . ’ All this the River - god said ; then a nymph , a lovely nymph like fair Diana dressed , whose locks were flowing down on either side , came graceful to the board , and brought to them of Autumn 's plenty in an ample horn , and gave to them selected apples for a second course . And now , as early dawn appeared , and as the rising sunlight flashed on golden summits of surrounding hills , the young men waited not until the stream subsiding , had resumed its peaceful way , but all arose , reluctant , and went forth . Then Achelous , in his moving waves , hid his fine rustic features and his head , scarred by the wound which gave the Horn of Plenty . Loss of his horn had greatly humbled him , it was so cherished though his only loss , — but he could hide the sad disgrace with reeds and willow boughs entwined about his head . O , Nessus ! your fierce passion for the same maid utterly destroyed even you , pierced through the body by a flying arrow - point . Returning to the city of his birth great Hercules , the son of Jupiter , with his new bride , arrived upon the bank of swift Evenus — after winter rains had swollen it so far beyond its wo nt , that , full of eddies , it was found to be impassable . The hero stood there , brave but anxious for his bride . Nessus , the centaur , strong - limbed and well - acquainted with those fords , came up to him and said , “
86299	86376	86487	86487	I	0	” And so the hero , with no thought of doubt , trusted the damsel to the centaur 's care , though she was pale and trembling with her fear of the swift river and the centaur 's aid . This done , the hero , burdened as he was with quiver and the lion skin ( for he had tossed his club and curving bow across the river to the other bank ) , declared , “
86392	86467	86487	86487	I	0	” And instantly , he plunged in without thought of where he might cross with most ease , for so he scorned to take advantage of smooth water . And after he had gained the other bank , while picking up his bow which there was thrown , he heard his wife 's voice , anxious for his help . He called to Nessus who was in the act then to betray his trust : “
86566	86627	86628	86628	I	0	” his deed sustained the final warning word . He shot an arrow through the centaur 's back , so that the keen barb was exposed beyond his bleeding breast . He tore it from both wounds , and life - blood spurted instantly , mixed with the deadly poison of Lernaean hydra . This Nessus caught , and muttering , “
86633	86652	86628	86628	I	0	” , he gave his tunic , soaked with blood to Deianira as a gift ; and said , “
86660	86812	86628	86628	I	0	” Now many years passed by , and all the deeds , and labors of the mighty Hercules , gave to the wide world his unequalled fame ; and finally appeased the hatred of his fierce stepmother . All victorious returning from Oechalia , he prepared to offer sacrifice , when at Cenaeum , upon an altar he had built to Jupiter , but tattling Rumor , swollen out of truth from small beginning to a wicked lie , declared brave Hercules , Amphitryon 's son , was burning for the love of Iole . And Deianira — his fond wife — convinced herself , the wicked rumor must be true . Alarmed at the report of his new love , at first , poor wife , she was dissolved in tears , and then she sank in grievous misery . But soon in angry mood , she rose and said : “
86945	87281	87283	87283	Juno	488	” So , torn by many moods , at last her mind fixed on one thought : — she might still keep his love , could certainly restore it , if she sent to him the tunic soaked in Nessus ' blood . Unknowingly , she gave the fatal cause of her own woe to trusting Lichas , whom she urged in gentle words to take the gift , from her to her loved husband Hercules . He , unsuspecting , put the tunic on , all covered with Lernaean hydra 's poison . The hero then was casting frankincense into the sacred flames , and pouring wine on marble altars , as his holy prayers were floating to the Gods . The hallowed heat striking upon his poisoned vesture , caused Echidna - bane to melt into his flesh . As long as he was able he withstood the torture . His great fortitude was strong . But when at last his anguish overcame even his endurance , he filled all the wild of Oeta with his cries : he overturned those hallowed altars , then in frenzied haste he strove to pull the tunic from his back . The poisoned garment , cleaving to him , ripped his skin , heat - shriveled , from his burning flesh . Or , tightening on him , as his great strength pulled , stripped with it the great muscles from his limbs , leaving his huge bones bare . Even his blood audibly hissed , as red - hot blades when they are plunged in water , so the burning bane boiled in his veins . Great perspiration streamed from his dissolving body , as the heat consumed his entrails ; and his sinews cracked , brittle when burnt . The marrow in his bones dissolved , as it absorbed the venom - heat . There was no limit to his misery ; raising both hands up towards the stars of heaven , he cried , “
87373	87627	87370	87370	stepmothers	2940	“ Was it for this I slew Busiris , who defiled his temples with the strangers ' blood ? For this I took his mother 's strength from fierce antaeus — that I did not show a fear before the Spanish shepherd 's triple form ? Nor did I fear the monstrous triple form of Cerberus . — And is it possible my hands once seized and broke the strong bull 's horns ? And Elis knows their labor , and the waves of Stymphalus , and the Parthenian woods . For this the prowess of these hands secured the Amazonian girdle wrought of gold ; and did my strong arms , gather all in vain the fruit when guarded by the dragon 's eyes . The centaurs could not foil me , nor the boar that ravaged in Arcadian fruitful fields . Was it for this the hydra could not gain double the strength from strength as it was lost ? And when I saw the steeds of Thrace , so fat with human blood , and their vile mangers heaped with mangled bodies , in a righteous rage I threw them to the ground , and slaughtered them , together with their master ! In a cave I crushed the Nemean monster with these arms ; and my strong neck upheld the wide - spread sky ! And even the cruel Juno , wife of Jove — is weary of imposing heavy toils , but I am not subdued performing them . “
87689	87807	87682	87687	those who yet believe in Gods	2941	” Just as a wild bull , in whose body spears are rankling , while the frightened hunter flies away for safety , so the hero ranged over sky - piercing Oeta ; his huge groans , his awful shrieks resounding in those cliffs . At times he struggles with the poisoned robe . Goaded to fury , he has razed great trees , and scattered the vast mountain rocks around ! And stretched his arms towards his ancestral skies ! So , in his frenzy , as he wandered there , he chanced upon the trembling Lichas , crouched in the close covert of a hollow rock . Then in a savage fury he cried out , “
87829	87845	87820	87820	you	2942	” Lichas , in terror , groveled at his feet , and begged for mercy — “
87851	88237	88238	88238	Your	2943	” But seizing on him , the crazed Hero whirled him thrice and once again about his head , and hurled him , shot as by a catapult , into the waves of the Euboic Sea . While he was hanging in the air , his form was hardened ; as , we know , rain drops may first be frozen by the cold air , and then change to snow , and as it falls through whirling winds may press , so twisted , into round hailstones : even so has ancient lore declared that when strong arms hurled Lichas through the mountain air through fear , his blood was curdled in his veins . No moisture left in him , he was transformed into a flint - rock . Even to this day , a low crag rising from the waves is seen out of the deep Euboean Sea , and holds the certain outline of a human form , so sure]y traced , the wary sailors fear to tread upon it , thinking it has life , and they have called it Lichas ever since . But , O illustrious son of Jupiter ! How many of the overspreading trees , thick - growing on the lofty mountain - peak of Oeta , did you level to the ground , and heap into a pyre ! And then you bade obedient Philoctetes light a torch beneath it , and then take in recompense your bow with its capacious quiver full of arrows , arms that now again would see the realm of Troy . And as the pyre began to kindle with the greedy flames , you spread the Nemean lion skin upon the top , and , club for pillow , you lay down to sleep , as placid as if , with abounding cups of generous wine and crowned with garlands , you were safe , reclining on a banquet - couch . And now on every side the spreading flames were crackling fiercely , as they leaped from earth upon the careless limbs of Hercules . He scorned their power . The Gods felt fear for earth 's defender and their sympathy gave pleasure to Saturnian Jove — he knew their thought — and joyfully he said to them : “
88456	88753	88450	88450	he	2952	” The Gods confirmed it : and though Juno seemed to be contented and to acquiesce , her deep vexation was not wholly hid , when Jupiter with his concluding words so plainly hinted at her jealous mind . Now , while the Gods conversed , the mortal part of Hercules was burnt by Mulciber ; but yet an outline of a spirit - form remained . Unlike the well - known mortal shape derived by nature of his mother , he kept traces only of his father , Jove . And as a serpent , when it is revived from its old age , casts off the faded skin , and fresh with vigor glitters in new scales , so , when the hero had put off all dross , his own celestial , wonderful appeared , majestic and of godlike dignity . And him , the glorious father of the Gods in the great chariot drawn by four swift steeds , took up above the wide - encircling clouds , and set him there amid the glittering stars . Even Atlas felt the weight of Heaven increase , but King Eurystheus , still implacable , vented his baffled hatred on the sons of the great hero . Then the Argive mother , Alcmena , spent and anxious with long cares , the burden of her old age and her fears , could pass the weary hours with Iole in garrulous narrations of his worth , his mighty labors and her own sad days . Iole , by command of Hercules , had been betrothed to Hyllus , and by him was gravid , burdened with a noble child . And so to Iole , Alcmena told this story of the birth of Hercules : — “
88863	88989	88990	88990	I	0	“ At last , no longer able to endure — ah me , a cold sweat seizes on me now ; only to think of it renews my pains ! Seven days in agony , as many nights , exhausted in my dreadful misery , I stretched my arms to heaven and invoked Lucina and three Nixian deities the guardians of birth . Lucina came ; but before then she had been pledged to give my life to cruel Juno . While Lucina sat on the altar near the door and listened , with her right knee crossed over her left knee , with fingers interlocked , she stopped the birth : and in low muttered tones she chanted Charms which there prevented my deliverance . “
89042	89171	89022	89024	The Theban matrons	2958	“ And there was present of the common class , my maid Galanthis — with her red - gold hair — efficient and most willing to obey her worthy character deserved my love . She felt assured , Juno unjustly worked some spell of strong effect against my life . And when this maid beheld Lucina perched so strangely on the altar , with her fingers inwoven on her knees and tightly pressed together , in a gripping finger - comb , she guessed that jealous Juno was the cause . Quick - witted , in a ringing voice this maid cried out , ‘ Congratulations ! All is well ! Alcmena is delivered — a fine child so safely brought forth — her true prayers approved ! ’ “
89225	89331	89333	89333	she	2960	“ ' Tis said , Galanthis laughed and ridiculed the cheated deity ; and as she laughed the vixen goddess caught her by the hair and dragging her upon the ground , while she was struggling to arise , held her , and there transformed both of her arms to animal forelegs . Her old activity remained ; her hair was not changed , but she did not keep her maiden form : and ever since that day , because she aided with deceitful lips , her offspring are brought forth through the same mouth . Changed to a weasel she dwells now with me . ”
89369	89423	89362	89362	Iole	939	“ O my dear mother , if you weep because of her who was your servant , now transformed into a weasel , how can you support the true narration of my sister 's fate ; which I must tell to you , although my tears and sorrows hinder and forbid my speech ? “
89493	89604	89480	89480	Andraemon	949	“ There is a lake surrounded by sweet lawns , encircling beauties , where the upper slope is crowned with myrtles in fair sunny groves . Without a thought of danger Dryope in worship one day went to gather flowers , ( who hears , has greater cause to be indignant ) delightful garlands , for the water - nymphs , and , in her bosom , carried her dear son , not yet a year old , whom she fed for love . Not far from that dream - lake , in moisture grew a lotus , beautiful in purple bloom , the blossoms promising its fruit was near . “
89674	89733	89740	89740	Dryope	948	“ Who wills , the truth of this may learn from all quaint people of that land , who still relate the Story of Nymph Lotis . She , they say , while flying from the lust of Priapus , was transformed quickly from her human shape , into this tree , though she has kept her name . “
89867	89949	89954	89954	Andraemon	949	“ Alas , her little son , Amphissos , felt his mother 's bosom harden to his touch , and no life - stream refreshed his eager lips . And while I saw your cruel destiny , O my dear sister ! and could give no help , I clung to your loved body and around the growing trunk and branches , hoping so to stop their evil growth ; and I confess , endeavored there to hide beneath the bark . “
90066	90180	90062	90062	your	2978	“ If oaths of wretched women can have force , I swear I have not merited this fate ! Though innocent , to suffer punishment ! And if one word of my complaint is false , I pray I may soon wither , and my leaves fall from me as in blight , and let the axe devote me , wretched to the flames . But take this infant from my branches to a nurse ; and let him often play beneath his tree , — his mother always . Let him drink his milk beneath my shade . When he has learned to talk let him salute me , and in sorrow say “
90191	90279	90280	90280	I	0	” O , let him dread the fate that lurks in ponds , and let him often play beneath his tree , — and let him be persuaded every shrub contains the body of a goddess . — Ah ! Farewell my husband , — sister , — and farewell my father ! If my love remain in you remember to protect my life from harm , so that the pruning - knife may never clip my branches , and protect my foliage from the browsing sheep . “
90424	90546	90401	90401	she	2982	” And all the while that Iole told this , tearful in sorrow for her sister 's fate , Alcmena weeping , tried to comfort her . But as they wept together , suddenly a wonderful event astonished them ; for , standing in the doorway , they beheld the old man Iolaus , known to them , but now transformed from age to youth , he seemed almost a boy , with light down on his cheeks : for Juno 's daughter Hebe , had renewed his years to please her husband , Hercules . Just at the time when ready to make oath , she would not grant such gifts to other men — Themis had happily prevented her . “
90551	90555	90401	90401	she	2982	” she said , “
90607	90696	90598	90598	his	955	“ His own son , dutiful to him , shall be both just and unjust in a single deed ; for he , in vengeance for his father 's death , shall slay his mother , and confounded lose both home and reason , — persecuted both by the grim Furies and the awful ghost of his own murdered mother ; this until his wife , deluded , shall request of him the fatal golden necklace , and until the sword of Phegeus drains his kinsman 's blood . “
90806	90910	90912	90912	you	2994	” When Themis , prophesying future days , had said these words , the Gods of Heaven complained because they also could not grant the gift of youth to many others in this way . Aurora wept because her husband had white hair ; and Ceres then bewailed the age of her Iasion , grey and stricken old ; and Mulciber demanded with new life his Erichthonius might again appear ; and Venus , thinking upon future days , said old Anchises ' years must be restored . And every god preferred some favorite , until vexed with the clamor , Jupiter implored , “
91003	91071	91075	91075	Jupiter	475	“ If I had power to change the course of Fate I would not let advancing age break down my own son Aeacus , nor bend his back with weight of year ; and Rhadamanthus should retain an everlasting flower of youth , together with my own son Minos , who is now despised because of his great age , so that his scepter has lost dignity . ”
91460	91471	91457	91457	she	767	“ Do call me Byblis — never call me sister ! ”
91553	91748	91544	91544	her	767	“ What is this vision of the silent night ? Ah wretched me ! I can not count it true . And , if he were not my own brother , he why is my fond heart tortured with this dream ? He is so handsome even to envious eyes , it is not strange he has filled my fond heart ; so surely would be worthy of my love . But it is my misfortune I am his own sister . Let me therefore strive , awake , to stand with honor , but let sleep return the same dream often to me . — There can be no fear of any witness to a shade which phantoms my delight . — O Cupid , swift of love - wing with your mother , and O my beloved Venus ! wonderful the joys of my experience in the transport . All as if reality sustaining , lifted me up to elysian pleasure , while in truth I lay dissolving to my very marrow : the pleasure was so brief , and Night , headlong sped from me , envious of my coming joys . “
92010	92179	92195	92195	she	3041	“ Tis known the sons of Aeolus embraced their sisters — But why should I think of these ? Why should I take example from such lives ? Must I do as they did ? Far from it ! let such lawless flames be quenched , until I feel no evil love for him , although the pure affection of a sister may be mine , and cherished . If it should have happened first that my dear brother had loved me — ah then , I might have yielded love to his desire . Why not now ? I myself must woo him , since I could not have rejected him , if he had first wooed me . But is it possible for me to speak of it , with proper words describing such a strange confession ? Love will certainly compel and give me speech . But , if shame seal my lips , then secret flame in a sealed letter may be safely told . ”
92214	92241	92211	92211	she	3041	“ Let him see : let me at once confess my frantic passion without repression ! O my wretched heart ! What hot flame burns me ! ”
92356	92359	92351	92351	she	3041	“ Your sister ”
92382	92453	92364	92364	she	3041	“ A health to you , which she who loves you fails to have , unless you grant the same to her . It shames me , oh I am ashamed to tell my name to you , and so without my name , I would I might plead well until the hopes of my desires were realized , and then you might know safely , Byblis is my name . “
92581	92832	92871	92871	she	3047	“ I have been overborne and must confess my passion , while with timid prayers I plead ; for only you can save me . You alone may now destroy the one who loves you best : so you must choose what will be the result . The one who prays is not your enemy ; but one most closely joined to you , yet asks to knit the tie more firmly . Let old men be governed by propriety , and talk of what is right and wrong , and hold to all the nice distinctions of strict laws . But Love , has no fixed law for those whose age is ours , is heedless and compliant . And we have not yet discovered what is right or wrong , and all we should do is to imitate the known example of the Gods . We have no father 's harsh rule , and we have no care for reputation , and no fear that keeps us from each other . But there may be cause for fear , and we may hide our stolen love , because a sister is at liberty to talk with her dear brother — quite apart : we may embrace and kiss each other , though in public . What is wanting ? Pity her whose utmost love compels her to confess ; and let it not be written on her tomb , her death was for your sake and love denied . ”
92915	92927	92931	92931	she	3047	“ My most trusted servant , take these tablets to my — ”
92934	92938	92931	92931	she	3047	“ my brother . ”
93030	93054	93027	93027	he	3050	“ Accursed pander to forbidden lust , be gone ! — before the knowledge of your death is added to this unforeseen disgrace ! ”
93138	93276	93134	93134	she	3050	“ I suffer only from my folly ! why did I so rashly tell him of my wounded heart ? And why did I so hastily commit to tablets all I should have kept concealed ? I should have edged my way by feeling first , obscurely hinting till I knew his mind and disposition towards me . And so that my first voyage might get favorable wind , I should have tested with a close - reefed sail , and , knowing what the wind was , safely fared . But now with sails full spread I have been tossed by unexpected winds . And so my ship is on the rocks ; and , overwhelmed with all the power of Ocean , I have not the strength to turn back and recover what is lost . “
93485	93516	93555	93555	she	3058	“ Perhaps my stupid servant , in mistake , did not approach him at a proper time , and even sought an hour his mind was full of other things . “
93711	93774	93779	93779	she	3060	“ If I do nothing more , my innocence is gone forever . I have written him and wooed him also , in a way so rash and unmistakable , that if I should do nothing more than this , I should be held completely guilty in my brother 's sight — but I have hope , and nothing worse to fear . ”
94344	94428	94331	94331	he	3087	“ There are two things which I would ask of Heaven : that you may be delivered with small pain , and that your child may surely be a boy . Girls are such trouble , fair strength is denied to them . — Therefore ( may Heaven refuse the thought ) if chance should cause your child to be a girl , ( gods pardon me for having said the word ! ) we must agree to have her put to death . ”
94630	94702	94624	94625	the goddess	4979	“ O Telethusa , one of my remembered worshippers , forget your grief ; your husband 's orders need not be obeyed ; and when Lucina has delivered you , save and bring up your child , if either boy or girl . I am the goddess who brings help to all who call upon me ; and you shall never complain of me — that you adored a thankless deity . ”
94788	94794	94784	94785	the mother	5344	“ Feed the dear boy . ”
95063	95179	95057	95057	her	979	“ O what will be the awful dreaded end , with such a monstrous love compelling me ? If the Gods should wish to save me , certainly they should have saved me ; but , if their desire was for my ruin , still they should have given some natural suffering of humanity . The passion for a cow does not inflame a cow , no mare has ever sought another mare . The ram inflames the ewe , and every doe follows a chosen stag ; so also birds are mated , and in all the animal world no female ever feels love passion for another female — why is it in me ? “
95378	95515	95373	95374	a woman	5609	“ Hope of fulfillment can beget true love , and hope keeps it alive . You are deprived of this hope by the nature of your birth . No guardian keeps you from her dear embrace , no watchful jealous husband , and she has no cruel father : she does not deny herself to you . With all that liberty , you can not have her for your happy wife , though Gods and men should labor for your wish . None of my prayers has ever been denied ; the willing Deities have granted me whatever should be , and my father helps me to accomplish everything I plan : she and her father also , always help . But Nature is more powerful than all , and only Nature works for my distress . “
95589	95733	95735	95735	Isis	974	” And so she closed her lips . The other maiden flamed with equal love , and often prayed for Hymen to appear . But Telethusa , fearing that event , the marriage which Ianthe keenly sought , procrastinated , causing first delay by some pretended illness ; and then gave pretence of omens and of visions seen , sufficient for delay , until she had exhausted every avenue of excuse , and only one more day remained before the fateful time , it was so near at hand . Despairing then of finding other cause which might prevent the fated wedding - day , the mother took the circled fillets from her own head , and her daughter 's head , and prayed , as she embraced the altar — her long hair spread out upon the flowing breeze — and said : “
95848	96303	96304	96312	O deities of this dark world beneath the earth	3155	” Tears emphasized her prayer ; the goddess seemed to move — in truth it was the altar moved ; the firm doors of the temple even shook — and her horns , crescent , flashed with gleams of light , and her loud sistrum rattled noisily . Although not quite free of all fear , yet pleased by that good omen , gladly the mother left the temple with her daughter Iphis , who beside her walked , but with a lengthened stride . Her face seemed of a darker hue , her strength seemed greater , and her features were more stern . Her hair once long , was unadorned and short . There is more vigor in her than she showed in her girl ways . For in the name of truth , Iphis , who was a girl , is now a man ! Make offerings at the temple and rejoice without a fear ! — They offer at the shrines , and add a votive tablet , on which this inscription is engraved : these gifts are paid by Iphis as a man which as a maid he vowed to give . The morrow 's dawn revealed the wide world ; on the day agreed , Venus , Juno and Hymen , all have met our happy lovers at the marriage fires ; and Iphis , a new man , gained his Ianthe . Veiled in a saffron mantle , through the air unmeasured , after the strange wedding , Hymen departed swiftly for Ciconian land ; regardless and not listening to the voice of tuneful Orpheus . Truly Hymen there was present during the festivities of Orpheus and Eurydice , but gave no happy omen , neither hallowed words nor joyful glances ; and the torch he held would only sputter , fill the eyes with smoke , and cause no blaze while waving . The result of that sad wedding , proved more terrible than such foreboding fates . While through the grass delighted Naiads wandered with the bride , a serpent struck its venomed tooth in her soft ankle — and she died . — After the bard of Rhodope had mourned , and filled the highs of heaven with the moans of his lament , determined also the dark underworld should recognize the misery of death , he dared descend by the Taenarian gate down to the gloomy Styx . And there passed through pale - glimmering phantoms , and the ghosts escaped from sepulchres , until he found Persephone and Pluto , master - king of shadow realms below : and then began to strike his tuneful lyre , to which he sang : — “
96412	96523	96390	96392	my darling wife	3163	“ If able , I would bear it , I do not deny my effort — but the god of Love has conquered me — a god so kindly known in all the upper world . We are not sure he can be known so well in this deep world , but have good reason to conjecture he is not unknown here , and if old report almost forgotten , that you stole your wife is not a fiction , Love united you the same as others . By this Place of Fear this huge void and these vast and silent realms , renew the life - thread of Eurydice . “
96650	96991	96641	96641	you	3164	” While he sang all his heart said to the sound of his sweet lyre , the bloodless ghosts themselves were weeping , and the anxious Tantalus stopped clutching at return - flow of the wave , Ixion 's twisting wheel stood wonder - bound ; and Tityus ' liver for a while escaped the vultures , and the listening Belides forgot their sieve - like bowls and even you , O Sisyphus ! sat idly on your rock ! Then Fame declared that conquered by the song of Orpheus , for the first and only time the hard cheeks of the fierce Eumenides were wet with tears : nor could the royal queen , nor he who rules the lower world deny the prayer of Orpheus ; so they called to them Eurydice , who still was held among the new - arriving shades , and she obeyed the call by walking to them with slow steps , yet halting from her wound . So Orpheus then received his wife ; and Pluto told him he might now ascend from these Avernian vales up to the light , with his Eurydice ; but , if he turned his eyes to look at her , the gift of her delivery would be lost . They picked their way in silence up a steep and gloomy path of darkness . There remained but little more to climb till they would touch earth 's surface , when in fear he might again lose her , and anxious for another look at her , he turned his eyes so he could gaze upon her . Instantly she slipped away . He stretched out to her his despairing arms , eager to rescue her , or feel her form , but could hold nothing save the yielding air . Dying the second time , she could not say a word of censure of her husband 's fault ; what had she to complain of — his great love ? Her last word spoken was , “
96994	97989	97990	97990	You	3171	” which he could barely hear , and with no further sound she fell from him again to Hades . — Struck quite senseless by this double death of his dear wife , he was as fixed from motion as the frightened one who saw the triple necks of Cerberus , that dog whose middle neck was chained . The sight filled him with terror he had no escape from , until petrified to stone ; or like Olenos , changed to stone , because he fastened on himself the guilt of his wife . O unfortunate Lethaea ! Too boastful of your beauty , you and he , united once in love , are now two stones upon the mountain Ida , moist with springs . Orpheus implored in vain the ferryman to help him cross the River Styx again , but was denied the very hope of death . Seven days he sat upon Death 's river bank , in squalid misery and without all food — nourished by grief , anxiety , and tears — complaining that the Gods of Erebus were pitiless , at last he wandered back , until he came to lofty Rhodope and Haemus , beaten by the strong north wind . Three times the Sun completed his full course to watery Pisces , and in all that time , shunning all women , Orpheus still believed his love - pledge was forever . So he kept away from women , though so many grieved , because he took no notice of their love . The only friendship he enjoyed was given to the young men of Thrace . There was a hill which rose up to a level plateau , high and beautiful with green grass ; and there was not any shade for comfort on the top and there on that luxuriant grass the bard , while heaven - inspired reclined , and struck such harmonies on his sweet lyre that shade most grateful to the hill was spread around . Strong trees came up there — the Chaonian oak the Heliads ' poplar , and the lofty - branched deep mast - tree , the soft linden and the beech , the brittle hazel , and the virgin laurel - tree , the ash for strong spears , the smooth silver - fir , the flex bent with acorns and the plane , the various tinted maple and with those , the lotus and green willows from their streams , evergreen box and slender tamarisks , rich myrtles of two colors and the tine , bending with green - blue berries : and you , too , the pliant - footed ivy , came along with tendril - branching grape - vines , and the elm all covered with twist - vines , the mountain - ash , pitch - trees and arbute - trees of blushing fruit , the bending - palm prized after victories , the bare - trunk pine of tufted foliage , bristled upon the top , a pleasant sight delightful to the Mother of the Gods ; since Attis dear to Cybele , exchanged his human form which hardened in that tree . In all the throng the cone - shaped cypress came ; a tree now , it was changed from a dear youth loved by the god who strings the lyre and bow . For there was at one time , a mighty stag held sacred by those nymphs who haunt the fields Carthaean . His great antlers spread so wide , they gave an ample shade to his own head . Those antlers shone with gold : from his smooth throat a necklace , studded with a wealth of gems , hung down to his strong shoulders — beautiful . A silver boss , fastened with little thongs , played on his forehead , worn there from his birth ; and pendants from both ears , of gleaming pearls , adorned his hollow temples . Free of fear , and now no longer shy , frequenting homes of men he knew , he offered his soft neck even to strangers for their petting hands . But more than by all others , he was loved by you , O Cyparissus , fairest youth of all the lads of Cea . It was you who led the pet stag to fresh pasturage , and to the waters of the clearest spring . Sometimes you wove bright garlands for his horns , and sometimes , like a horseman on his back , now here now there , you guided his soft mouth with purple reins . It was upon a summer day , at high noon when the Crab , of spreading claws , loving the sea - shore , almost burnt beneath the sun 's hot burning rays ; and the pet stag was then reclining on the grassy earth and , wearied of all action , found relief under the cool shade of the forest trees ; that as he lay there Cyparissus pierced him with a javelin : and although it was quite accidental , when the shocked youth saw his loved stag dying from the cruel wound he could not bear it , and resolved on death . What did not Phoebus say to comfort him ? He cautioned him to hold his grief in check , consistent with the cause . But still the lad lamented , and with groans implored the Gods that he might mourn forever . His life force exhausted by long weeping , now his limbs began to take a green tint , and his hair , which overhung his snow - white brow , turned up into a bristling crest ; and he became a stiff tree with a slender top and pointed up to the starry heavens . And the God , groaning with sorrow , said ; “
98017	98074	98076	98078	my loved mother	3174	” Such was the grove by Orpheus drawn together ; and he sat surrounded by assembled animals , and many strange Birds . When he tried the chords by touching with his thumb , and was convinced the notes were all in harmony , although attuned to various melody , he raised his voice and sang : “
98167	98699	98700	98700	You	3179	” The king of all the Gods once burned with love for Ganymede of Phrygia . He found a shape more pleasing even than his own . Jove would not take the form of any bird , except the eagle 's , able to sustain the weight of his own thunderbolts . Without delay , Jove on fictitious eagle wings , stole and flew off with that loved Trojan boy : who even to this day , against the will of Juno , mingles nectar in the cups of his protector , mighty Jupiter . You also , Hyacinthus , would have been set in the sky ! if Phoebus had been given time which the cruel fates denied for you . But in a way you are immortal too . Though you have died . Always when warm spring drives winter out , and Aries ( the Ram ) succeeds to Pisces ( watery Fish ) , you rise and blossom on the green turf . And the love my father had for you was deeper than he felt for others . Delphi center of the world , had no presiding guardian , while the God frequented the Eurotas and the land of Sparta , never fortified with walls . His zither and his bow no longer fill his eager mind and now without a thought of dignity , he carried nets and held the dogs in leash , and did not hesitate to go with Hyacinthus on the rough , steep mountain ridges ; and by all of such associations , his love was increased . Now Titan was about midway , betwixt the coming and the banished night , and stood at equal distance from those two extremes . Then , when the youth and Phoebus were well stripped , and gleaming with rich olive oil , they tried a friendly contest with the discus . First Phoebus , well - poised , sent it awhirl through air , and cleft the clouds beyond with its broad weight ; from which at length it fell down to the earth , a certain evidence of strength and skill . Heedless of danger Hyacinthus rushed for eager glory of the game , resolved to get the discus . But it bounded back from off the hard earth , and struck full against your face , O Hyacinthus ! Deadly pale the God 's face went — as pallid as the boy 's . With care he lifted the sad huddled form . The kind god tries to warm you back to life , and next endeavors to attend your wound , and stay your parting soul with healing herbs . His skill is no advantage , for the wound is past all art of cure . As if someone , when in a garden , breaks off violets , poppies , or lilies hung from golden stems , then drooping they must hang their withered heads , and gaze down towards the earth beneath them ; so , the dying boy 's face droops , and his bent neck , a burden to itself , falls back upon his shoulder : “
98714	98718	98719	98719	I	0	” Moaned Apollo . “
98891	99170	98877	98879	a valiant hero	3181	” And while Phoebus , Apollo , sang these words with his truth - telling lips , behold the blood of Hyacinthus , which had poured out on the ground beside him and there stained the grass , was changed from blood ; and in its place a flower , more beautiful than Tyrian dye , sprang up . It almost seemed a lily , were it not that one was purple and the other white . But Phoebus was not satisfied with this . For it was he who worked the miracle of his sad words inscribed on flower leaves . These letters AI , AI , are inscribed on them . And Sparta certainly is proud to honor Hyacinthus as her son ; and his loved fame endures ; and every year they celebrate his solemn festival . If you should ask Amathus , which is rich in metals , how can she rejoice and take a pride in deeds of her Propoetides ; she would disclaim it and repudiate them all , as well as those of transformed men , whose foreheads were deformed by two rough horns , from which their name Cerastae . By their gates an altar unto Jove stood . If by chance a stranger , not informed of their dark crimes , had seen the horrid altar smeared with blood , he would suppose that suckling calves and sheep of Amathus , were sacrificed thereon — it was in fact the blood of slaughtered guests ! Kind - hearted Venus , outraged by such deeds of sacrifice , was ready to desert her cities and her snake - infested plains ; “
99174	99178	98877	98879	a valiant hero	3181	” said she , “
99241	99848	99854	99855	O Gods	456	” And while she hesitates , in various thoughts of what form they should take , her eyes by chance , observed their horns , and that decided her ; such horns could well be on them after any change occurred , and she transformed their big and brutal bodies to savage bulls . But even after that , the obscene Propoetides dared to deny divinity of Venus , for which fault , ( and it is common fame ) they were the first to criminate their bodies , through the wrath of Venus ; and so blushing shame was lost , white blood , in their bad faces grew so fast , so hard , it was no wonder they were turned with small change into hard and lifeless stones . Pygmalion saw these women waste their lives in wretched shame , and critical of faults which nature had so deeply planted through their female hearts , he lived in preference , for many years unmarried . — But while he was single , with consummate skill , he carved a statue out of snow - white ivory , and gave to it exquisite beauty , which no woman of the world has ever equalled : she was so beautiful , he fell in love with his creation . It appeared in truth a perfect virgin with the grace of life , but in the expression of such modesty all motion was restrained — and so his art concealed his art . Pygmalion gazed , inflamed with love and admiration for the form , in semblance of a woman , he had carved . He lifts up both his hands to feel the work , and wonders if it can be ivory , because it seems to him more truly flesh . — his mind refusing to conceive of it as ivory , he kisses it and feels his kisses are returned . And speaking love , caresses it with loving hands that seem to make an impress , on the parts they touch , so real that he fears he then may bruise her by his eager pressing . Softest tones are used each time he speaks to her . He brings to her such presents as are surely prized by sweet girls ; such as smooth round pebbles , shells , and birds , and fragrant flowers of thousand tints , lilies , and painted balls , and amber tears of Heliads , which distill from far off trees . — he drapes her in rich clothing and in gems : rings on her fingers , a rich necklace round her neck , pearl pendants on her graceful ears ; and golden ornaments adorn her breast . All these are beautiful — and she appears most lovable , if carefully attired , — or perfect as a statue , unadorned . He lays her on a bed luxurious , spread with coverlets of Tyrian purple dye , and naming her the consort of his couch , lays her reclining head on the most soft and downy pillows , trusting she could feel . The festal day of Venus , known throughout all Cyprus , now had come , and throngs were there to celebrate . Heifers with spreading horns , all gold - tipped , fell when given the stroke of death upon their snow - white necks ; and frankincense was smoking on the altars . There , intent , Pygmalion stood before an altar , when his offering had been made ; and although he feared the result , he prayed : “
99872	99881	99864	99864	I	0	” but , he did not dare to add “
99888	99892	99864	99864	I	0	” and said , “
99899	100555	99864	99864	I	0	” Golden Venus heard , for she was present at her festival , and she knew clearly what the prayer had meant . She gave a sign that her Divinity favored his plea : three times the flame leaped high and brightly in the air . When he returned , he went directly to his image - maid , bent over her , and kissed her many times , while she was on her couch ; and as he kissed , she seemed to gather some warmth from his lips . Again he kissed her ; and he felt her breast ; the ivory seemed to soften at the touch , and its firm texture yielded to his hand , as honey - wax of Mount Hymettus turns to many shapes when handled in the sun , and surely softens from each gentle touch . He is amazed ; but stands rejoicing in his doubt ; while fearful there is some mistake , again and yet again , gives trial to his hopes by touching with his hand . It must be flesh ! The veins pulsate beneath the careful test of his directed finger . Then , indeed , the astonished hero poured out lavish thanks to Venus ; pressing with his raptured lips his statue 's lips . Now real , true to life — the maiden felt the kisses given to her , and blushing , lifted up her timid eyes , so that she saw the light and sky above , as well as her rapt lover while he leaned gazing beside her — and all this at once — the goddess graced the marriage she had willed , and when nine times a crescent moon had changed , increasing to the full , the statue - bride gave birth to her dear daughter Paphos . From which famed event the island takes its name . The royal Cinyras was sprung from her ; and if he had been father of no child , might well have been accounted fortunate — but I must sing of horrible events — avoid it daughters ! Parents ! shun this tale ! But if my verse has charmed your thought , do not give me such credit in this part ; convince yourself it can not be true life ; or , if against my wish you hear and must believe it , then be sure to notice how such wickedness gets certain punishment . And yet , if Nature could permit such crimes as this to happen , I congratulate Ismarian people and all Thrace as well , and I congratulate this nation , which we know is far away from the land where this vile abomination did occur . The land we call Panchaia may be rich in balsam , cinnamon , and costum sweet for ointment , frankincense distilled from trees , with many flowers besides . All this large wealth combined could never compensate the land for this detestable , one crime : even though the new Myrrh - Tree advanced on that rich soil . Cupid declares his weapons never caused an injury to Myrrha , and denies his torches ever could have urged her crime . — one of the three bad sisters kindled this , with fire brand from the Styx , and poisoned you with swollen vipers . — It is criminal to hate a parent , but love such as hers is certainly more criminal than hate . The chosen princes of all lands desire you now in marriage , and young men throughout the Orient are vying for your hand . Choose , Myrrha one from all of these for your good husband ; but exclude from such a thought your father only . She indeed is quite aware , and struggles bitterly against her vile desires , and argues in her heart : — “
100727	100804	100835	100836	a father	1601	“ But it is said there are some tribes today , in which the mother marries her own son ; the daughter takes her father ; and by this , the love kind Nature gives them is increased into a double bond . — Ah wretched me ! Why was it not my fortune to be born in that love - blessed land ? I must abide , depressed by my misfortunes , in this place . “
100882	100961	100876	100876	he	783	“ It would be better for me , if we were but strangers to each other ; for I then , could wish to go , and leave my native land , and so escape temptation to this crime : but my unhappy passion holds me here , that I may see Cinyras face to face , and touch him , talk with him and even kiss him — the best , if nothing else can be allowed . “
101124	101269	101274	101274	yourself	3217	” And so she argued and declared her love : but Cinyras , her father , who was urged by such a throng of suitors for her hand , that he could make no choice , at last inquired of her , so she might make her heart 's wish known . And as he named them over , asked her which she fixed her gaze upon her father 's face , in doubtful agony what she could say , while hot tears filled her eyes . Her father , sure it all was of a virginal alarm , as he is telling her she need not weep dries her wet cheeks and kisses her sweet lips . Too much delighted with his gentle words and kind endearments , Myrrha , when he asked again , which one might be her husband , said , “
101276	101289	101274	101274	yourself	3217	” , And he replied not understanding what her heart would say , “
101299	101303	101304	101306	loving - daughter	3219	” When she heard “
101307	101495	101274	101274	yourself	3217	” said , the girl too conscious of her guilt , looked on the ground . It was now midnight , peaceful sleep dissolved the world - care of all mortals , but of her who , sleepless through the night , burnt in the flame of her misplaced affection . First despair compels her to abandon every hope , and then she changes and resolves to try ; and so she wavers from desire to shame , for she could not adhere to any plan . As a great tree , cut by the swinging axe is chopped until the last blow has been struck , then sways and threatens danger to all sides ; so does her weak mind , cut with many blows , waver unsteadily — this way and that — and turning back and forth it finds no rest from passion , save the rest that lies in death . The thought of death gave comfort to her heart . Resolved to hang herself , she sat upright ; then , as she tied her girdle to a beam , she said , “
101512	101743	101503	101503	you	783	” And while she spoke those words , her fingers fixed the noosed rope close around her death - pale neck . They say the murmur of despairing words was heard by her attentive nurse who watched outside the room . And , faithful as of old , she opened the shut door . But , when she saw the frightful preparations made for death , the odd nurse screamed and beat and tore her breast , then seized and snatched the rope from Myrrha 's neck ; and after she had torn the noose apart , at last she had the time to weep and time , while she embraced the girl , to ask her why the halter had been fastened round her neck . The girl in stubborn silence only fixed her eyes upon the ground — sad that her first attempt at death , because too slow , was foiled . The old nurse - woman urged and urged , and showed her gray hair and her withered breasts , and begged her by the memory of her cradle days , and baby nourishment , to hide no more from her long - trusted nurse what caused her grief . The girl turned from her questions with a sigh . The nurse , still more determined to know all , promised fidelity and her best aid — “
101747	101751	101503	101503	you	783	” she said , “
101850	101938	101942	101942	I	0	” And , when she heard her say the name of father , a sigh heaved up from her distracted heart . But even after that the nurse could not conceive such evil in the girl 's sick heart ; and yet she had a feeling it must be only a love affair could cause the crime : and with persistent purpose begged the cause . She pressed the weeping girl against her breast ; and as she held her in her feeble arms , she said , “
101978	102003	101967	101968	your father	5123	” just like a mad girl , Myrrha sprang away , and with her face deep - buried in a couch , sobbed out , “
102029	102160	102171	102171	mother	5115	” Horrified the nurse stretched forth her trembling hands , palsied with age and fear . She fell down at the feet of her loved foster - child , and coaxing her and frightening her , she threatened to disclose her knowledge of the halter and of what she knew of her attempted suicide ; and after all was said , she gave her word to help the girl , when she had given to her a true confession of her sad heart - love . The girl just lifted up her face , and laid it , weeping , on the bosom of her nurse . She tried so often to confess , and just as often checked her words , her shamed face hid deep in her garment : “
102162	102169	102171	102171	mother	5115	” , at last she groans , “
102179	102284	102171	102171	mother	5115	” Only that much she said and groaned . The nurse felt a cold horror stealing through her heart and frame , for she now understood it all . And her white hair stood bristling on her head , while with the utmost care of love and art she strove to use appropriate words and deeds , to banish the mad passion of the girl . Though Myrrha knew that she was truly warned , she was resolved to die , unless she could obtain the object of her wicked love . The nurse gave way at last as in defeat , and said , “
102289	102297	102298	102299	your father	5123	” but did not dare to say , “
102300	102465	102470	102470	Myrrha	1000	” , did not finish , though , she promised and confirmed it with an oath . It was the time when matrons celebrate the annual festival of Ceres . Then , all robed in decent garments of snow - white , they bring garlands of precious wheat , which are first fruits of worship ; and for nine nights they must count forbidden every act of love , and shun the touch of man . And in that throng , Cenchreis , the king 's wife , with constant care attended every secret rite : and so while the king 's bed was lacking his true wife , one of those nights , — King Cinyras was drunk with too much wine , — the scheming nurse informed him of a girl most beautiful , whose love for him was passionate ; in a false tale she pictured a true passion . — When he asked the maiden 's age , she answered , “
102473	102498	102470	102470	Myrrha	1000	” Bidden by the king to go and fetch her , the officious old nurse , when she found the girl , cried out ; “
102509	102795	102470	102470	Myrrha	1000	” The unhappy girl could not feel genuine joy in her amazed and startled body . Her dazed mind was filled with strange forebodings ; but she did believe her heart was joyful . — Great excitement filled her wrecked heart with such inconsistencies . Now was the time when nature is at rest ; between the Bears , Bootes turned his wain down to the west , and the guilty Myrrha turns to her enormity . The golden moon flies from the heaven , and black clouds cover the hiding stars and Night has lost her fires . The first to hide were stars of Icarus and of Erigone , in hallowed love devoted to her father . Myrrha thrice was warned by omen of her stumbling foot ; the funeral screech - owl also warned her thrice , with dismal cry ; yet Myrrha onward goes . It seems to her the black night lessens shame . She holds fast to her nurse with her left hand , and with the other hand gropes through the dark . And now they go until she finds the door . Now at the threshold of her father 's room , she softly pushes back the door , her nurse takes her within . The girl 's knees trembling sink beneath her . Her drawn bloodless face has lost its color , and while she moves to the crime , bad courage goes from her until afraid of her bold effort , she would gladly turn unrecognized . But as she hesitates , the aged crone still holds her by the hand ; and leading her up to the high bed there delivering Myrrha , says , “
102807	102853	102854	102854	daughter	3233	” and leaves the pair doomed in their crime — the father to pollute his own flesh in his own bed ; where he tries first to encourage her from maiden fears , by gently talking to the timid girl . He chanced to call her “
102856	102875	102876	102876	father	1933	” as a name best suited to her age ; and she in turn , endearing , called him “
102877	103054	103056	103056	Gods	456	” , so no names might be omitted to complete their guilt . She staggered from his chamber with the crime of her own father hidden in her womb , and their guilt was repeated many nights ; till Cinyras — determined he must know his mistress , after many meetings , brought a light and knew his crime had harmed his daughter . Speechless in shame he drew forth his bright sword out from the scabbard where it hung near by . — but frightened Myrrha fled , and so escaped death in the shadows of dark night . Groping her pathless way at random through the fields , she left Arabia , famed for spreading palms , and wandered through Panchaean lands . Until after nine months of aimless wandering days , she rested in Sabaea , for she could not hold the burden she had borne so long . Not knowing what to pray for , moved alike by fear of death and weariness of life , her wishes were expressed in prayer : “
103109	103869	103088	103089	the dead	3235	” Some god did listen to her unnatural prayer ; her last petition had answering gods . For even as she prayed , the earth closed over her legs ; roots grew out and , stretching forth obliquely from her nails , gave strong support to her up - growing trunk ; her bones got harder , and her marrow still unchanged , kept to the center , as her blood was changed to sap , as her outstretching arms became long branches and her fingers twigs ; and as her soft skin hardened into bark : and the fast - growing tree had closely bound her womb , still heavy , and had covered her soft bosom ; and was spreading quickly up to her neck . — She can not endure the strain , and sinking down into the rising wood , her whole face soon was hidden in the bark . Although all sense of human life was gone , as quickly as she lost her human form , her weeping was continued , and warm drops distilled from her ( the tree ) cease not to fall . There is a virtue even in her tears — the valued myrrh distilling from the trunk , keeps to her name , by which she still is known , and can not be forgot of aging time . The guilt - begotten child had growth while wood was growing , and endeavored now to find a way of safe birth . The tree - trunk was swelling and tightened against Myrrha , who , unable to express her torture , could not call upon Lucina in the usual words of travail . But then just like a woman in great pain , the tree bends down and , while it groans , bedews itself with falling tears . Lucina stood in pity near the groaning branches , laid her hands on them , and uttered charms to aid the hindered birth . The tree cracked open then , the bark was rent asunder , and it gave forth its living weight , a wailing baby - boy . The Naiads laid him on soft leaves , and they anointed him with his own mother 's tears . Even Envy would not fail to praise the child , as beautiful as naked cupids seen in chosen paintings . Only give to him a polished quiver , or take theirs from them , and no keen eye could choose him from their midst . Time gliding by without our knowledge cheats us , and nothing can be swifter than the years . That son of sister and grandfather , who was lately hidden in his parent tree , just lately born , a lovely baby - boy is now a youth , now man more beautiful than during growth . He wins the love of Venus and so avenges his own mother 's passion . For while the goddess ' son with quiver held on shoulder , once was kissing his loved mother , it chanced unwittingly he grazed her breast with a projecting arrow . Instantly the wounded goddess pushed her son away ; but the scratch had pierced her deeper than she thought and even Venus was at first deceived . Delighted with the beauty of the youth , she does not think of her Cytherian shores and does not care for Paphos , which is girt by the deep sea , nor Cnidos , haunts of fish , nor Amathus far - famed for precious ores . Venus , neglecting heaven , prefers Adonis to heaven , and so she holds close to his ways as his companion , and forgets to rest at noon - day in the shade , neglecting care of her sweet beauty . She goes through the woods , and over mountain ridges and wild fields , rocky and thorn - set , bare to her white knees after Diana 's manner . And she cheers the hounds , intent to hunt for harmless prey , such as the leaping hare , or the wild stag , high - crowned with branching antlers , or the doe . — she keeps away from fierce wild boars , away from ravenous wolves ; and she avoids the bears of frightful claws , and lions glutted with the blood of slaughtered cattle . She warns you , Adonis , to beware and fear them . If her fears for you were only heeded ! “
103874	103878	103088	103089	the dead	3235	” she says , “
103982	103992	103993	103993	I	0	” When he inquires the reason , she says : “
104050	104162	104163	104163	You	3241	” So saying , she reclined upon the turf and , pillowing her head against his breast and mingling kisses with her words , she told him the following tale : Perhaps you may have heard of a swift maid , who ran much faster than swift - footed men contesting in the race . What they have told is not an idle tale . — She did excel them all — and you could not have said whether her swift speed or her beauty was more worthy of your praise . When this maid once consulted with an oracle , of her fate after marriage , the god answered her : “
104209	104236	104237	104237	I	0	” She was so frightened by the oracle , she lived unwedded in far shaded woods ; and with harsh terms repulsed insistent throngs of suitors . “
104243	104247	104237	104237	I	0	” she said , “
104294	104347	104350	104351	a wife	6650	” Indeed she was that pitiless , but such the power of beauty , a rash multitude agreed to her harsh terms . Hippomenes had come , a stranger , to the cruel race , with condemnation in his heart against the racing young men for their headstrong love ; and said , “
104357	104402	104350	104351	a wife	6650	” But when he saw her face , and perfect form disrobed for perfect running , such a form as mine , Adonis , or as yours — if you were woman — he was so astonished he raised up his hands and said , “
104427	104467	104413	104413	I	0	” And as he is praising her , his own heart leaping with love 's fire , he hopes no young man may outstrip her in the race ; and , full of envy , fears for the result . “
104471	104475	104413	104413	I	0	” he cries , “
104490	104676	104413	104413	I	0	” But while the hero weighed it in his mind the virgin flew as if her feet had wings . Although she seemed to him in flight as swift as any Scythian arrow , he admired her beauty more ; and her swift speed appeared in her most beautiful . The breeze bore back the streamers on her flying ankles , while her hair was tossed back over her white shoulders ; the bright trimmed ribbons at her knees were fluttering , and over her white girlish body came a pink flush , just as when a purple awning across a marble hall gives it a wealth of borrowed hues . And while Hippomenes in wonder gazed at her , the goal was reached ; and Atalanta crowned victorious with festal wreath . — But all the vanquished youths paid the death - penalty with sighs and groans , according to the stipulated bond . Not frightened by the fate of those young men , he stood up boldly in the midst of all ; and fixing his strong eyes upon the maiden , said : “
104787	104823	104784	104785	great Hippomenes	1005	” While he was speaking , Atalanta 's gaze grew softer , in her vacillating hopes to conquer and be conquered ; till at last , her heart , unbalanced , argued in this way : “
105065	105219	105052	105052	he	3258	“ Shall he then die , because it must be his one hope to live with me ? And suffer death though undeserved , for me because he loves ? My victory will not ward off the hate , the odium of the deed ! But it is not a fault of mine . — Oh fond , fond man , I would that you had never seen me ! But you are so madly set upon it , I could wish you may prove much the swifter ! Oh how dear how lovable is his young girlish face ! — ah , doomed Hippomenes , I only wish mischance had never let you see me ! You are truly worthy of a life on earth . If I had been more fortunate , and not denied a happy marriage day ; I would not share my bed with any man but you . ”
105283	105311	105279	105279	his	3274	“ I pray to you , O Venus , Queen of Love , be near and help my daring — smile upon the love you have inspired ! ”
105543	105569	105534	105536	the cheering multitude	3287	“ Now is the time to use your strength . Go on ! Hippomenes ! Bend to the work ! You 're sure to win ! ”
105739	105752	105737	105737	He	3274	“ Be near me , goddess , while I use your gift . ”
106453	106495	106450	106450	Fate	959	“ But not everything is at the mercy of your cruel power . My sorrow for Adonis will remain , enduring as a lasting monument . Each passing year the memory of his death shall cause an imitation of my grief . “
106538	106750	106755	106761	the poet who has scorned our love	3320	” Her grief declared , she sprinkled his blood with sweet - smelling nectar , and his blood as soon as touched by it began to effervesce , just as transparent bubbles always rise in rainy weather . Nor was there a pause more than an hour , when from Adonis , blood , exactly of its color , a loved flower sprang up , such as pomegranates give to us , small trees which later hide their seeds beneath a tough rind . But the joy it gives to man is short - lived , for the winds which give the flower its name , Anemone , shake it right down , because its slender hold , always so weak , lets it fall to the ground from its frail stem . While with his songs , Orpheus , the bard of Thrace , allured the trees , the savage animals , and even the insensate rocks , to follow him ; Ciconian matrons , with their raving breasts concealed in skins of forest animals , from the summit of a hill observed him there , attuning love songs to a sounding harp . One of those women , as her tangled hair was tossed upon the light breeze shouted , “
106763	108022	106755	106761	the poet who has scorned our love	3320	” Then hurled her spear at the melodious mouth of great Apollo 's bard : but the spear 's point , trailing in flight a garland of fresh leaves , made but a harmless bruise and wounded not . The weapon of another was a stone , which in the very air was overpowered by the true harmony of his voice and lyre , and so disabled lay before his feet , as asking pardon for that vain attempt . The madness of such warfare then increased . All moderation is entirely lost , and a wild Fury overcomes the right . — although their weapons would have lost all force , subjected to the power of Orpheus ' harp , the clamorous discord of their boxwood pipes , the blaring of their horns , their tambourines and clapping hands and Bacchanalian yells , with hideous discords drowned his voice and harp . — at last the stones that heard his song no more fell crimson with the Thracian poet 's blood . Before his life was taken , the maenads turned their threatening hands upon the many birds , which still were charmed by Orpheus as he sang , the serpents , and the company of beasts — fabulous audience of that worshipped bard . And then they turned on him their blood - stained hands : and flocked together swiftly , as wild birds , which , by some chance , may see the bird of night beneath the sun . And as the savage dogs rush on the doomed stag , loosed some bright fore - noon , on blood - sand of the amphitheatre ; they rushed against the bard , with swift hurled thyrsi which , adorned with emerald leaves had not till then been used for cruelty . And some threw clods , and others branches torn from trees ; and others threw flint stones at him , and , that no lack of weapons might restrain their savage fury then , not far from there by chance they found some oxen which turned up the soil with ploughshares , and in fields nearby were strong - armed peasants , who with eager sweat worked for the harvest as they dug hard fields ; and all those peasants , when they saw the troop of frantic women , ran away and left their implements of labor strown upon deserted fields — harrows and heavy rakes and their long spades after the savage mob had seized upon those implements , and torn to pieces oxen armed with threatening horns , they hastened to destroy the harmless bard , devoted Orpheus ; and with impious hate , murdered him , while his out - stretched hands implored their mercy — the first and only time his voice had no persuasion . O great Jupiter ! Through those same lips which had controlled the rocks and which had overcome ferocious beasts , his life breathed forth , departed in the air . The mournful birds , the stricken animals , the hard stones and the weeping woods , all these that often had followed your inspiring voice , bewailed your death ; while trees dropped their green leaves , mourning for you , as if they tore their hair . They say sad rivers swelled with their own tears — naiads and dryads with dishevelled hair wore garments of dark color . His torn limbs were scattered in strange places . Hebrus then received his head and harp — and , wonderful ! While his loved harp was floating down the stream , it mourned for him beyond my power to tell . His tongue though lifeless , uttered a mournful sound and mournfully the river 's banks replied : onward borne by the river to the sea they left their native stream and reached the shore of Lesbos at Methymna . Instantly , a furious serpent rose to attack the head of Orpheus , cast up on that foreign sand — the hair still wet with spray . Phoebus at last appeared and saved the head from that attack : before the serpent could inflict a sting , he drove it off , and hardened its wide jaws to rigid stone . Meanwhile the fleeting shade of Orpheus had descended under earth : remembering now those regions that he saw when there before , he sought Eurydice through fields frequented by the blest ; and when he found her , folded her in eager arms . Then lovingly they wandered side by side , or he would follow when she chose to lead , or at another time he walked in front , looking back , safely , — at Eurydice . Bacchus would not permit the wickedness of those who slaughtered Orpheus to remain unpunished . Grieving for the loss of his loved bard of sacred rites , at once he bound with twisted roots the feet of everyone of those Edonian women who had caused the crime of Orpheus ' death . Their toes grew long . He thrust the sharp points in the solid earth . As when a bird entangled in a snare , hid by the cunning fowler , knows too late that it is held , then vainly beats its wings , and fluttering only makes more tight the noose with every struggle ; so each woman - fiend whose feet were sinking in the soil , when she attempted flight , was held by deepening roots . And while she looks down where her toes and nails and feet should be , she sees wood growing up from them and covering all her graceful legs . Full of delirious grief , endeavoring to smite with right hand on her changing thigh , she strikes on solid oak . Her tender breast and shoulders are transformed to rigid oak . You would declare that her extended arms are real branches of a forest tree , and such a thought would be the very truth . And not content with this , Bacchus resolved to leave that land , and with a worthier train went to the vineyards of his own Tmolus and to Pactolus , though the river was not golden , nor admired for precious sands . His usual throng of Satyrs and of Bacchanals surrounded him ; but not Silenus , who was then detained from him . The Phrygian folk had captured him , as he was staggering , faint with palsied age and wine . And after they bound him in garlands , they led him to their king Midas , to whom with the Cecropian Eumolpus , Thracian Orpheus had shown all the Bacchic rites . When Midas recognized his old time friend Silenus , who had been so often his companion in the rites of Bacchus , he kept joyful festival , with his old comrade , twice five days and nights . Upon the eleventh day , when Lucifer had dimmed the lofty multitude of stars , King Midas and Silenus went from there joyful together to the Lydian lands . There Midas put Silenus carefully under the care of his loved foster - child , young Bacchus . He with great delight , because he had his foster - father once again , allowed the king to choose his own reward — a welcome offer , but it led to harm . And Midas made this ill - advised reply : “
108036	108437	108025	108025	I	0	” Bacchus agreed to his unfortunate request , with grief that Midas chose for harm and not for good . The Berecynthian hero , king of Phrygia , with joy at his misfortune went away , and instantly began to test the worth of Bacchus ' word by touching everything . Doubtful himself of his new power , he pulled a twig down from a holm - oak , growing on a low hung branch . The twig was turned to gold . He lifted up a dark stone from the ground and it turned pale with gold . He touched a clod and by his potent touch the clod became a mass of shining gold . He plucked some ripe , dry spears of grain , and all that wheat he touched was golden . Then he held an apple which he gathered from a tree , and you would think that the Hesperides had given it . If he but touched a lofty door , at once each door - post seemed to glisten . When he washed his hands in liquid streams , the lustrous drops upon his hands might have been those which once astonished Danae . He could not now conceive his large hopes in his grasping mind , as he imagined everything of gold . And , while he was rejoicing in great wealth , his servants set a table for his meal , with many dainties and with needful bread : but when he touched the gift of Ceres with his right hand , instantly the gift of Ceres stiffened to gold ; or if he tried to bite with hungry teeth a tender bit of meat , the dainty , as his teeth but touched it , shone at once with yellow shreds and flakes of gold . And wine , another gift of Bacchus , when he mixed it in pure water , can be seen in his astonished mouth as liquid gold . Confounded by his strange misfortune — rich and wretched — he was anxious to escape from his unhappy wealth . He hated all he had so lately longed for . Plenty could not lessen hunger and no remedy relieved his dry , parched throat . The hated gold tormented him no more than he deserved . Lifting his hands and shining arms to heaven , he moaned . “
108468	108503	108454	108454	I	0	” How patient are the gods ! Bacchus forthwith , because King Midas had confessed his fault , restored him and annulled the promise given , annulled the favor granted , and he said : “
108580	108854	108855	108855	My	0	” King Midas did as he was told and plunged beneath the water at the river 's source . And the gold virtue granted by the god , as it departed from his body , tinged the stream with gold . And even to this hour adjoining fields , touched by this ancient vein of gold , are hardened where the river flows and colored with the gold that Midas left . Abhorring riches he inhabited the woods and fields , and followed Pan who dwells always in mountain - caves : but still obtuse remained , from which his foolish mind again , by an absurd decision , harmed his life . He followed Pan up to the lofty mount Tmolus , which from its great height looks far across the sea . Steep and erect it stands between great Sardis and the small Hypaepa . While Pan was boasting there to mountain nymphs of his great skill in music , and while he was warbling a gay tune upon the reeds , cemented with soft wax , in his conceit he dared to boast to them how he despised Apollo 's music when compared with his — . At last to prove it , he agreed to stand against Apollo in a contest which it was agreed should be decided by Tmolus as their umpire . This old god sat down on his own mountain , and first eased his ears of many mountain growing trees , oak leaves were wreathed upon his azure hair and acorns from his hollow temples hung . First to the Shepherd - god Tmolus spoke : “
109429	109437	109423	109423	Neptune	472	“ You shall not escape your punishment . ”
109651	109696	109645	109646	aged Proteus	928	“ Oh goddess of the waves , you shall conceive , and you shall be the mother of a youth who by heroic actions will surpass the deeds of his own father , and your son shall be superior to his father 's power . ”
110064	110149	110054	110054	he	3390	“ Hark unto me , O son of Aeacus ! and you shall have the bride your heart desires : when she at rest lies sleeping in the cool wave , you must bind her while she is unwary , with strong cords and complicated bonds , And never let her arts deceive you when she imitates a hundred varied forms , but hold her fast , whatever she may seem , until she shall at length assume the shape she had at first . ”
110257	110276	110252	110252	she	5026	“ You could not overcome me in this way , but some divinity has given you the power . ”
110525	110601	110516	110519	The king of Trachyn	3411	“ Ah , Peleus , even the lowest ranks enjoy our bounties and our hospitality , and you bring with you powers which compell attention and respect . Your name is so illustrious , and is not Jupiter your grandsire ? Do not lose your time by such entreaties . Everything you may desire is yours as soon as known , and all you see is partly yours , but in how sad a state ! ”
110622	110797	110619	110619	he	872	“ Perchance you deem that bird which lives on prey , which is the terror of all other birds , had always feathered wings ? It was a man . And now the vigor of its courage is as great as when well known by his man 's name , Daedalion , bold in wars and strong and harsh , and not afraid to hazard violence . His father was unequalled Lucifer , star of the Morning , who at dawn brings forth Aurora , and withdraws the last of all the shining stars of heaven . — My brother named daedalion , son of that great star , was fond of cruel warfare , while I cherished peace and loved the quiet of my married life . This brother , powerful in the art of war , subdued strong kings and nations . — And ' tis he transformed from manhood , now a bird of prey , that so relentlessly pursues the doves , known as the pride of Thisbe 's citizens . “
110945	111004	110938	110938	he	549	“ When her mature womb had completed time Autolycus was born , a crafty son , who certainly inherited the skill of wingfoot Mereury , his artful sire , notorious now ; for every kind of theft . In fact , Autolycus with Mercury 's craft , loved to make white of black , and black of white . “
111045	111100	111039	111039	his	1025	“ What benefit in life did she obtain because she pleased ! two gods and bore such twins ? Was she blest by good fortune then because she was the daughter of a valiant father , and even the grandchild of the Morning Star ? Can glory be a curse ? Often it is . “
111158	111212	111214	111214	her	1024	“ Without delay Diana bent her bow , and from the string an arrow swiftly flew , and pierced the vaunting tongue of Chione . Her tongue was silenced , and she tried in vain to speak or make a sound , and while she tried her life departed with the flowing blood . “
111259	111368	111244	111244	he	3040	“ Ah ! when he saw her burning , he was filled with such an uncontrolled despair , he rushed four times to leap upon the blazing pyre ; and after he had been four times repulsed , he turned and rushed away in headlong flight through trackless country , as a bullock flees , his swollen neck pierced with sharp hornet - stings , it seemed to me he ran beyond the speed of any human being . You would think his feet had taken wings , he left us far behind and swift in his desire for death he stood at last upon Parnassus ' height . “
111476	111525	111526	111526	Peleus	872	” While Ceyx , the royal son of Lucifer , told these great wonders of his brother 's life ; Onetor , who had watched the while those herds which Peleus had assigned to him , ran up with panting speed ; and cried out as he ran , “
111536	111555	111530	111530	I	0	” Peleus asked him to tell what had gone wrong and with King Ceyx he listened in suspense . “
111565	111570	111556	111556	I	0	” Onetor then began , “
111676	111730	111742	111745	A monster - wolf	3445	“ A sailor , while he dried his nets upon the shore nearby , declared that aged Nereus possessed it with his Nereids , as the gods who ruled the neighboring waters . Very near it is a marsh , made by the encroaching waves , all thickly covered with low willow trees . “
111802	111918	111781	111781	he	3445	“ He never paused to sate his ravenous hunger with the first cattle that he fell upon , but mangled the whole herd , as if at war . And some of us , while we defended them , were wounded with his fatal bite and killed . — the shore and nearest waves were red with blood , and marshy fens were filled with mournful sounds — the longings of our cattle . — This delay is dangerous . We must not hesitate . We must unite before all is destroyed ! Take up your arms . Arm ! and unite , I say ! And bear our weapons for the cause of Right ! ”
112079	112130	112077	112077	Peleus	872	“ O queen , ' Tis sweet and commendable in you to fear but needless . Though you promise generous aid , my hope lies not in fighting with the beast , I must appease a goddess of the sea . And the divinity of ocean must be properly adored . ”
112514	112635	112510	112510	she	3472	“ What fault of mine , my dearest , has so changed your usual thoughts ? Where is that care for me that always has stood first ? Can you leave me for this long journey with no anxious fear — Halcyone , forsaken in these halls ? Will this long journey be a pleasant change because far from you I should be more dear ? Perhaps you think you will go there by land , and I shall only grieve , and shall not fear the sea affrights me with its tragic face . Just lately I observed some broken planks upon our seashore , and I 've read and read the names of seamen on their empty tombs ! “
112758	112831	112837	112840	the daughter of Aeolus	3483	“ But , O dear husband ! if this new resolve can not be altered by my prayers and fears , and if you are determined , take me , too : some comfort may be gained , if in the storms we may be tossed together . I shall fear only the ills that really come to us , together we can certainly endure discomforts till we gain that distant land . ”
112913	112966	112910	112910	he	1020	“ This separation from your love will be most sorrowful ; and so I swear to you , as witnessed by the sacred fire of my Star - father , if the fates permit my safe return , I will come back to you before the moon has rounded twice her orb . ”
113034	113039	113007	113007	Halcyone	1030	“ Ah — Farewell ! ”
113331	113348	113350	113350	He	3498	“ Lower the top sails — quick — furl all the sails tight to the yards ! ”
114437	114440	114428	114428	his	1020	“ Halcyone ! ”
114709	114756	114704	114704	Juno	488	“ O , Iris , best of all my messengers , go quickly to the dreadful court of Sleep , and in my name command him to despatch a dream in the shape of Ceyx , who is dead , and tell Halcyone the woeful truth . ”
115250	115326	115246	115246	She	471	“ O , Sleep , divine repose of all things ! Gentlest of the deities ! Peace to the troubled mind , from which you drive the cares of life , restorer of men 's strength when wearied with the toils of day , command a vision that shall seem the actual form of royal Ceyx to visit Trachin famed for Hercules and tell Halcyone his death by shipwreck . It is Juno 's wish . ”
115746	115929	115741	115741	he	5496	“ Most wretched wife , can you still recognize your own loved Ceyx , or have my looks changed : so much with death you can not ? — Look at me , and you will be assured I am your own : but here instead of your dear husband , you will find only his ghost . Your faithful prayers did not avail , Halcyone , and I have perished . Give up all deluding hopes of my return . The stormy Southwind caught my ship while sailing the Aegean sea ; and there , tossed by the mighty wind , my ship was dashed to pieces . While I vainly called upon your name , the angry waters closed above my drowning head and it is no uncertain messenger that tells you this and nothing from vague rumors has been told . But it is I myself , come from the wreck , now telling you my fate . Come then , arise shed tears , and put on mourning ; do not send me unlamented , down to Tartarus . ”
116003	116023	115998	115998	she	1030	“ Stay , oh stay with me ! Why do you hurry from me ? We will go together ! ”
116143	116289	116140	116140	she	1030	“ Alas , Halcyone is no more ! no more ! with her own Ceyx she is dead ! is dead ! Away with words of comfort , he is lost by shipwreck ! I have seen him , and I knew him surely — as a ghost he came to me ; and when desirous to detain him , I stretched forth my arms to him , his ghost left me — it vanished from me ; but it surely was the ghost of my dead husband . If you ask description of it , I must truly say he did not have his well known features — he was not so cheerful as he was in life ! Alas , I saw him pale and naked , with his hair still dripping — his ghost from the waves stood on this very spot : ”
116302	116417	116294	116294	she	3628	“ Alas , this was my fear , and this is what my mind shuddered to think of , when I begged that you would not desert me for the wind 's control . But how I wish , since you were sailing forth to perish , that you had but taken me with you . If I had gone with you , it would have been advantage to me , for I should have shared the whole course of my life with you and you would not have met a separate death . I linger here but I have met my death , I toss on waves , and drift upon the sea . “
116500	116561	116562	116562	He	3632	”Overcome with grief , she could not say another word — but she continued wailing , and her groans were heaved up from her sorrow - stricken breast . At early dawn , she went from her abode down to the seashore , where most wretchedly , she stood upon the spot from which he sailed , and sadly said ; “
116585	116698	116573	116573	he	3632	” And while she called to recollection all that she had seen when standing there , and while she looked far out on flowing waves from there , she noticed floating on the distant sea — what shall I say ? At first even she could not be sure of what she saw . But presently although still distant — it was certainly a floating corpse . She could not see what man he might be , but because it seemed to her it surely was a shipwrecked body , she was moved as at an omen and began to weep ; and , moaning as she stood there , said : — “
116719	116769	116772	116772	he	3638	” As driven by the waves the body came still nearer to her , she was less and less the mistress of herself , the more she looked upon it ; and , when it was close enough for her to see its features , she beheld her husband . “
116774	116801	116772	116772	he	3638	” she cried and then she tore her face , her hair , her royal robe and then , extending both her trembling hands towards Ceyx , “
116814	116818	116808	116808	you	3636	” She cried , “
116823	117111	116808	116808	you	3636	” A mole , made by the craft of man , adjoins the sea and breaks the shoreward rush of waves . To this she leaped — it seemed impossible — and then , while beating the light air with wings that instant formed upon her , she flew on , a mourning bird , and skimmed above the waves . And while she lightly flew across the sea her clacking mouth with its long slender bill , full of complaining , uttered moaning sounds : but when she touched the still and pallied form , embracing his dear limbs with her new wings , she gave cold kisses with her hardened bill . All those who saw it doubted whether Ceyx could feel her kisses ; and it seemed to them the moving waves had raised his countenance . But he was truly conscious of her grief ; and through the pity of the gods above , at last they both were changed to flying birds , together in their fate . Their love lived on , nor in these birds were marriage bonds dissolved , and they soon coupled and were parent birds . Each winter during seven full days of calm Halcyone broods on her floating nest — her nest that sails upon a halcyon sea : the passage of the deep is free from storms , throughout those seven full days ; and Aeolus restraining harmful winds , within their cave , for his descendants ' sake gives halcyon seas . An old man saw the two birds fly across the wide extended sea and praised their love , undying to the end . His old friend who stood near him , said , “
117131	117152	116808	116808	you	3636	” and as he spoke , he pointed at a divedapper , which had a long throat , and continued , “
117209	117283	117284	117284	He	3645	“ Aesacus was the brother of the great illustrious Hector ; and , if he had not been victimized by a strange fate in youth , he would have equalled Hector 's glorious fame , Hector was child of Hecuba , who was daughter of Dymas . Alexirhoe , the daughter of the two - horned Granicus , so rumor has it , secretly brought forth Aesacus , hidden under Ida 's shade . “
117363	117473	117478	117478	he	1037	“ Just when he saw her , while she rested there , her hair spread on her shoulders to the sun , she saw him , and without delay she fled , even as the frightened deer runs from the wolf or as the water - duck , when she has left her favored stream , surprised , flies from the hawk . Aesacus followed her , as swift with love as she was swift with fear . But in the grass a lurking snake struck at her rosy heel and left its venom in her flesh . — And so , her flight was ended by untimely death . “
117553	117554	117555	117555	He	1037	” “
117582	117655	117657	117657	he	1037	“ Tethys was moved with pity for his fall , received him softly , and then covered him with feathers , as he swam among the waves . The death he sought for was not granted him . At this the lover was wroth . Against his will , he was obliged to live in his distress , with opposition to his spirit that desired departure from the wretched pain of life . “
117999	118033	117990	117990	Calchas	1043	“ Rejoice Pelasgian men , for we shall conquer ; Troy will fall ; although the toil of war must long continue — so the nine birds equal nine long years of war . ”
118805	118827	118802	118802	he	1048	“ Whoever you may be , you have the consolation of a glorious death you die by me , Haemonian Achilles ! ”
118869	118883	118884	118885	The other	5036	“ By report we knew of you before this battle , goddess born . ”
118889	118902	118884	118885	The other	5036	“ But why are you surprised that I escape the threatened wound ? ”
118909	119000	119003	119003	he	1048	“ This helmet crowned , great with its tawny horse - hair , and this shield , broad - hollowed , on my left arm , are not held for help in war : they are but ornament , as Mars wears armor . All of them shall be put off , and I will fight with you unhurt . It is a privilege that I was born not as you , of a Nereid but of him whose powerful rule is over Nereus , his daughters and their ocean . ”
119164	119170	119171	119171	he	1048	“ My hand is weak , ”
119174	119283	119171	119171	he	1048	“ but is it possible its strength forsook me though it never has before ? For surely I had my accustomed strength , when first I overthrew Lyrnessus ' walls , or when I won the isle of Tenedos or Thebes ( then under King Eetion ) and I drenched both with their own peoples ' blood , or when the river Caycus ran red with slaughter of its people , or , when twice Telephus felt the virtue of my spear . On this field also , where such heaps lie slain , my right hand surely has proved its true might ; and it is mighty . ”
119357	119398	119335	119335	he	1048	“ This is the hand , and this the spear I conquered with ; and I will use the same against him who in luck escaped their power ; and the result should favor as I pray the helpful gods . ”
119977	120053	119972	119972	Nestor	911	“ During your time , Cygnus has been the only man you knew who could despise all weapons and whose flesh could not be pierced by thrust of sword or spear . But long ago I saw another man able to bear unharmed a thousand strokes , Caeneus of Thessaly , Caeneus who lived upon Mt. Othrys . He was famed in war yet , strange to say , by birth he was a woman ! ”
120074	120131	120071	120071	Achilles	1048	“ O eloquent old man ! The wisdom of our age ! All of us wish to hear , who was this Caeneus ? Why was he changed to the other sex ? in what campaigns , and in what wars was he so known to you ? Who conquered him , if any ever did ? ”
120142	120205	120132	120134	The aged man	3759	“ Although my great age is a harm to me , and many actions of my early days escape my memory ; yet , most of them are well remembered . Nothing of old days , amid so many deeds of war and peace , can be more firmly fixed upon my mind than the strange story I shall tell of him . “
120314	120529	120530	120534	The son of bold Ixion	3768	“ Caenis never became the willing bride of any suitor ; but report declares , while she was walking on a lonely shore , the god of ocean saw and ravished her . And in the joy of that love Neptune said , ‘ Request of me whatever you desire , and nothing shall deny your dearest wish ! ’ — the story tells us that he made this pledge . And Caenis said to Neptune , ‘ The great wrong , which I have suffered from you justifies the wonderful request that I must make ; I ask that I may never suffer such an injury again . Grant I may be no longer woman , and I 'll ask no more . ’ while she was speaking to him , the last words of her strange prayer were uttered in so deep , in such a manly tone , it seemed indeed they must be from a man . — That was a fact : Neptune not only had allowed her prayer but made the new man proof against all wounds of spear or sword . Rejoicing in the gift he went his way as Caeneus Atracides , spent years in every manful exercise , and roamed the plains of northern Thessaly . “
120628	120772	120619	120619	she	5425	“ And so Pirithous , the fortunate son , of bold Ixion , was so praised by all , for his pure joy and lovely wife , it seemed his very blessings must have led to fatal harm : for savage Eurytus , wildest of the wild centaurs , now inflamed with sudden envy , drunkenness , and lust , upset the tables and made havoc there so dreadful , that the banquet suddenly was changed from love to uproar . Seized by the hair , the bride was violently dragged away . When Eurytus caught up Hippodame each one of all the centaurs took at will the maid or matron that he longed for most . The palace , seeming like a captured town , resounded with affrighted shrieks of women . At once we all sprang up . And Theseus cried , “
121156	121538	121539	121539	Victorious	1069	“ Gryneus , seeing a smoking altar , cried , ‘ Good use for this , ’ with which words he raised up that heavy , blazing altar . Hurling it into the middle of the Lapithae , he struck down Broteas and Orius : Mycale , mother of that Orius , was famous for her incantations , which she had often used to conjure down the shining twin - horns of the unwilling moon . Exadius threatened , ‘ You shall not escape ! Let me but have a weapon ! ’ And with that , he whirled the antlers of a votive stag , which he found there , hung on a tall pine - tree ; and with that double - branching horn he pierced the eyes of Gryneus , and he gouged them out . One eye stuck to the horn ; the other rolled down on his beard , to which it strictly clung in dreadful clotted gore . Then Rhoetus snatched a blazing brand of plum - wood from an altar and whirling it upon the right , smashed through the temples of Charaxus , wonderful with golden hair . Seized by the violent flames , his yellow locks burned fiercely , as a field of autumn grain ; and even the scorching blood gave from the sore wound a terrific noise as a red - hot iron in pincers which the smith lifts out and plunges in the tepid pool , hissing and sizzling . Charaxus shook the fire from his burnt locks ; and heaved up on his shoulders a large threshold stone torn from the ground — a weight sufficient for a team of oxen . The vast weight impeded him , so that it could not even touch his foe — and yet , the massive stone did hit his friend , Cometes , who was standing near to him , and crushed him down . Then Rhoetus , crazed with joy , exulting yelled , ‘ I pray that all of you may be so strong ! ’ Wielding his half - burnt stake with heavy blows again and again , he broke the sutures of his enemy 's skull , until the bones were mingled with his oozing brains . “
121671	121878	121657	121657	Dryas	700	“ Rhoetus groaned and with a great effort pulled the stake out from the bone , then fled away , drenched in his blood . And Orneus followed him . Lycabas fled , and Medon with a wound in his right shoulder . Thaumas and Pisenor and Mermerus fled with them . Mermerus , who used to excell all others in a race , ran slowly , crippled by a recent wound . Pholus and Melaneus ran for their lives and with them Abas , hunter of wild boars and Asbolus , the augur , who in vain had urged his friends to shun that hapless fight . As Nessus joined the rout , he said to him , ‘ You need not flee , for you shall be reserved a victim for the bow of Hercules ! ’ but neither Lycidas , Eurynomus nor Areos , nor Imbreus had escaped from death : for all of these the strong right hand of Dryas pierced , as they confronted him . Crenaeus there received a wound in front . Although he turned in flight , as he looked back , a heavy javelin between his eyes pierced through him , where his nose and forehead joined . “
122045	122123	122124	122124	They	3794	“ I saw Petraeus when he strove to tear up from the earth , an acorn - bearing oak . And , while he struggled with it , back and forth , and was just ready to wrench up the trunk , Pirithous hurled a well aimed spear at him , transfixed his ribs , and pinned his body tight , writhing , to that hard oak : and Lycus fell and Chromis fell , before Pirithous . “
122216	122523	122535	122535	he	872	“ Aphareus , eager to avenge him tried to lift a rock from that steep mountain side ; but as he heaved , the son of Aegeus struck him squarely with an oaken club ; and smashed , and broke the huge bones of that centaur 's arm . He has no time , and does not want to give that useless foe to death . He leaps upon the back of tall Bienor , never trained to carry riders , and he fixed his knees firm in the centaur 's ribs , and holding tight to the long hair , seized by his left hand , struck and shattered the hard features and fierce face and bony temples with his club of gnarled strong oak . And with it , he struck to the ground Nedymnus and Lycopes , dart expert , and Hippasus , whose beard hid all his breast . And Rhipheus taller than the highest trees and Thereus , who would carry home alive the raging bears , caught in Thessalian hills . Demoleon could no longer stand and look on Theseus and his unrestrained success . He struggled with vast effort to tear up an old pine , trunk and all , with its long roots , and , failing shortly in that first attempt , he broke it off and hurled it at his foe . But Theseus saw the pine tree in its flight and , warned by Pallas , got beyond its range — his boast was , Pallas had directed him ! And yet , the missle was not launched in vain . It sheared the left shoulder and the breast from tall Crantor . He , Achilles , was your father 's armor bearer and was given by King Amyntor , when he sued for peace . “
122733	122862	122712	122712	he	872	“ To him I said , for courage gave me strength , ‘ Your horns ! how much inferior to my steel ! ’ — and threw my spear . Since he could not avoid the gleaming point , he held up his right hand to shield his forehead from the threatened wound . His hand was pierced and pinned against his forehead . He shouted madly . Peleus , near him while he stood there pinned and helpless with his wound , struck him with sharp sword in the belly deep . He leaped forth fiercely , as he trailed his bowels upon the ground , with his entangled legs treading upon them , bursting them , he fell with empty belly , lifeless to the earth . “
123172	123356	123154	123154	She	1093	“ Their love was equal , and together they would wander over mountain - sides , and rest together in cool caves ; and so it was , they went together to that palace - cave , known to the Lapithae . Together they fought fiercely in this battle , side by side . Thrown by an unknown hand , a javelin pierced Cyllarus , just below the fatal spot where the chest rises to the neck — his heart , though only slightly wounded , grew quite cold , and his whole body felt cold , afterwards , as quickly as the weapon was drawn out . Then Hylonome held in her embrace the dying body ; fondled the dread wound and , fixing her lips closely to his lips endeavored to hold back his dying breath . But soon she saw that he indeed was dead . With mourning words , which clamor of the fight prevented me from hearing , she threw herself on the spear that pierced her Cyllarus and fell upon his breast , embracing him in death . “
123559	123743	123746	123748	the centaurs Caeneus	3822	“ Those were my days of youth and strength , and then I ought to have warred against the citadel of Pergama . I could have checked , or even vanquished , the arms of Hector : but , alas , Hector had not been born , or was perhaps a boy . Old age has dulled my youthful strength . What use is it , to speak of Periphas , who overcame Pyretus , double - formed ? Why tell of Ampyx , who with pointless shaft , victorious thrust Echeclus through the face ? Macareus , hurling a heavy crowbar pierced Erigdupus and laid him low . A hunting spear that Nessus strongly hurled , was buried in the groin of Cymelus . Do not believe that Mopsus , son of Ampycus , was merely a prophet of events to come , he slew a daring two - formed monster there . Hodites tried in vain to speak , before his death , but could not , for his tongue was nailed against his chin , his chin against his throat . “
123867	123954	123849	123849	he	3824	“ ‘ Shall I put up with one like you , O Caeneus ? For you are still a woman in my sight . Have you forgot your birth or that disgrace by which you won reward — at what a price you got the false resemblance to a man ? ! Consider both your birth , and what you have submitted to ! Take up a distaff , and wool basket ! Twist your threads with practiced thumb ! Leave warfare to your men ! ’ “
123988	124130	123966	123966	Caeneus	904	“ The Centaur , Latreus , raved with pain and struck with his great pike , the face of Caeneus . His pike rebounded as the hail that slants up from the roof ; or as a pebble might rebound from hollow drum . Then coming near , he tried to drive a sword into the hard side of Caeneus , but it could not make a wound . ‘ Aha ! ’ he cried , ‘ this will not get you off . The good edge of my sword will take your life , although the point is blunt ! ’ He turned the edge against the flank of Caeneus and swung round the hero 's loins with his long , curving arm . The flesh resounded like a marble block , the keen blade shattered on the unyielding skin . “
124208	124255	124183	124183	he	1112	“ Then , quite beside themselves , the double - natured monsters rushed against that single - handed youth with huge uproar , and thrust and hurled their weapons all at him . Their blunted weapons fell and he remained unharmed and without even a mark . ”
124256	124452	124461	124461	he	3829	“ That strange sight left them speechless . ‘ Oh what shame ! ’ at length cried Monychus , ‘ Our mighty host , — a nation of us , are defeated and defied by one who hardly is a man . Although indeed , he is a man , and we have proved , by our weak actions , we are certainly what he was ! Shame on us ! Oh , what if we have twofold strength , of what avail our huge and mighty limbs , doubly united in the strongest , hugest bodies in this world ? And how can I believe that we were born of any goddess ? It is surely vain to claim descent of great Ixion , who high - souled , sought Juno for his mighty mate ; imagine it , while we are conquered by an enemy , who is but half a man ! Wake up ! and let us heap tree - trunks and stones and mountains on him ! Crush his stubborn life ! Let forests smother him to death ! Their weight will be as deadly as a hundred wounds ! ’ “
124584	124648	124559	124559	he	904	“ What happened to him could not well be known . Some thought his body was borne down by weight into the vast expanse of Tartarus . The son of Ampycus did not agree , for from the middle of the pile we saw a bird with golden wings mount high in air . Before or since , I never saw the like . “
124707	124752	124753	124753	Nestor	911	“ Our grief increased resentment , and we bore it with disgust that one was overwhelmed by such a multitude . Then in revenge we plied our swords , till half our foes were dead , and only flight and darkness saved the rest . ”
124794	124832	124833	124833	Nestor	911	“ Old sir , it is very strange , you have neglected to say one good word in praise of Hercules . My father told me often , that he overcame in battle those cloud born centaurs . ”
124840	124992	124833	124833	Nestor	911	“ Why force me to recall old wrongs , to uncover sorrow buried by the years , that made me hate your father ? It is true his deeds were wonderful beyond belief , heaven knows , and filled the earth with well earned praise which I should rather wish might be denied . Deiphobus , the wise Polydamas , and even great Hector get no praise from me . Your father , I recall once overthrew Messene 's walls and with no cause destroyed Elis and Pylos and with fire and sword ruined my own loved home . I can not name all whom he killed . But there were twelve of us , the sons of Neleus and all warrior youths , and all those twelve but me alone he killed . Ten of them met the common fate of war , but sadder was the death of Periclymenus . “
125189	125232	125236	125236	his	911	“ O noble leader of the Rhodian fleet , why should I sing the praise of Hercules ? But for my brothers I take no revenge except withholding praise of his great deeds . With you , my friendship will remain secure . ”
125335	125397	125324	125324	he	472	“ O nephew the most dear to me of all my brother 's sons , with me you built in vain the walls of Troy : you must be lost in grief , when you look on those towers so soon to fall ? Or do you not lament the multitudes slain in defence of them — To name but one : “
125482	125547	125474	125474	you	3849	” The Delian god , Apollo , gave assent , both for his own hate and his uncle 's rage . Veiled in a cloud , he found the Trojan host and , there , while bloody strife went on , he saw the hero Paris shoot at intervals his arrows at the nameless host of Greeks . Revealing his divinity , he said : “
125582	125958	125959	125959	We	3857	” He pointed out Achilles — laying low the Trojan warriors with his mighty spear . On him he turned the Trojan 's willing bow and guided with his hand the fatal shaft . It was the first joy that old Priam knew since Hector 's death . So then Achilles you , who overcame the mighty , were subdued by a coward who seduced a Grecian wife ! Ah , if you could not die by manly hands , your choice had been the axe . Now that great terror of the Trojan race , the glory and defence of the Pelasgians , Achilles , first in war , lay on the pyre . The god of Fire first armed , then burned , his limbs . And now he is but ashes ; and of him , so great , renowned and mighty , but a pitiful handful of small dust insufficient for a little urn ! But all his glory lives enough to fill the world — a great reward . And in that glory is his real life : in a true sense he will never know the void of Tartarus . But soon his very shield — that men might know to whom it had belonged — brings war , and arms are taken for his arms . Neither Diomed nor Ajax called the less ventured to claim the hero 's mighty shield . Menelaus and other warlike chiefs , even Agamemnon , all withdrew their claims . Only the greater Ajax and Ulysses had such assurance that they dared contest for that great prize . Then Agamemnon chose to avoid the odium of preferring one . He bade the Argolic chieftains take their seats within the camp and left to all of them the hearing and decision of the cause . The chiefs were seated , and the soldiers form a circle round them . Then Ajax , the approved lord of the seven - fold shield , arose and spoke . Impatient in his wrath , he looked with stern , set features , out over Sigaean shores , and over the fleet of ships upon the beach , and , stretching out his hands , he said , “
126137	126297	126124	126124	He	1126	“ I , even if my merit were in doubt should still excell in birth . I am the son of Telamon , who with great Hercules brought low the power of Troy and in the ship of Jason voyaged even to the Colchian shores . His father , Aeacus , now is a judge among the silent shades — where Sisyphus toils and is mocked forever with the stone . Great Jove himself calls Aeacus his son . Thus , Ajax is the third from Jupiter . But , Greeks , let not this line of my descent avail me , if I do not share it with my cousin , great Achilles . I demand these arms now due me as a cousin . Why should this one , from the blood of Sisyphus , and like him for his thefts and frauds , intrude the names of that loathed family upon honored descendants of brave Aeacus ? “
126407	126571	126574	126574	he	3874	“ Would that his madness had been real , or had been accepted as reality and that he never had attended us , as our companion to the Phrygian towers , this counsellor of evil ! Then , good son of Poeas , Lemnos would not hold you now , exposed through guilt of ours ! You , as men say , hidden in forest lairs , are moving with your groans the very rocks and asking for Ulysses what he so well deserves — what , if indeed there still are gods , you shall not ask in vain . And now , one of our leaders , he that was sworn to the same arms with ourselves ! by whom the arrows of great Hercules are used , as his successor ; broken by disease and famine , clothed with feathers , now must feed on birds and squander for his wretched fare the arrows destined for the wreck of Troy . “
126692	126797	126798	126800	The gods above	3606	“ Should he excel the faithful Nestor by his eloquence , I 'd yet be well convinced the way he forsook Nestor was a crime , old Nestor , who implored in vain his aid , when he was hindered by his wounded steed and wearied with the years of his old age , was then deserted by that scheming man . The charge that I have made is strictly true , and the son of Tydeus knows it all too well ; for he at that time called him by his name , rebuked him and upbraided his weak friend for coward flight . “
126968	127093	126947	126947	he	3880	“ Hector approached , and brought the gods with him to battle ; and , wherever he rushed on , not only this Ulysses was alarmed , but even the valiant , for so great the fear he caused them . Hector , proud in his success in blood and slaughter , I then dared to meet and with a huge : stone from a distance hurled I laid him flat . When he demanded one to fight with , I engaged him quite alone , for you my Greek friends , prayed the lot might fall upon me , and your prayers prevailed . If you should ask me of this fight , I will declare I was not vanquished there by him . “
127238	127337	127236	127236	Diomed	1125	“ Why give arms to Ulysses , who by stealth and quite unarmed , has always done his work , deceiving his unwary enemy by stratagems ? This brilliant helmet , rich with sparkling gold , will certainly betray his plans , and will discover him when hid . His soft Dulichian head beneath the helm of great Achilles will not bear the weight ; Achilles ' heavy spear from Pelion must be burdensome for his unwarlike hands : nor will the shield , graven with the vasty world beseem a dastard left hand , smooth for theft . “
127443	127495	127496	127496	Ajax	1126	“ In short , what need is there for words ? Let us be tried in war . Let all the arms of brave Achilles now be thrown among the foe ; order them all to be retrieved ; and decorate for war whoever brings them back , a worthy prize . ”
127566	127738	127545	127545	his	1126	“ If my desire and yours could have prevailed , O noble Greeks , the man who should receive a prize so valued , would not be in doubt , and you would now enjoy your arms , and we enjoy you , great Achilles . Since unjust fate has denied him both to me and you , ( and here he wiped his eyes dry with his hands , as though then shedding tears , ) who could succeed the great Achilles better than the one through whom the great Achilles joined the Greeks ? Let Ajax win no votes because he seems to be as stupid as the truth declares . Let not my talents , which were always used for service of the Greeks , increase my harm : and let this eloquence of mine ( if such we call it ) which is pleading now for me , as it has pleaded many times for you , awake no envy . Let each man show his best . “
127849	127930	127833	127833	Mercury	492	“ But not because my mother 's line is better and not because my father certainly , is innocent of his own brother 's blood , have I advanced my claim to own those arms . Let personal merit weigh the cause alone . Let Ajax win no credit from the fact that Telamon , was brother unto Peleus . Let not his merit be that he is near by blood , may honor of manhood weigh in your award ! “
128001	128031	128032	128032	Achilles	1048	“ Since then the contest lies in deeds alone , though I have done more than may be well told , I will recall them as they have occurred . “
128295	128493	128283	128283	I	0	“ After the grief of one had reached all Greece , and ships a thousand , filled Euboean Aulis ; the breezes long expected would not blow or adverse held the helpless fleet ashore . Then ruthless oracles gave their command , that Agamemnon should make sacrifice of his loved daughter and so satisfy Diana 's cruel heart . The father stood up resolute , enraged against the gods , a parent even though a king . I turned , by tactful ! words , a father 's tender heart to the great issue of the public weal . I will confess it , and when I have confessed , may the son of Atreus pardon : I had to plead a difficult case before a partial judge . The people 's good , his brother 's , and stern duty , that followed his great office , won his ear , till royal honor outweighed claims of blood . I sought the mother , who could not be won by pleading but must be deceived by craft . Had Ajax gone to her , our thousand sails would still droop , waiting for the favoring breeze . “
128615	128641	128597	128597	Menelaus	1127	“ I need not linger over the many things which by my counsel and my bravery I have accomplished through this long - drawn war . “
128761	128932	128753	128753	I	0	“ Then , at the wish of Jove , our king , deceive by A false dream , bids us give up the war — he could excuse his order by the cause . Let Ajax tell him Troy must be laid low or let him fight — at least he can do that ! Why does he fail to stop the fugitives ? Why not take arms and tell the wavering crowd to rally round him ? Would that be too much for one who never speaks except to boast ? But now words fail me : Ajax turns and flees ! I witnessed it and was ashamed to see you turn disgraced , preparing sails for flight . With exclamations and without delay , I said , ‘ What are you doing ? O my friends , has madness seized you that you will quit Troy , which is as good as taken ? What can you bear home , after ten years , but your disgrace ? ’ “
129049	129112	129039	129039	I	0	“ Which of the noble Greeks has given you praise or sought your company ? Yet Diomed has shared his deeds with me and praises me , and , while Ulysses is with him , is brave and confident . ' Tis worthy of regard , when out of many thousands of the Greeks , a man becomes the choice of Diomed ! “
129183	129293	129179	129179	Troy	1143	“ Of such things now , I had discovered all that should be found out , and I might have then returned to enjoy the praise I had deserved . But not content with that , I sought the tent of Rhesus , and within his camp I slew him and his proved attendants . Having thus gained as a conqueror my own desires , I drove back in a captured chariot , — a joyous triumph . Well , deny me , then . The arms of him whose steeds the enemy demanded as the price of one night 's aid . Ajax himself has been more generous . “
129396	129408	129392	129392	yourselves	3958	” Then with one hand , he drew his robe aside . “
129414	129418	129392	129392	yourselves	3958	” he cried , “
129452	129552	129564	129564	he	3962	“ What does it prove , if he declares that he fought for our ships against both Troy and Jove ? I grant he did , for it is not my wo nt with malice to belittle other 's deeds . But let him not claim for himself alone an honor in which all may have a share , let him concede some credit due to you . Disguised within the fear inspiring arms of great Achilles , Actor 's son drove back the host of Trojans from our threatened fleet or ships and Ajax would have burned together . “
129610	129833	129836	129836	his	3964	“ Ah , bitter fate , with how much grief I am compelled to recollect the time , when brave Achilles , bulwark of the Greeks , was slain . Nor tears , nor grief , nor fear , could hinder me : I carried his dead body from the ground , uplifted on these shoulders , I repeat , upon these shoulders from that ground I bore off dead Achilles , and those arms which now I want to bear away again . I have the strength to walk beneath their weight , I have a mind to understand their worth . Did the hero 's mother , goddess of the sea , win for her son these arms , made by a god , a work of wondrous art , to have them clothe a rude soldier , who has no mind at all ? He never could be made to understand the rich engravings , pictured on the shield — the ocean , earth , and stars in lofty skies ; the Pleiades , and Hyades , the Bear , which touches not the ocean , far beyond the varied planets , and the fire - bright sword of high Orion . He demands a prize , which , if he had it , would be lost on him . “
129978	130084	129976	129976	Ajax	1126	“ It is no wonder that he pours on me reproaches of his silly tongue , because he charges you with what is worthy shame . Am I depraved because this Palamedes has improperly been charged with crime by me ? Then was it honorable for all of you , if you condemned him ? Only think , that he , the son of Naplius , made no defence against the crime , so great , so manifest : nor did you only hear the charges brought against him , but you saw the proof yourselves , and in the gold his villainy was shown . “
130280	130417	130276	130276	Ajax	1126	“ Though , Philoctetes , you should be enraged against your friends , against the king and me ; although you curse and everlastingly devote my head to harm ; although you wish , to ease your anguish , that I may be given into your power , that you may shed my blood ; and though you wait your turn and chance at me ; still I will undertake the quest and will try all my skill to bring you back with me . If my good fortune then will favor me , I shall obtain your arrows ; as I made the Trojan seer my captive , as I learned the heavenly oracles and fate of Troy , and as I brought back through a host of foes Minerva 's image from the citadel . “
130564	130624	130557	130557	I	0	“ Stop hinting by your look and muttered words that Diomed was my partner in the deed . The praise he won is his . You , certainly fought not alone , when you held up your shield to save the allied fleet : a multitude was with you , but a single man gave me his valued help . “
130731	130850	130714	130717	All these brave men	3994	“ Your right hand is valuable in war , your temper stands in need of my direction . You have strength without intelligence ; I look out for the future . You are able in the fight ; I help our king to find the proper time . Your body may give service , and my mind must point the way : and just as much as he who guides the ship must be superior to him who rows it ; and we all agree the general is greater than the soldier ; so , do I excel you . In the body lives an intellect much rarer than a hand , by that we measure human excellence . “
130978	131070	131080	131080	Ulysses	1129	” And he pointed to Minerva 's fateful head . The assembled body of the chiefs was moved ; and then , appeared the power of eloquence : the fluent man received , amid applause , the arms of the brave man . His rival , who so often when alone , stood firm against great Hector and the sword , and flames and Jove , stood not against a single passion , wrath . The unconquerable was conquered by his grief . He drew his sword , and said : — “
131130	131482	131128	131128	Ajax	1126	” Saying this , he turned toward the vital spot in his own breast , which never had felt a wound , the fated sword and plunged it deeply in . though many sought to aid , no hand had strength to draw that steel — deep driven . The blood itself unaided drove it out . The ensanguined earth sprouted from her green turf that purple flower which grew of old from Hyacinthine blood . Its petals now are charged with double freight — the warrior 's name , Apollo 's cry of woe . The conqueror , Ulysses , now set sail , for Lemnos , country of Hypsipyle , and for the land of Thoas , famed afar , those regions infamous in olden days , where women slew their husbands . So he went that he might capture and bring back with him the arrows of brave Hercules . When these were given back to the Greeks , their lord with them , a final hand at last prevailed to end that long fought war . Both Troy and Priam fell , and Priam 's wretched wife lost all she had , until at last she lost her human form . Her savage barkings frightened foreign lands , where the long Hellespont is narrowed down . Great Troy was burning : while the fire still raged , Jove 's altar drank old Priam 's scanty blood . The priestess of Apollo then , alas ! Was dragged by her long hair , while up towards heaven she lifted supplicating hands in vain . The Trojan matrons , clinging while they could to burning temples and ancestral gods , victorious Greeks drag off as welcome spoil . Astyanax was hurled down from the very tower from which he often had looked forth and seen his father , by his mother pointed out , when Hector fought for honor and his country 's weal . Now Boreas counsels to depart . The sails , moved by a prosperous breeze , resound and wave — the Trojan women cry , — “
131494	131791	131489	131489	we	4003	” and , falling down , they kiss the soil , and leave the smoking roofs of their loved native land . The last to go on board the fleet was Hecuba , a sight most pitiful . She was found among the tombs of her lost sons . While she embraced each urn and fondly kissed their bones , Ulysses came with ruthless hands and bore her off , his prize she in her bosom took away the urn of Hector only , and upon his grave she left some white hair taken from her head , a meager gift , her white hair and her tears . Across the strait from Troy , there is a land claimed by Bistonian men , and in that land was a rich palace , built there by a king named Polymnestor . To him the Phrygian king in secret gave his youngest son to rear , his Polydorus , safe from Troy and war , a prudent course , if he had not sent gold arousing greed , incitement to a crime . Soon , when the fortunes of the Trojans fell , that wicked king of Thrace took his own sword , and pierced the throat of his poor foster son and then , as if the deed could be concealed , if he removed the body , hurled the boy from a wild cliff into the waves below . Until the sea might be more calm , and gales of wind might be subdued , Atrides moored his fleet of ships upon the Thracian shore ; there , from wide gaping earth , Achilles rose , as large as when he lived , with look as fierce , as when his sword once threatened Agamemnon . “
131801	131805	131795	131795	you	4004	” He said , “
131848	131954	131846	131846	Achilles	1048	” Fiercely so he spoke . The old friends of Achilles all obeyed his unforgiving shade ; and instantly the noble and unhappy virgin — brave , more like a man than woman — was torn from her mother 's bosom , cherished more by her , since widowed and alone . And then they led the virgin as a sacrifice from there up to the cruel altar . When the maid observed the savage rites prepared for her , and when she noticed Neoptolemus stand by her with his cruel sword in hand , his fixed eyes on her countenance ; she said : — “
131977	131988	131989	131989	Polyxena	1165	” And then she laid both throat and bosom bare . “
132192	132454	132455	132455	My	0	” After she said these words , the people could no more restrain their tears ; but no one saw her shed one tear . Even the priest himself , reluctantly and weeping , drove the steel into her proffered breast . On failing knees she sank down to the earth ; but still maintained a countenance undaunted to the last : and , even unto death , it was her care to cover all that ought to be concealed , and save the value of chaste modesty . The Trojan matrons took her and recalled , lamenting , all the sons of Priam dead , the wealth of blood one house had shed for all . And they bewailed the chaste Polyxena and you , her mother , only lately called a royal mother and a royal wife , — the soul of Asia 's fair prosperity , ; now lowest fallen in all the wreck of Troy . The conquering Ulysses only claimed her his because she had brought Hector forth : and Hector hardly found a master for his mother . She continued to embrace the body of a soul so brave , and shed her tears , as she had shed them often before for country lost , for sons , for royal mate . She bathed her daughter 's wounds with tears and kissed them with her lips and once more beat her breast . Her white hair streamed down in the clotting blood , she tore her breast , and this and more she said : “
132635	132776	132782	132785	an iron witted wretch	4025	“ But lately on the pinnacle of fame , surrounded by my powerful sons - in - law , daughters , and daughters - in - law , and strong in my great husband , I am exiled now , and destitute , and forced from the sad tombs of those I love , to wretched slavery , serving Penelope : who showing me to curious dames of Ithaca , will point and say , while I am bending to my task , ‘ Look at that woman who was widely known , the mother of great Hector , once the wife of Priam ! ’ After so many have been lost , now you , last comfort of a mother 's grief , must make atonement on the foeman 's tomb . I bore a victim for my enemy . “
132861	132988	132851	132851	He	1036	“ Can I imagine you , a royal maid , will soon be honored with due funeral rites , and will be buried in our family tomb ? Such fortune comes no more to your sad house . A drift of foreign sand will be your grave , the parting gift will be your mother 's tears . We have lost everything ! But no , there is one reason why I should endure a while . His mother 's dearest , now her only child , once youngest of that company of sons , my Polydorus lives here on these shores protected by the friendly Thracian king . Then why delay to bathe these cruel wounds , her dear face spattered with the dreadful blood ? ”
133012	133023	133007	133009	the unhappy mother	4032	“ Give me an urn ; O , Trojan women ! ”
133281	133324	133274	133274	he	4040	“ Oh , Hecuba , you need not wait , give now , munificently to your son — and all you give , and all that you have given , by the good gods , I swear , shall be his own . ”
133683	133879	133660	133660	she	512	“ Beneath all those whom golden heaven sustains ; ( inferior , for see , through all the world my temples are so few ) I have come now a goddess , to you ; not with any hope that you may grant me temples , festivals , and altars , heated with devoted fires : but if you will consider the good deeds , which I , a woman , may yet do for you , when at the dawn I mark the edge of night ; then you may think of some reward for me . But that is not my care ; nor is it now Aurora 's purpose here , that she should plead for honors , though deserved . I come bereaved , of my son Memnon , who in vain bore arms to aid his uncle and in prime of life ( 0 , thus you willed it ! ) fell stricken by the sword of great Achilles . Give my son , I pray , O highest ruler of the gods , some honor , some comfort for his death , a little ease his mother 's grief . ”
134411	134449	134450	134450	Anius	1171	“ O chosen priest of Phoebus , can I be deceived ? When first I saw these walls , did you not have a son , and twice two daughters ? Is it possible I am mistaken ? ”
134463	134541	134450	134450	Anius	1171	“ It can be no mistake , great hero , you did see the father of five children then , ( so much the risk of fortune may affect the best of men ) . You see me now , almost bereft of all . For what assistance can my absent son afford , while he is king , the ruler over Andros — that land named for his name — over which he rules for me ? “
134600	134666	134669	134669	they	2339	“ Soon as Atrides , he who conquered Troy had heard of this ( for you should not suppose that we , too , did not suffer from your storms ) he dragged my daughters there with savage force , from my loved bosom to his hostile camp , and ordered them to feed the Argive fleet , by their divinely given power of touch . “
134755	134866	134720	134720	you	4095	“ Strong chains were brought to hold my daughters ' arms . Both lifted suppliant hands , which still were free , to heaven and cried , ‘ 0 , Father Bacchus ! give us needed aid ! ’ And he who had before given them the power of touch , did give them aid — if giving freedom without human shape can be called giving aid . — I never knew by what means they lost shape , and can not tell ; but their calamity is surely known : my daughters were transformed to snow - white doves , white birds of Venus , guardian of your days . ”
135657	135715	135641	135641	Galatea	1181	“ Truly , O maiden , a gentle race of men courts you , and so you can , and do , refuse all with impunity . But I , whose sire is Nereus , whom the azure Doris bore , though guarded by so many sister nymphs , escaped the Cyclops ' love with tragic loss . ”
135754	135782	135751	135751	she	878	“ Tell me , dear goddess , and do not conceal from me ( for I am true to you ) the cause of your great sorrows . ”
135797	135852	135784	135785	the nymph	5012	“ Acis , the son of Faunus and the nymph Symaethis , was a great delight to his dear father and his mother , but even more to me , for he alone had won my love . Eight birthdays having passed a second time , his tender cheeks were marked with softest down . “
135900	135964	135896	135896	They	4158	“ O gentle Venus ! what power equals yours ! That savage , dreaded by the forest trees , feared by the stranger who beholds his face contemner of Olympus and the gods , now he can feel what love is . He is filled with passion for me . He burns hot for me , forgetful of his cattle and his caves . “
136045	136179	136228	136228	he	4162	“ While all this happened , Telemus arrived at the Sicilian Aetna — Telemus , the son of Eurymus , who never could mistake an omen , met the dreadful fierce , huge Cyclops , Polyphemus , and he said , ‘ That single eye now midmost in your brow Ulysses will take from you . ’ In reply , the Cyclops only laughed at him and said , ‘ Most silly of the prophets ! you are wrong , a maiden has already taken it ! ’ So he made fun of Telemus , who warned him vainly of the truth — and after that , he either burdened with his bulk the shore , by stalking back and forth with lengthy strides , or came back weary to his shaded cave . “
137493	137612	137613	137613	My	0	“ I saw all this ; and , after he in vain had uttered such complaints , he stood up like a raging bull whose heifer has been lost , that can not stand still , but must wander on through brush and forests , that he knows so well : when that fierce monster saw me and my Acis — we neither knew nor guessed our fate — he roared : ‘ I see you and you never will again parade your love before me ! ’ In such a voice as matched his giant size . All Aetna shook and trembled at the noise ; and I amazed with horror , plunged into the adjoining sea . “
137697	138141	138142	138142	I	0	“ Then I did the only thing the Fates permitted me : I let my Acis take ancestral power of river deities . The purple blood flowed from beneath the rock , but soon the sanguine richness faded and became at first the color of a stream , disturbed and muddied by a shower . And presently it clarified . — The rock that had been thrown then split in two , and through the cleft a reed , stately and vigorous , arose to life . And soon the hollow mouth in the great rock , resounded with the waters gushing forth . And wonderful to tell , a youth emerged , the water flowing clear about his waist , his new horns circled with entwining reeds , and the youth certainly was Acis , though he was of larger stature and his face and features all were azure . Acis changed into a stream which ever since that time has flowed there and retained its former name . So Galatea , after she had told her sorrow , ceased ; and , when the company had gone from there , the Nereids swam again in the calm and quiet waves . But Scylla soon returned ( because she did not trust herself in deep salt waters ) and she wandered there naked of garments on the thirsty sand ; but , tired , by chance she found a lonely bay , and cooled her limbs with its enclosing waves . Then suddenly appeared a newly made inhabitant of that deep sea , whose name was Glaucus . Cleaving through the blue sea waves , he swam towards her . His shape had been transformed but lately for this watery life , while he was living at Anthedon in Euboea . — now he is lingering from desire for her he saw there and speaks whatever words he thought might stop her as she fled from him . Yet still she fled from him , and swift through fear , climbed to a mountain top above the sea . Facing the waves , it rose in one huge peak , parting the waters with a forest crown . She stood on that high summit quite secure : and , doubtful whether he might be a god or monster , wondered at his flowing hair which covered his broad shoulders and his back , — and marvelled at the color of his skin and at his waist merged into a twisted fish . All this he noticed , and while leaning there against a rock that stood near by , he said : — “
138189	138378	138187	138187	Athamas	605	“ Not long ago I was a mortal man , yet even then my thought turned to the sea and all my living came from waters deep , for I would drag the nets that swept up fish , or , seated on a rock , I flung the line forth from the rod . The shore I loved was near a verdant meadow . One side were the waves , the other grass , which never had been touched by horned , grazing cattle . Harmless sheep and shaggy goats had never cropped it — no industrious bee came there to harvest flowers ; no festive garlands had been gathered there , adornments of the head ; no mower 's hands had ever cut it . I was certainly the first who ever sat upon that turf , — while I was drying there the dripping nets . And so that I might in due order count the fish that I had caught , I laid out those which by good chance were driven into my nets , or credulous , were caught on my barbed hooks . “
138449	138554	138555	138555	I	0	“ I was amazed and doubtful , a long time ; while I considered what could be the cause . What god had done this ? Or perhaps the juice of some herb caused it ? ‘ But , ’ I said , ‘ what herb can have such properties ? ’ and with my hand I plucked the grass and chewed it with my teeth . My throat had hardly time to swallow those unheard of juices , when I suddenly felt all my entrails throbbing inwardly , and my entire mind also , felt possessed by passions foreign to my life before . “
138672	138800	138659	138659	I	0	“ So far I can relate to you all things most worthy to be told ; for all so far I can remember ; but from that time on I was unconscious of the many things that followed . When my mind returned to me , I found myself entirely different from what I was before ; and my changed mind was not the same as it had always been . Then , for the first time I beheld this beard so green in its deep color , and I saw my flowing hair which now I sweep along the spacious seas , and my huge shoulders with their azure colored arms , and I observed my leg extremities hung tapering exactly perfect as a finny fish . “
138836	139032	139033	139033	You	4222	” While he was telling wonders such as these — quite ready to say more — Scylla arose and left the god . Provoked at his repulse — enraged , he hastened to the marvellous court of Circe , well known daughter of the Sun . Now the Euboean dweller in great waves , Glaucus , had left behind the crest of Aetna , raised upward from a giant 's head ; and left the Cyclops ' fields , that never had been torn by harrow or by plough and never were indebted to the toil of oxen yoked ; left Zancle , also , and the opposite walls of Rhegium , and the sea , abundant cause of shipwreck , which confined with double shores bounds the Ausonian and Sicilian lands . All these behind him , Glaucus , swimming on with his huge hands through those Tyrrhenian seas , drew near the hills so rich in magic herbs and halls of Circe , daughter of the Sun , — halls filled with men in guise of animals . After due salutations had been given — received by her as kindly — Glaucus said , “
139112	139203	139099	139099	I	0	“ It shames me to recount my promises , entreaties , and caresses , and at last rejection of my suit . If you have known a power of incantation , I implore you now repeat that incantation here , with sacred lips — If herbs have greater power , use the tried power of herbs . But I would not request a cure — the healing of this wound . Much better than an end of pain , let her share , and feel with me my impassioned flame . ”
139241	139247	139248	139248	she	1189	“ You might do better , ”
139251	139400	139248	139248	she	1189	“ to court one who is willing , one who wants your love , and feels a like desire . You did deserve to win her love , yes , to be wooed yourself . In fact you might be . If you give some hope , you have my word , you shall indeed be wooed . That you may have no doubt , and so retain all confidence in your attraction 's power — behold ! I am a goddess , and I am the daughter also , of the radiant Sun ! And I who am so potent with my charms , and I who am so potent with my herbs , wish only to be yours . Despise her who despises you , and her who is attached to you repay with like attachment — so by one act offer each her just reward . ”
139409	139440	139402	139402	Glaucus	842	“ The trees will sooner grow in ocean waves , the sea - weed sooner grow on mountain tops , than I shall change my love for graceful ! Scylla . ”
140339	140414	140336	140336	she	4277	“ Much you would have , O man of famous deeds , whose courage is attested by the sword , whose filial piety is proved by flame . But , Trojan , have no fear . I grant your wish , and with my guidance you shall look upon the latest kingdom of the world , shall see Elysian homes and your dear father 's shade , for virtue there is everywhere a way . ”
140539	140546	140547	140547	he	1049	“ Whether you are a deity , ”
140550	140639	140547	140547	he	1049	“ Or human and most favored by the gods , to me you always will appear divine . I will confess , too , my existence here is due to your kind aid , for by your will I visited the dark abodes of death , and I escaped the death which I beheld . For this great service , when I shall emerge into the sunlit air , I will erect for you a temple and will burn for you sweet incense kindled at the altar flame . ”
140649	140655	140656	140656	she	4289	“ I am no goddess , ”
140659	140785	140656	140656	she	4289	“ nor is it well to honor any mortal head with tribute of the holy frankincense . And , that you may not err through ignorance , I tell you life eternal without end was;offered to me , if I would but yield virginity to Phoebus for his love . And , while he hoped for this and in desire offered to bribe me for my virtue , first with gifts , he said , ‘ Maiden of Cumae choose whatever you may wish , and you shall gain all that you wish . ’ I pointed to a heap of dust collected there , and foolishly replied , ‘ As many birthdays must be given to me as there are particles of sand . ’ “
140974	141067	141075	141075	Achaemenides	1197	” Sibylla with such words beguild their way from Stygian realms up to the Euboean town . Trojan Aeneas , after he had made due sacrifice in Cumae , touched the shore that had not yet been given his nurse 's name . There Macareus of Neritus had come , companion of long tried Ulysses , there he rested , weary of his lengthened toils . He recognized one left in Aetna 's cave , greek Achaemenides , and , all amazed to find him yet alive , he said to him , “
141095	141120	141087	141088	a Greek	4294	” No longer ragged in the clothes he wore and his own master , wearing clothes not tacked with sharp thorns , Achaemenides replied , “
141248	141377	141391	141392	the Cyclops	4197	“ What were my feelings when ( unless indeed my terror had deprived me of all sense ) left there , I saw you making for the open sea ? I wished to shout aloud , but was afraid it would betray me to the enemy . The shoutings of Ulysses nearly caused destruction of your ship and there I saw the Cyclops , when he tore a crag away and hurled the huge rock in the whirling waves ; I saw him also throw tremendous stones with his gigantic arms . They flew afar , as if impelled by catapults of war , I was struck dumb with terror lest the waves or stones might overwhelm the ship , forgetting that I still was on the shore ! “
141523	141581	141517	141517	he	1129	“ All this and more he said . A ghastly horror took possession of me when I saw his face and every feature streaming yet with blood , his ruthless hands , and the vile open space where his one eye had been , and his coarse limbs , and his beard matted through with human blood . “
141741	141839	141729	141729	I	0	“ Most carefully concealed for many days , trembling at every sound and fearing death , although desiring death ; I fed myself on grass and acorns , mixed with leaves ; alone and destitute , despondent unto death , awaiting my destruction I lost hope . In that condition a long while , at last I saw a ship not far off , and by signs prayed for deliverance , as I ran in haste , down to the shore . My prayers prevailed on them . A Trojan ship took in and saved a Greek ! “
141871	141999	141852	141852	me	0	” Then Macareus told him of Aeolus , the son of Hippotas , whose kingdom is the Tuscan sea , whose prison holds the winds , and how Ulysses had received the winds tied in a bull 's hide bag , an awesome gift , how nine days with a favoring breeze they sailed and saw afar their longed for native land . How , as the tenth day dawned , the crew was moved by envy and a lust for gold , which they imagined hidden in that leathern bag and so untied the thong which held the winds . These , rushing out , had driven the vessel back over the waves which they had safely passed , back to the harbor of King Aeolus . “
142003	142007	141852	141852	me	0	” he said , “
142104	142174	142101	142101	Ulysses	1129	“ Grieving , lamenting for companions lost , we finally arrived at that land which you may discern far off , and , trust my word , far off it should be seen — I saw it near ! And oh most righteous Trojan , Venus ' son , Aeneas , whom I call no more a foe , I warn you now : avoid the shores of Circe . “
142257	142332	142334	142334	handmaids	4333	“ As we drew near and stood before the door , a thousand wolves rushed out from woods near by , and with the wolves there ran she bears and lionesses , dread to see . And yet we had no cause to fear , for none would harm us with the smallest scratch . Why , they in friendship even wagged their tails and fawned upon us , while we stood in doubt . “
142437	142535	142536	142536	We	4338	“ She knew the natural use of every leaf and combinations of their virtues , when mixed properly ; and , giving them her close attention , she examined every herb as it was weighed . When she observed us there , and had received our greetings and returned them , she smiled , as if we should be well received . At once she had her maidens bring a drink of parched barley , of honey and strong wine , and curds of milk . And in the nectarous draught she added secretly her baleful drugs . “
142698	142750	142751	142753	Peace bearing Hermes	1205	“ We saw Eurylochus alone avoid our swinish form , for he refused the cup . If he had drained it , I should still remain one of a bristly herd . Nor would his news have made Ulysses sure of our disaster and brought a swift avenger of our fate . “
142851	142976	142835	142835	he	4345	“ We then were sprinkled with more favored juice of harmless plants , and smitten on the head with the magic wand reversed . And new charms were repeated , all conversely to the charms which had degraded us . Then , as she sings , more and yet more we raise ourselves erect , the bristles fall off and the fissures leave our cloven feet , our shoulders overcome their lost shape and our arms become attached , as they had been before . With tears of joy we all embrace him , also weeping tears ; and we cling fondly to our chieftain 's neck ; — not one of us could say a single word till thus we had attested gratitude . ”
142977	143130	143131	143131	Picus	1207	“ The full space of a year detained us there , and I , remaining that long stretch of time , saw many things and heard as much besides : and this among the many other things , was told me secretly by one of the four handmaidens of those rites . While Circe passed her time from all apart except my chief , she brought me to a white marble shape , a youth who bore a woodpecker upon his head . It stood erected in a hallowed place , adorned with many wreaths . When I had asked the statue 's name and why he stood revered in that most sacred temple , and what caused that bird he carried on his head ; she said : — ‘ Listen , Macareus , and learn from this tale too the power of Circe , and weigh the knowledge well ! ’ “
143294	143472	143478	143478	she	4362	“ ‘ But , heedless of all these , he loved a nymph whom on the hill , called Palatine , ' tis said , Venilia bore to Janus double faced . When she had reached the age of marriage , she was given to Picus Laurentine , preferred by her above all others — wonderful indeed her beauty , but more wonderful her skill in singing , from which art they called her Canens . The fascination of her voice would move the woods and rocks and tame wild beasts , and stay long rivers , and it even detained the wandering bird . Once , while she sang a lay with high , clear voice , Picus on his keen horse rode in Laurentian fields to hunt the boar , two spears in his left hand , his purple cloak fastened with gold . The daughter of the Sun wandered in woods near by to find new herbs growing on fertile hills , for she had left Circaean fields called so from her own name . “
143537	143545	143546	143546	she	4362	“ Still you shall not escape me , ”
143549	143582	143546	143546	she	4362	“ although you may be borne on winds , if I but know myself , and if some potency in herbs remains , and if my art of charms does not deceive . ”
143583	143747	143757	143757	she	4365	“ ‘ Such were her;thoughts , and then she formed an image of a bodiless wild swine and let it cross the trail before the king and rush into a woodland dense with trees , which fallen trunks made pathless for his horse . Picus at once , unconscious of all harm , followed the phantom - prey and , hastily quitting the reeking back of his good steed , he wandered in pursuit of a vain hope , on foot through that deep wood . She seized the chance and by her incantation called strange gods with a strange charm , which had the power to hide the white moon 's features and draw thirsty clouds about her father 's head . The changing sky then lowered more black at each repeated tone of incantation , and the ground exhaled its vapours , while his people wandered there along the darkened paths until no guard was near to aid the imperiled king . “
143760	143828	143757	143757	she	4365	“ O , youth most beautiful ! By those fine eyes , which captivated mine , and by that graceful person , which brings me , even me , a goddess , suppliant to you , have pity on my passion ; let the Sun , who looks on all things , be your father - in - law ; do not despise Circe , the Titaness . ”
143829	143839	143841	143841	you	4366	“ But fiercely he repelled her and her prayer , “
143850	143854	143855	143856	Another lady	4367	” he said . “
143905	143906	143891	143892	the Fates	8298	” “
143921	143971	143908	143910	Titan 's daughter	4372	“ You shall not leave me with impunity , and you shall not return to Canens ; and by your experience you shall now learn what can be done by her so slighted — what a woman deep in love can do — and Circe is that slighted love . ”
143972	144124	143891	143892	the Fates	8298	“ ‘ Then twice she turned herself to face the west and twice to face the East ; and three times then she touched the young man with her wand , and sang three incantations . Picus fled , but , marvelling at his unaccustomed speed , he saw new wings , that spread on either side and bore him onward . Angry at the thought of transformation — all so suddenly added a strange bird to the Latian woods , he struck the wild oaks with his hard new beak , and in his rage inflicted many wounds on the long waving branches his wings took the purple of his robe . The piece of gold which he had used so nicely in his robe was changed to golden feathers , and his neck was rich as yellow gold . Nothing remained of Picus as he was except the name . “
144248	144363	144241	144241	Hecat	1212	“ ‘ Most wonderful to tell , the forests leaped from fixed localities and the torn soil uttered deep groans , the trees surrounding changed from life - green to sick pallor , and the grass was moistened with besprinkling drops of blood ; the stones sent forth harsh longings , unknown dogs barked loudly , and the ground became a mass of filthy snakes , and unsubstantial hosts of the departed flitted without sound . The men all quaked appalled . With magic rod she touched their faces , pale and all amazed , and at her touch the youths took on strange forms of wild animals . None kept his proper shape . “
144560	144635	144636	144636	Macareus	1100	“ Such things I heard and saw through a long year . Sluggish , inactive through our idleness , we were all ordered to embark again out on the deep , again to set our sails . The Titaness explained the doubtful paths , the great extent and peril , of wild seas . I was alarmed , I will confess to you ; so , having reached these shores , I have remained . ”
144662	144696	144636	144636	Macareus	1100	“ My foster - child of proven piety , burned me Caieta here : although I was at first preserved from Argive fire , I later burned with fire which was my due . ”
144934	144942	144943	144943	he	4412	“ Lest you should think I feign , ”
144947	144971	144943	144943	he	4412	“ Although my grief must be renewed because of bitter recollections of the past , I will endure recital now to you : — “
145089	145181	145182	145182	My	0	“ Although well armed Minerva 's care preserved me then and brought me safe through rocks and waves , from my native Argos I was driven again , for outraged Venus took her full revenge remembering still that wound of long ago ; and I endured such hardships on the deep , and hazards amid armies on the shore , that often I called those happy whom the storm — an ill that came on all , or Cephareus had drowned . I even wished I had been one of them . “
145339	145471	145474	145474	his	4430	“ With language of this kind Pleuronian Acmon . Provoking Venus further than before , revived her former anger . His fierce words were then approved of by a few , while we the greater number of his real friends , rebuked the words of Acmon : and while he prepared to answer us , his voice , and even the passage of his voice , were both at once diminished , his hair changed to feathers , while his neck took a new form . His breast and back covered themselves with down , and both his arms grew longer feathers , and his elbows curved into light wings , much of each foot was changed to long toes , and his mouth grew still and hard with pointed horn . “
145543	145570	145532	145532	they	4437	“ Now as Iapygian Daunus ' son - in - law I scarcely hold this town and arid fields with my small remnant of trustworthy men . ”
145875	145914	145870	145870	she	4452	“ In vain you cast the fire with impious hand , Turnus , for I will save this burning fleet . I will not let the greedy flame consume trees that were part and members of my grove . ”
146497	146569	146485	146485	Venus	996	“ My father , ever kind to me , I do beseech your kind indulgence now ; grant , dearest , to Aeneas , my own son and also your own grandson , grant to him a godhead power , although of lowest class , sufficient if but granted . It is enough to have looked once upon the unlovely realm . And once to have gone across the Stygian streams . ”
146591	146623	146624	146624	He	1574	“ You well deserve the gift , both you who ask it , and the one for whom you ask it : what you most desire is yours , my daughter . ”
147417	147425	147410	147410	he	1238	“ But you are so much lovelier ! ”
147497	147668	147494	147494	he	1238	“ But only think , if this trunk stood unwedded to this vine , it would have nothing to attract our hearts beyond its leaves , and this delightful vine , united to the elm tree finds its rest ; but , if not so joined to it , would fall down , prostrate upon the ground . And yet you find no warning in the example of this tree . You have avoided marriage , with no wish to be united — I must wish that you would change and soon desire it . Helen would not have so many suitors for her hand , nor she who caused the battles of the Lapithae , nor would the wife of timid , and not bold , Ulysses . Even now , while you avoid those who are courting you , and while you turn in your disgust , a thousand suitors want to marry you — the demigods and gods , and deities of Alba 's mountain - tops . “
147869	147969	147970	147970	You	4534	“ And only think , have you not the same tastes ? Will he not be the first to welcome fruits which are your great delight ? And does he not hold your gifts safely in his glad right hand ? But now he does not long for any fruit plucked from the tree , and has no thought of herbs with pleasant juices that the garden gives ; he can not think of anything but you . Have pity on his passion , and believe that he who woos you is here and he pleads with my lips . “
148045	148211	148255	148255	she	4548	“ Iphis , born of a humble family , had seen the famed Anaxarete , who was of the race of ancient Teucer . — He had seen her and felt fire inflame his bones . Struggling a long time , he could not subdue his passion by his reason , so he came a suppliant to her doors . And having now confessed his ardent passion to her nurse , besought her by the hopes reposed in her by the loved girl , not to give him a cold heart and at another time , with fair words given to each of many servants he besought their kindest interest with an anxious voice . He often gave them coaxing words engraved on tablets of soft wax ; and sometimes he would fasten garlands , wet with dew of tears , upon the door - posts ; and he often laid his tender side nightlong on the hard threshold , sadly reproaching the obdurate bolt . “
148281	148360	148364	148364	you	4550	“ Iphis , unable to endure such pain prolonged , spoke these , his final words , before her door : ‘ Anaxarete , you have conquered me , and you shall have no more annoyances to bear from me . Be joyful and prepare your triumph , and invoke god Paean , crown yourself with shining laurel . You are now my conqueror , and I resigned will die . Woman of iron , rejoice in victory ! “
148520	148566	148576	148576	You	4550	“ Then to the doorpost which he often had adorned with floral wreaths he lifted up his swimming eyes and both his pallid arms , and , when he had fastened over the capital a rope that held a dangling noose , he said , — “
148582	148606	148615	148615	his	0	” — Then , thrust in his head , turning even then towards her , and hung a hapless weight with broken neck . “
148679	148805	148649	148649	they	4556	“ She held him to her bosom and embraced the cold limbs of her dead child . After she had uttered words so natural to the grief of wretched mothers — after she had done what wretched mothers do at such sad times , she led a tearful funeral through the streets , the pale corpse following high upon the bier , on to a pyre laid in the central square . By chance , Anaxarete 's house was near the way through which the mournful funeral was going with the corpse , and the sad sound of wailing reached the ears of that proud girl — hardhearted , and already goaded on by an avenging god . Moved by the sound , she said ; “
148813	148918	148649	148649	they	4556	” And she ascended to an upper room , provided with wide windows . Scarcely had she looked at Iphis , laid out on the bier , when her eyes stiffened , and she turned all white , as warm blood left her body . She tried then to turn back from the window , but she stood transfixed there . She then tried to turn her face away from that sad sight , but could not move ; and by degrees the stone , which always had existed , petrified in her cold breast , and took possession of her heart and limbs . “
148999	149537	148958	148958	her	5026	” When the god , fitted for every shape , had said these words in vain , he laid the old woman 's form aside and was again a youth . On her he seemed to blaze , as when the full light of the brilliant Sun , after it has dispelled opposing clouds , has shone forth with not one to intercept . He purposed violence , but there was then no need of force . The lovely nymph was charmed , was captivated by the god 's bright form and felt a passion answering to his love . At Proca 's death unjust Amulius seized with his troops the whole Ausonian wealth . And yet old Numitor , obtaining aid from his two grandsons , won the land again which he had lost ; and on the festival of Pales were the city walls begun . King Tatius with his Sabines went to war ; Tarpeia , who betrayed the citadel , died justly underneath the weight of arms . Then troops from Cures crept , like silent wolves , without a word toward men subdued by sleep and tried the gates that Ilia 's son had barred . Then Saturn 's daughter opened wide a gate , turning the silent hinge . Venus alone perceived the bars of that gate falling down . She surely would have closed it , were it not impossible for any deity to countervail the acts of other gods . The Naiads of Ausonia occupied a spring that welled up close to Janus ' fane . To them she prayed for aid . The fountain - nymphs could not resist the prayer of Venus , when she made her worthy plea and they released all waters under ground . Till then the path by Janus ' fane was open , never yet had floods risen to impede the way . But now they laid hot sulphur of a faint blue light beneath the streaming fountain and with care applied fire to the hallowed ways with smoking pitch . By these and many other violent means hot vapors penetrated to the source of the good fountain . — Only think of it ! Those waters which had rivalled the cold Alps , now rivalled with their heat the flames themselves ! And , while each gate post steamed with boiling spray , the gate , which had been opened ( but in vain ) to hardy Sabines just outside , was made impassable by the heated fountain 's flood , till Roman soldiers had regained their arms . After brave Romulus had led them forth and covered Roman ground with Sabines dead and its own people ; and the accursed sword shed blood of father - in - law and son - in - law , with peace they chose at last to end the war , rather than fight on to the bitter end : Tatius and Romulus divide the throne . Tatius had fallen , and you , O Romulus , were giving laws to peoples now made one , when Mars put off his helmet and addressed the father of gods and men in words like these : “
149655	149860	149652	149652	your	4569	” The god all - powerful nodded his assent , and he obscured the air with heavy clouds and on a trembling world he sent below harsh thunder and bright lightning . Mars at once perceived it was a signal plainly given for promised change — so , leaning on a spear , he mounted boldly into his chariot , and over bloodstained yoke and eager steeds he swung and cracked the loud - resounding lash . Descending through steep air , he halted on the wooded summit of the Palatine and there , while Ilia 's son was giving laws — needing no pomp and circumstance of kings , Mars caught him up . His mortal flesh dissolved into thin air , as when a ball of lead shot up from a broad sling melts all away and soon is lost in heaven . A nobler shape was given him , one more fitted to adorn rich couches in high heaven , the shape divine of Quirinus clad in the trabea . His queen , Hersilia , wept continually , regarding him as lost , till regal Juno commanded Iris to glide down along her curving bow and bring to her these words : “
149932	149966	149967	149967	Goddess	1607	” Iris obeyed her will , and , gliding down to earth along her tinted bow , conveyed the message to Hersilia ; who replied , with modest look and hardly lifted eye , “
150033	150254	150025	150025	I	0	” At once Hersilia and the virgin child of Thaumas , went together up the hill of Romulus . Descending through thin air there came a star , and then Hersilia her tresses glowing fiery in the light , rose with that star , as it returned through air . And her the founder of the Roman state received with dear , familiar hands . He changed her old time form and with the form her name . He called her Hora and let her become a goddess , now the mate of Quirinus . While this was happening , they began to seek for one who could endure the weight of such a task and could succeed a king so great ; and Fame , the harbinger of truth , destined illustrious Numa for the sovereign power . It did not satisfy his heart to know only the Sabine ceremonials , and he conceived in his expansive mind much greater views , examining the depth and cause of things . His country and his cares forgotten , this desire led him to visit the city that once welcomed Hercules . Numa desired to know what founder built a Grecian city on Italian shores . One of the old inhabitants , who was well acquainted with past history , replied : “
150444	150501	150432	150432	he	4599	“ Sleep and the god departed instantly . Alemon 's son , arising from his couch , pondered his recent vision thoughtfully , with his conclusions at cross purposes . — the god commanded him to quit that land , the laws forbade departure , threatening death to all who sought to leave their native land . “
150593	150667	150584	150584	he	4608	“ The accusation hardly had been made when his offense was evidently proved , even without a witness . Then he raised his face and hands up to the gods above and suppliant in neglected garb , exclaimed , ‘ Oh mighty Hercules , for whom alone the twice six labors gave the privilege of heavenly residence , give me your aid , for you were the true cause of my offence . ’ “
150765	150883	150755	150755	Hercules	857	“ Myscelus , breathing thanks to Hercules , with favoring wind sailed on the Ionian sea , past Sallentine Neretum , Sybaris , Spartan Tarentum , and the Sirine Bay , Crimisa , and on beyond the Iapygian fields . Then , skirting shores which face these lands , he found the place foretold the river Aesar 's mouth , and found not far away a burial mound which covered with its soil the hallowed bones of Croton . — There , upon the appointed land , he built up walls — and he conferred the name of Croton , who was there entombed , on his new city , which has ever since been called Crotona . ”
151134	151139	151140	151140	he	5610	“ No , mortals , ”
151144	151213	151140	151140	he	5610	“ Do not permit pollution of your bodies with such food , for there are grain and good fruits which bear down the branches by their weight , and ripened grapes upon the vines , and herbs — those sweet by nature and those which will grow tender and mellow with a fire , and flowing milk is not denied , nor honey , redolent of blossoming thyme . “
151288	151388	151625	151625	she	4635	“ Oh , ponder a moment such a monstrous crime — vitals in vitals gorged , one greedy body fattening with plunder of another 's flesh , a living being fed on another 's life ! In that abundance , which our Earth , the best of mothers , will afford have you no joy , unless your savage teeth can gnaw the piteous flesh of some flayed animal to reenact the Cyclopean crime ? And can you not appease the hungry void — the perverted craving of a stomach 's greed , unless you first destroy another life ? “
151481	151596	151842	151855	A victim free of blemish and most beautiful in form ( perfection brings destruction	4638	“ After that time some one of ill advice ( it does not matter who it might have been ) envied the ways of lions and gulped into his greedy paunch stuff from a carcass vile . He opened the foul paths of wickedness . It may be that in killing beasts of prey our steel was for the first time warmed with blood . And that could be defended , for I hold that predatory creatures which attempt destruction of mankind , are put to death without evasion of the sacred laws : but , though with justice they are put to death , that can not be a cause for eating them . “
151671	151841	151992	151992	you	4643	“ But why have sheep deserved sad destiny , harmless and useful for the good of man with nectar in full udders ? Their soft wool affords the warmest coverings for our use , their life and not their death would help us more . Why have the oxen of the field deserved a sad end — innocent , without deceit , and harmless , without guile , born to endure hard labor ? Without gratitude is he , unworthy of the gift of harvest fields , who , after he relieved his worker from weight of the curving plow could butcher him , could sever with an axe that toil worn neck , by which so often with hard work the ground had been turned up , so many harvests reared . For some , even crimes like these are not enough , they have imputed to the gods themselves abomination — they believe a god in heaven above , rejoices at the death of a laborious ox . “
152001	152128	152207	152207	souls	4647	“ And , since a god impels me to speak out , I will obey the god who urges me , and will disclose to you the heavens above , and I will even reveal the oracles of the Divine Will . I will sing to you of things most wonderful , which never were investigated by the intellects of ancient times and things which have been long concealed from man . In fancy I delight to float among the stars or take my stand on mighty Atlas ' shoulders , and to look afar down on men wandering here and there — afraid in life yet dreading unknown death , and in these words exhort them and reveal the sequence of events ordained by fate ! “
152234	152464	152788	152788	you	4654	“ I can declare , for I remember well , that in the days of the great Trojan War , I was Euphorbus , son of Panthous . In my opposing breast was planted then the heavy spear - point of the younger son of Atreus . Not long past I recognised the shield , once burden of my left arm , where it hung in Juno 's temple at ancient Argos , the realm of Abas . Everything must change : but nothing perishes . The moving soul may wander , coming from that spot to this , from this to that — in changed possession live in any limbs whatever . It may pass from beasts to human bodies , and again to those of beasts . The soul will never die , in the long lapse of time . As pliant wax is moulded to new forms and does not stay as it has been nor keep the self same form yet is the selfsame wax , be well assured the soul is always the same spirit , though it passes into different forms . Therefore , that natural love may not be vanquished by unnatural craving of the appetite , I warn you , stop expelling kindred souls by deeds abhorrent as cold murder . — Let not blood be nourished with its kindred blood ! “
152606	152784	152984	152984	Our	4658	“ You see how night glides by and then proceeds on to the dawn , then brilliant light of day succeeds the dark night . There is not the same appearance in the heavens , : when all things for weariness are resting in vast night , as when bright Lucifer rides his white steed . And only think of that most glorious change , when loved Aurora , Pallas ' daughter , comes before the day and tints the world , almost delivered to bright Phoebus . Even the disk of that god , rising from beneath the earth , is of a ruddy color in the dawn and ruddy when concealed beneath the world . When highest , it is a most brilliant white , for there the ether is quite purified , and far away avoids infection from impurities of earth . Diana 's form at night remains not equal nor the same ! ' Tis less today than it will be tomorrow , if she is waxing ; greater , if she wanes . “
152877	152918	152984	152984	Our	4658	“ The year now waxing stronger , after Spring it passes into Summer , and its youth becomes robust . Indeed of all the year the Summer is most vigorous and most abounds with glowing and life - giving warmth . “
152957	152983	153062	153062	she	570	“ Then aged Winter with his tremulous step follows , repulsive , strips of graceful locks or white with those he has retained so long . “
153071	153158	153244	153244	you	4666	“ Brought into light , the helpless infant lies . Then on all fours he lifts his body up , feeling his way , like any young wild beast , and then by slow degrees he stands upright , weak - kneed and trembling , steadied by support of some convenient prop . And soon more strong and swift he passes through the hours of youth , and , when the years of middle age are past , slides down the steep path of declining age . “

153447	153558	153842	153842	you	4680	“ Nothing retains the form that seems its own , and Nature , the renewer of all things , continually changes every form into some other shape . Believe my word , in all this universe of vast extent , not one thing ever perished . All have changed appearance . Men say a certain thing is born , if it takes a different form from what it had ; and yet they say , that certain thing has died , if it no longer keeps the self same shape . Though distant things move near , and near things far , always the sum of all things is unchanged . “
153720	153800	153860	153861	the Centaurs	1117	“ So , when the Lycus has been swallowed by a chasm in the earth , it rushes forth at a distance and is reborn a different stream . The Erasinus now flows down into a cave , now runs beneath the ground a darkened course , then rises lordly in the Argolic fields . They say the Mysus , wearied of his spring and of his former banks , appears elsewhere and takes another name , the Caicus . “
153908	154013	154328	154328	them	4692	“ Antissa , Pharos , and Phoenician Tyre , were once surrounded by the wavy sea : they are not islands now . Long years ago Leucas was mainland , if we can believe what the old timers there will tell , but now the waves sweep round it . Zancle was a part of Italy , until the sea cut off the neighboring land with strong waves in between . Should you seek Helice and Buris , those two cities of Achaea , you will find them underneath the waves , where sailors point to sloping roofs and streets in the clear deep . “
154142	154280	154501	154501	they	4703	“ Of many strange events that I have heard and known , I will add a few . Why , does not water give and take strange forms ? Your wave , O horned Ammon , will turn cold at mid - day , but is always mild and warm at sun - rise and at sun - set . I have heard that Athamanians kindle wood , if they pour water on it , when the waning moon has shrunk away into her smallest orb . The people of Ciconia have a stream which turns the drinker 's entrails into stone , which changes into marble all it raves . The Achaean Crathis and the Sybaris , which flow not far from here , will turn the hair to something like clear amber or bright gold . “

154695	154764	154798	154799	Scythian women	4710	“ Or if some black bitumen catches fire or yellow sulphur burns with little smoke , then surely , when the ground no longer gives such food and oily nutriment for flames and they in time have ravined all their store , their greedy nature soon will pine with death — it will not bear such famine but depart and , when deserted , will desert the place . “

These , like the faithful animals from which they were produced , inhabit the green fields , delight in toil , and labor for reward . “
154964	155082	155321	155321	they	4718	“ The worms which cover leaves with their white threads , a thing observable by husbandmen , will change themselves to funeral butterflies . Mud holds the seeds that generate green frogs , at first producing tadpoles with no feet , and soon it gives them legs adapted for their swimming , and , so they may be as well adapted to good leaping , their hind legs are longer than the fore - legs . The mother bear does not bring forth a cub but a limp mass of flesh that hardly can be called alive . By licking it the mother forms the limbs , and brings it to a shape just like her own . “
155185	155278	155321	155321	they	4718	“ Now these I named derive their origin from other living forms . There is one bird which reproduces and renews itself : the Assyrians gave this bird his name — the Phoenix . He does not live either on grain or herbs , but only on small drops of frankincense and juices of amomum . When this bird completes a full five centuries of life straightway with talons and with shining beak he builds a nest among palm branches , where they join to form the palm tree 's waving top . “
155346	155417	155538	155538	Phoebus	549	“ When time has given to him sufficient strength and he is able to sustain the weight , he lifts the nest up from the lofty tree and dutifully carries from that place his cradle and the parent 's sepulchre . As soon as he has reached through yielding air the city of Hyperion , he will lay the burden just before the sacred doors within the temple of Hyperion . “
155480	155531	155742	155742	They	4732	“ Conquered India gave to the vine crowned Bacchus lynxes , whose urine turns , they say to stones , hardening in air . So coral , too , as soon as it has risen above the sea , turns hard . Below the waves it was a tender plant . “
155686	155741	155872	155872	yourself	3929	“ Reports come to me that Dardanian Rome is rising , and beside the Tiber 's waves , whose springs are high in the Apennines , is laying her deep foundations . So in her growth her form is changing , and one day she will be the sole mistress of the boundless world . “
155874	156013	156270	156270	Boreas	460	“ Even now I know it is decreed by Fate that our posterity , born far from Troy , will build a city greater than exists , or ever will exist , or ever has been seen in former times . Through a long lapse of ages other noted men shall make it strong , but one of the race of Iulus ; shall make it the great mistress of the world . After the earth has thoroughly enjoyed his glorious life , aetherial abodes shall gain him , and immortal heaven shall be his destiny . ’ Such was the prophesy of Helenus , when great Aeneas took away his guardian deities , and I rejoice to see my kindred walls rise high and realize how much the Trojans won by that resounding victory of the Greeks ! “
156149	156242	156367	156367	They	4751	“ How greatly does a man disgrace himself , how impiously does he prepare himself for shedding human blood , who with u knife cuts the calf 's throat and offers a deaf ear to its death - longings ! who can kill the kid while it is sending forth heart rending cries like those of a dear child ; or who can feed upon the bird which he has given food . How little do such deeds as these fall short of actual murder ? Yes , where will they lead ? “
156293	156366	156530	156533	the son of Theseus	4767	“ Away with cruel nets and springs and snares and fraudulent contrivances : deceive not birds with bird - limed twigs : do not deceive the trusting deer with dreaded feather foils : do not conceal barbed hooks with treacherous bait : if any beast is harmful , take his life , but , even so , let killing be enough . Taste not his flesh , but look for harmless food ! ”
156537	156589	156693	156693	she	4771	“ Control your sorrow ; surely your sad lot is not the only one ; consider now the like calamities by others borne , and you can bear your sorrow . To my grief my own disaster was far worse than yours . At least it can afford you comfort now . “
156702	156808	157033	157033	I	0	“ Though I was guiltless of all wrong , my father banished me and , while I was departing , laid on me a mortal curse . Towards Pittheus and Troezen I fled aghast , guiding the swift chariot near the shore of the Corinthian Gulf , when all at once the sea rose up and seemed to arch itself and lift high as a white topped mountain height , make bellowings , and open at the crest . Then through the parting waves a horned bull emerged with head and breast into the wind , spouting white foam from his nostrils and his mouth . “
156929	157032	157137	157137	she	1263	“ I was thrown forward from my chariot and with the reins entwined about my legs . My palpitating entrails could be seen dragged on , my sinews fastened on a stump . My torn legs followed , but a part remained behind me , caught by various snags . The breaking bones gave out a crackling noise , my tortured spirit soon had fled away , no part of the torn body could be known — all that was left was only one crushed wound — how can , how dare you , nymph , compare your ills to my disaster ? “
157148	157249	157544	157544	he	1270	“ A long time she debated whether she would give me Crete or Delos for my home . Delos and Crete abandoned , she then brought me here , and at the same time ordered me to lay aside my former name — one which when mentioned would remind me of my steeds . She said to me , ‘ You were Hippolytus , but now instead you shall be Virbius . ’ And from that time I have inhabited this grove ; and , as one of the lesser gods , I live concealed and numbered in her train . ”
157547	157591	157683	157683	he	4788	“ You gods above ! Whatever is foretold by this great prodigy , if it means good , then let it be auspicious to my land and to the inhabitants of Quirinus , — if ill , let that misfortune fall on me . ”
157675	157682	157683	157683	he	4788	“ O king , all hail ! ”
157686	157751	157756	157756	he	1270	“ For in future time this country and the Latin towers will live in homage to you , Cippus , and your horns . But you must promptly put aside delay ; hasten to enter the wide open gates — the fates command you . Once received within the city , you shall be its chosen king and safely shall enjoy a lasting reign . ”
157769	157809	157863	157863	he	1270	“ O far , O far away , the righteous gods should drive such omens from me ! Better it would be that I should pass my life in exile than be seen a king throned in the capitol . ”
157866	157936	158079	158079	he	4792	“ There is one here who will be king , if you do not expel him from your city — I will show him to you surely by a sign ; although I will not tell his name . He wears horns on his head . The augur prophecies that , if he enters this your city , he will give you laws as if you were his slaves . “
158014	158076	158079	158079	he	4792	” As murmurs which arise among the groves of pine trees thick above us , when the fierce east wind is whistling in them , or as sound produced by breaking waves , when it is heard afar off , such the noise made by the crowd . But in that angry stirring of the throng one cry could be distinguished , “
158081	158098	158099	158103	The man whom you demand	4798	” And they examined foreheads , and they sought predicted horns . Cippus then spoke again : “
158105	158109	158099	158103	The man whom you demand	4798	” he said , “
158113	158448	158725	158725	your	4802	” And , fearless of the people , he threw back the chaplet from his forehead , so that all could see his temples plainly , wonderful for their two horns . All then turned down their eyes and uttered groans and ( was it possible ? ) they looked unwillingly upon that head famed for its merit . They could not permit him to remain there long , deprived of honors , and they placed upon his head the festive chaplet . And the Senate gave you , Cippus , since you nevermore must come within the walls , a proof of their esteem — so much land as your oxen and their plow could circle round from dawn to setting sun . Moreover they engraved the shapely horns on the bronze pillars of the city gate , which for long ages kept his name revered . Relate , O Muses , guardian deities of poets ( for you know , and the remote antiquity conceals it not from you ) , the reason why an island , which the deep stream of Tiber closed about , has introduced Coronis ' child among the deities guarding the city of famed Romulus . A dire contagion had infested long the Latin air , and men 's pale bodies were deformed by a consumption that dried up the blood . When , frightened by so many deaths , they found all mortal efforts could avail them nothing , and physicians ' skill had no effect , they sought the aid of heaven . They sent envoys to Delphi center of the world , and they entreated Phoebus to give aid in their distress , and by response renew their wasting lives and end a city 's woe . While ground , and laurels and the quivers which the god hung there all shook , the tripod gave this answer from the deep recesses hid within the shrine , and stirred with trembling their astonished hearts — “
158501	158723	158986	158987	the god	5013	” After the prudent Senate had received Phoebus Apollo 's words , they took much pains to learn what town the son of Phoebus might inhabit . They despatched ambassadors under full sail to the coast of Epidaurus . When the curved ships had touched the shore , these men in haste went to the Grecian elders there and prayed that Rome might have the deity whose presence would drive out the mortal ill from their Ausonian nation ; for they knew response unerring had directed them . The councillors dismayed , could not agree on their reply : some thought that aid ought not to be refused , but many more held back , declaring it was wise to keep the god for their own safety and not give away a guardian deity . And , while they talked , discussing it , the twilight had expelled the waning day , and darkness on the earth spread a thick mantle over the wide world . Then in your sleep , the healing deity appeared , O Roman leader , by your couch , as in his temple he is used to stand , holding in his left hand a rustic staff . Stroking his long beard with his right , he seemed to utter from his kindly breast these words : “
158800	158984	158986	158987	the god	5013	” The god departed , when he said those words ; and sleep went , when the god and words were gone ; and genial light came , when the sleep had left . The morning then dispersed fire - given stars . The envoys met together in much doubt within the temple of the long sought god . They prayed the god to indicate for them , by clear celestial tokens , in what spot he wished to dwell . Scarce had they ceased the prayer for guidance , when the god all glittering with gold and as a serpent , crest erect , sent forth a hissing as to notify a quick approach — and in his coming shook his statue and the altars and the doors , the marble pavement and the gilded roof . Then up to his breast the serpent stood erect within the temple . He gazed on all with eyes that sparkled fire . The waiting multitude was frightened ; but the priest , his chaste hair bound with a white fillet , knew the deity . “
158989	158993	158996	158997	the god	5013	” he cried , “
159038	160029	160188	160188	I	0	” All present then adored the deity as bidden by the priest . The multitude repeated his good words , and the descendants of Aeneas gave good omen , with their feelings and their speech . Nodding well pleased and moving his great crest , the god at once assured them of his favor and hissed repeatedly with darting tongue . And then he glided down the polished steps ; turned back his head ; and , ready to depart , gazed on the altars he had known for so long — a last salute to the temple of his love . While all the people strewed his way with flowers , the great snake wound in sinuous course along and , passing through the middle of their town , came to the harbor and its curving wall . He stopped there , and it seemed that he dismissed his train and dutiful attendant crowd , and with a placid countenance he placed his mighty body in the Ausonian ship , which plainly showed the great weight of the god . The glad descendants of Aeneas all rejoiced , and they sacrificed a bull beside the harbor , wreathed the ship with flowers , and loosed the twisted hawsers from the shore . As a soft breeze impelled the ship , within her curving stern the god reclined , his coils uprising high , and gazed down on the blue Ionian waves . So wafted by the favoring winds , they came in six days to the shores of Italy . There he was borne past the Lacinian Cape , ennobled by the goddess Juno 's shrine , and Scylacean coasts . He left behind Iapygia ; then he shunned Amphrysian rocks upon the left and on the other side escaped Cocinthian crags . He passed , near by , Romechium and Caulon and Naricia ; crossed the Sicilian sea ; went through the strait ; sailed by Pelorus and the island home of Aeolus and by the copper mines of Temesa . He turned then toward Leucosia and toward mild Paestum , famous for the rose . He coasted by Capreae and around Minerva 's promontory and the hills ennobled with Surrentine vines , from there to Herculaneum and Stabiae and then Parthenope built for soft ease . He sailed near the Cumaean Sibyl 's temple . He passed the Warm Springs and Linternum , where the mastick trees grow , and the river called Volturnus , where thick sand whirls in the stream , over to Sinuessa 's snow - white doves ; and then to Antium and its rocky coast . When with all sails full spread the ship came in the harbor there ( for now the seas grew rough ) , the god uncoiled his folds , and , gliding out with sinuous curves and all his mighty length , entered the temple of his parent , where it skirts that yellow shore . But , when the sea was calm again , the Epidaurian god departing from his father 's shrine , where he a while had shared the sacred residence reared to a kindred deity , furrowed the sandy shore with weight of crackling scales , again he climbed into the lofty stern and near the rudder laid his head at rest . There he remained until the vessel passed by Castrum and Lavinium 's sacred homes to where the Tiber flows into the sea there all the people of Rome came rushing out — mothers and fathers and even those who tend your sacred fire , O Trojan goddess Vesta — and joyous shouted welcome to the god . Wherever the swift ship steered through the tide , they built up many altars in a line , so that perfuming frankincense with smoke crackled along the banks on either hand , and victims made the keen knives hot with blood . The serpent - deity has entered Rome , the world 's new capital and , lifting up his head above the summit of the mast , looked far and near for a congenial home . The river there , dividing , flows about a place known as the Island , on both sides an equal stream glides past dry middle ground . And here the serpent child of Phoebus left the Roman ship , took his own heavenly form , and brought the mourning city health once more Apollo 's son came to us from abroad , but Caesar is a god in his own land . The first in war and peace , he rose by wars , which closed in triumphs , and by civic deeds to glory quickly won , and even more his offspring 's love exalted him as a new , a heavenly , sign and brightly flaming star . Of all the achievements of great Julius Caesar not one is more ennobling to his fame than being father of his glorious son . Was it more glorious for him to subdue the Britons guarded by their sheltering sea or lead his fleet victorious up the stream seven mouthed of the papyrus hearing Nile ; to bring beneath the Roman people s rule rebel Numidia , Libyan Juba , and strong Pontus , proud of Mithridates ' fame ; to have some triumphs and deserve far more ; than to be father of so great a man , with whom as ruler of the human race , O gods , you bless us past all reckoning ? And , lest that son should come from mortal seed , Julius Caesar must change and be a god . When the golden mother of Aeneas was aware of this and saw a grievous end plotted against her high priest , saw the armed conspiracy preparing for his death , with pallid face she met each god and said : “
160208	160562	160688	160688	I	0	” Such words as these , full of her anxious thoughts , Venus proclaimed through all the heavens , in vain . The gods were moved , and , since they could not break the ancient sisters ' iron decree , they gave instead clear portents of approaching woe . It is declared , resounding arms heard from the black clouds and unearthly trumpet blasts and clarions heard through all the highest heavens , forewarned men of the crime . The sad sun 's face gave to the frightened world a livid light ; and in the night - time torches seemed to burn amid the stars , and often drops of blood fell in rain - showers . Then Lucifer shone blue with all his visage stained by darksome rust . The chariot of the moon was sprinkled with red blood . The Stygian owl gave to the world ill omens . In a thousand places , tears were shed by the ivory statues . Dirges , too , are said to have been heard , and threatening words by unknown speakers in the sacred groves . No victim gave an omen of good life : the fibers showed great tumults imminent , the liver 's cut - off edge was found among the entrails . In the Forum , it is said , and round men 's homes and temples of the gods dogs howled all through the night , and silent shades wandered abroad , and earthquakes shook the city . But portents of the gods could not avert the plots of men and stay approaching fate . Into a temple naked swords were brought — into the Senate House . No other place in all our city was considered fit for perpetrating such a dreadful crime ! With both hands Cytherea beat her breast , and in a cloud she strove to hide the last of great Aeneas ' line , as in times past she had hid Paris from fierce Menelaus Aeneas from the blade of Diomed . But Jove , her father , cautioned her and said , “
160704	160778	160934	160934	he	1283	“ Venus , the man on whose behalf you are so anxious , already has completed his alloted time . The years are ended which he owed to life on earth . You with his son , who now as heir to his estate must bear the burden of that government , will cause him , as a deity , to reach the heavens , and to be worshipped in the temples here . “
160890	160925	None	None	None	None	“ Why should I mention all the barbarous lands and nations east and west by ocean 's rim ? Whatever habitable earth contains shall bow to him , the sea shall serve his will ! “
